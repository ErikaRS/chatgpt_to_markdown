What is a good 1-2 word phrase to add to a list of status options to communicate that a project is mostly done but just has some remaining cleanup work (which generally can't be done right away because we need to make sure the thing is stable)?

How about:

1. **Stabilizing**
2. **Polishing**
3. **Tidying Up**
4. **Finalizing**
5. **Cooling Down**

These convey that the main work is done but some post-completion activities are still ongoing. Do any of these resonate with the tone you're aiming for?
