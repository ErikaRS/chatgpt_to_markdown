There are a few common concerns people have about soy, which contribute to its sometimes negative perception:

1. **Phytoestrogens**: Soy contains compounds called isoflavones, which can mimic estrogen in the body. Some people worry this might affect hormone levels and disrupt endocrine function, although research generally shows these effects are mild and soy consumption is safe for most people.

2. **GMOs**: A large portion of soy grown globally is genetically modified (GMO). Some consumers prefer to avoid GMOs due to concerns about the environmental impact and potential health risks, despite broad scientific consensus that GMO foods are safe to eat.

3. **Allergies**: Soy is one of the eight most common allergens. People who are allergic to soy must avoid it to prevent potentially serious reactions.

4. **Anti-nutrients**: Soybeans contain anti-nutrients like phytates, which can interfere with the absorption of certain minerals. However, traditional preparation methods like fermenting and soaking can reduce these compounds significantly.

5. **Impact on certain conditions**: While soy is generally considered healthy, there are concerns about its consumption in relation to specific health conditions like thyroid disorders, where it might interfere with thyroid hormone production and absorption.

Overall, for most people, moderate consumption of soy as part of a varied diet is considered healthy. It provides a good source of protein, fiber, and several vitamins and minerals.
