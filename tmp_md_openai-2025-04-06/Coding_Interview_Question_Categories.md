What are categories one might apply to coding interview questions? E.g., Algorithms? In particular, I need a label for practical questions like building a tool where the complexity is in working with real APIs

For categorizing coding interview questions, it's helpful to consider both the domain of the problem and the nature of the skills being tested. Here are some categories that you can apply:

1. **Algorithms**: Problems focusing on algorithmic solutions, typically involving sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph traversal, etc.

2. **Data Structures**: Questions that test understanding and application of data structures like arrays, linked lists, hash maps, trees, stacks, queues, graphs, etc.

3. **System Design**: Problems that require designing a larger system, focusing on architecture, scalability, data flow, and high-level components.

4. **Problem Solving**: Questions that test logical thinking and the ability to break down complex problems, often presented as puzzles or abstract problems.

5. **API Integration / Practical Implementation**: These questions are focused on building something practical, where the emphasis is on integrating with real APIs, handling I/O, and managing state. This could involve implementing a tool, creating a REST client, or building a simple web scraper, for example. You could use the term **"Practical Tool Building"** or **"API Integration & Real-World Problem Solving"** for such questions.

6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Questions that test knowledge of OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, often by designing classes and methods.

7. **Concurrency / Parallelism**: Questions that deal with managing concurrent processes, synchronization issues, and understanding parallel computing.

8. **Database and SQL**: Problems that involve working with databases, writing SQL queries, and understanding data modeling concepts.

9. **Code Quality / Refactoring**: Questions focused on improving existing code, making it more readable, modular, or performant.

10. **Debugging**: Questions where the candidate is given code with bugs and asked to identify and fix the issues.

11. **Domain-Specific Challenges**: Sometimes there are questions tailored to specific industries or domains, such as financial calculations, handling geospatial data, or string manipulation in natural language processing.

For practical questions like building a tool where complexity comes from working with real APIs, a suitable label could be **"API Integration & Practical Tooling"** or **"Real-World Implementation & API Work"** to highlight the applied, hands-on nature of the challenge.

Categorize this question with all applicable labels: 
Write a command line program which takes a number and displays the “LED” version of this number using underscores and vertical bars:

$ led 757
 _  _  _ 
  ||_   |
  | _|  |

The first goal is just to get the above working. This likely will not take all of the time. Use the stretch goals below to fill the time:
Add a second parameter for bar length:
$ led 757 2
 __  __  __ 
   ||      |
   ||__    |
   |   |   |
   | __|   |
How do we test this for correctness? Write the tests.
How do we test this for performance? Write the tests.

The given question can be categorized under multiple labels:

1. **Problem Solving**: It requires breaking down the problem logically to represent numbers in an "LED" format.

2. **Practical Tool Building**: The task involves building a practical command-line utility, demonstrating implementation skills beyond algorithms.

3. **String Manipulation**: The question involves generating specific patterns of underscores and vertical bars to display numbers, which is heavily reliant on string manipulation.

4. **Testing & Code Quality**: The prompt asks about correctness and performance testing, requiring the candidate to think about testing strategies and code robustness.

5. **Algorithm Design**: The candidate needs to determine a suitable approach to convert the number into a visual representation that resembles an LED display.

6. **Input/Output Handling**: Since this is a command line program, it involves handling user inputs and outputs effectively.

This question requires both creative problem-solving and practical coding skills, along with a focus on testing and quality assurance. Labels like **"String Manipulation & Practical Tooling"** or **"CLI Development & Testing"** might also be apt to describe the nature of the task.

Let's simplify the schema to three labels: Algorithm, Practical implementation, and Problem solving

### Assistant - 2024-10-17 15:54:10

Using the simplified schema of three labels, the given question can be categorized as follows:

1. **Practical Implementation**: The task involves creating a command line program, emphasizing practical coding skills to solve a real-world-like problem.

2. **Problem Solving**: The candidate needs to break down the problem logically to represent the number in an LED format, requiring structured thinking.

3. **Algorithm**: The solution involves designing an approach to convert numerical input into a specific visual representation, which requires basic algorithmic thinking.

So, all three labels—**Algorithm, Practical Implementation, and Problem Solving**—are applicable here.

Which one is best?

### Assistant - 2024-10-17 15:54:20

The best label for this question is **Practical Implementation**.

Here's why:

- The emphasis is on creating a working command line utility, which aligns strongly with **Practical Implementation**.
- While there are elements of **Problem Solving** and **Algorithm**, they are relatively straightforward in this case—mostly about generating the LED representation and handling input/output. The main focus is on coding a practical, functional tool.

So, **Practical Implementation** best captures the core nature of this task, especially considering the emphasis on building and extending the functionality, as well as testing.
