"Cut on the bias" refers to a method of cutting fabric at a 45-degree angle to the straight grain of the fabric. This technique is often used in sewing to create garments that drape well and have a bit of stretchiness due to the diagonal alignment of the fabric's threads. It's commonly seen in clothing items like bias-cut dresses or skirts. The bias cut allows the fabric to follow the curves of the body more naturally and can create interesting visual effects with patterns and textures.
