I'm worried this message (mostly the first paragraph) may come across as a bit critical / aggressive. Suggest a more collaborative framing.

@kevin.chen, I'm a bit concerned that the pushback from your side seems to focused on process reasons. I'd love to see us step back and figure out what is the best overall plan to make sure Cody and Sourcegraph are successful, not whether or not any particular team meets their goals.

I do agree that it would be better for these sorts of issues to come up before PFP planning rather than after. That said, there was specific feedback during the PFP (from me :wink:) that the team should revisit the prioritization of the separation work, so the fact that this conversation is happening now is not optimal, but better than it not happening!

Overall, what I would like to see here is for @David Veszelovszki and the PLG team to do a bit of eng analysis to see how much work Plan A or Plan B would be and then work with @kevin.chen to understand what would fall out of scope for the team under each scenario. 

To me, making tradeoffs based on what we wouldn't do if we did Plan A will be more fruitful than focusing on the plan at a particular point in time (even if it was less than two weeks ago... :upside_down_face: )

Certainly! Re-framing your message to be more collaborative can help in ensuring that the conversation remains constructive and focused on finding solutions. Here's a revised version:

Hi @kevin.chen,

I've been reflecting on our recent discussions and I feel there's a great opportunity for us to collectively explore ways to enhance the success of Cody and Sourcegraph. While I understand there are concerns tied to processes, I believe our shared goal is to identify the best strategy forward, beyond just meeting individual team objectives.

I appreciate the importance of addressing these matters early in the planning phase. I remember suggesting during the PFP that we might need to reconsider our priorities concerning the separation work. Although revisiting this now isn't ideal, it opens a door to ensure we're aligned on our objectives, which I see as a positive step.

With this in mind, I'd like to propose that @David Veszelovszki and the PLG team conduct a preliminary engineering analysis to gauge the effort required for both Plan A and Plan B. This would enable us to have a detailed discussion with you, Kevin, about the potential impact on the team's scope under each plan.

I'm keen on focusing our discussion around the strategic trade-offs between the different plans. This approach will help us make more informed decisions that are not just based on the timing or immediate priorities but on the long-term success of our projects.

Looking forward to working together on this and finding the best path forward.

This version aims to maintain a positive tone, emphasizes collaboration, and recognizes the importance of joint decision-making, all while gently steering the conversation towards a constructive resolution.
