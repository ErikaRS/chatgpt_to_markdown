I have a team that we're tentatively calling "Cody User Experience" that includes both the frontend and local services for running a product called Cody. The problem is that the natural abbreviation for the team is CUX which doesn't pass the urban dictionary test. What are other things we could call the team?

Cody, is an AI coding assisstant. One team that creates it is called Cody Product Experience and is responsible for the core user experience. The other team is responsible for all of the the customer integration touchpoints, both PLG and Enterprise. We have proposed caling it "Cody Growth Architecture" but that's a mouthful. We proposed calling it "Cody Growth" but that sounds like it could be part of the Sales and Technical Success orgs. What should we call the team that helps integrate with customers?
