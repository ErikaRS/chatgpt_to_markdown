Let's explore a thought experiment. In the terra ignota books they have supersonic flying cars where you can get anywhere in the world in 2 hours or less.

In this world, people will jaunt around the world to meet with people at various times and then come home again. 

But within a given area, people mostly live a standard daylight synced life style.

In a world where supersonic flying cars make global travel accessible within two hours, the concept of jet lag would likely evolve due to the frequency and ease of travel. Here’s an exploration of how people might adapt to or mitigate jet lag in this context:

---

### 1. **Localized Daylight Anchoring**
   - **Behavior:** People may structure their lives around their home time zone, regardless of how often they travel globally. If they jaunt to a different time zone for a meeting or an event, they might adopt a "commuter mentality," treating it like a brief disruption rather than fully adjusting to the new time zone.
   - **Tools:** Homes and workplaces could feature lighting systems that mimic local daylight to reinforce circadian rhythms, reducing disorientation.

---

### 2. **Optimized Sleep Management**
   - **Behavior:** Sleep schedules could become more segmented and adaptive. For example, a person might plan a strategic nap on the way to or from a destination to ensure peak performance at their destination while maintaining their home rhythm.
   - **Technology:** Flying cars may be equipped with sleep pods that create optimal rest environments (darkness, white noise, temperature control) to support mid-journey naps.

---

### 3. **Biotechnological Solutions**
   - **Behavior:** People might rely on wearable devices or biohacks to help their bodies adapt quickly to shifts in time zones. For example:
     - Real-time circadian rhythm tracking.
     - Personalized light exposure therapy during flights.
   - **Technology:** Medication or supplements designed to temporarily delay or advance circadian cycles without long-term disruption could become common.

---

### 4. **Social Adaptation**
   - **Behavior:** Global etiquette might evolve to recognize "light jet lag." For instance:
     - Meetings might incorporate short breaks or power naps for travelers.
     - Social norms could accept that individuals may be slightly disoriented but still functional after jaunting across the globe.
   - **Culture:** Local "recovery hubs" might emerge at major hubs for people to recalibrate after global travel before reentering their routines.

---

### 5. **Economic and Organizational Adaptations**
   - **Behavior:** Businesses and governments might create "temporal hubs" in neutral time zones, where meetings are scheduled to overlap minimally disruptive hours for all attendees.
   - **Technology:** AI-driven scheduling tools could optimize meeting times for participants from multiple time zones, considering travel and rest cycles.

---

### 6. **Lifestyle Shifts**
   - **Behavior:** Some people might embrace polyphasic sleep patterns, splitting their sleep into shorter cycles aligned with travel demands.
   - **Technology:** Homes might feature automated systems that adapt environmental conditions to support non-linear schedules.

---

### 7. **Jet Lag as a Managed Condition**
   - **Behavior:** Jet lag might shift from a temporary inconvenience to a managed lifestyle element. This could lead to services like:
     - On-the-go micro-dosing of melatonin or cortisol regulators.
     - Professional “time coaches” who optimize travel schedules and recovery plans.
   - **Technology:** A ubiquitous global app might predict and resolve time-related disorientation using real-time biometric feedback.

---

### Reflection:
The cultural and technological solutions in such a world would make jet lag less about long-term recovery and more about real-time management. Over time, human attitudes might shift to see temporal disorientation as a normal, minor inconvenience rather than a significant challenge.

Do you want to explore deeper into how people might psychologically adapt or how societal structures might evolve around such a reality?

### Psychological Adaptations to a Supersonic Travel World

In a world where supersonic travel is commonplace and global jaunts are a regular part of life, individuals would develop unique psychological adaptations to handle the continuous and rapid shifts between time zones and environments. Here’s a deeper look at the potential changes in mental frameworks, coping mechanisms, and cognitive strategies:

---

### 1. **Temporal Fluidity**
   - **Cognitive Shift:** People might develop a more fluid perception of time. Instead of anchoring themselves strictly to a single time zone or daily rhythm, individuals could embrace a more dynamic, event-oriented structure:
     - "I sleep when it’s convenient."
     - "Work happens whenever the opportunity arises."
   - **Result:** This could reduce the psychological distress tied to rigid schedules, as people learn to focus on *outputs* and *experiences* rather than traditional notions of clock time.

---

### 2. **Resilience Against Disorientation**
   - **Adaptation:** Frequent travelers might build resilience to the cognitive effects of temporal and environmental shifts, much like how seasoned shift workers adapt over time.
     - Regular exposure to time shifts might desensitize the brain’s reaction to sudden circadian disruptions.
   - **Result:** The novelty and stress of switching time zones would diminish, leaving individuals better able to focus on their immediate tasks or interactions.

---

### 3. **Event-Centric Thinking**
   - **Cognitive Reframe:** People might adopt an "event-centric" approach to time rather than adhering to linear, clock-based thinking:
     - "I meet Sarah in Paris at 4 PM local, then have dinner at home at 7 PM local."
     - Time becomes a series of *anchor points* rather than a continuous flow.
   - **Result:** This mindset would emphasize meaningful experiences and milestones over worrying about transitions between time zones.

---

### 4. **Greater Focus on the Present**
   - **Psychological Growth:** Regular exposure to different cultures, time zones, and environments might encourage people to live more in the moment:
     - “I’m in Singapore for 3 hours—how can I make the most of this time?”
   - **Result:** This could foster mindfulness, adaptability, and a more flexible attitude toward life’s unpredictability.

---

### 5. **Evolving Social Norms and Expectations**
   - **Psychological Impact:** The global travel culture could shift societal expectations, reducing the stigma of saying, “I need a nap,” or “I’ll step away for recovery.”
   - **Result:** Reduced guilt around self-care would alleviate the psychological toll of constant travel, as recovery becomes a normalized and respected behavior.

---

### 6. **Sense of Identity and Place**
   - **Challenge:** Frequent travel might erode the traditional sense of “home” or “belonging” tied to a fixed location. This could lead to:
     - A fragmented identity where individuals feel less anchored to a single cultural or physical context.
   - **Adaptation:** To counterbalance this, people might:
     - Cultivate a stronger *internal identity* focused on personal values rather than geography.
     - Use travel as a way to build *relational roots* globally, relying on a network of friends or communities rather than a fixed “home.”

---

### 7. **Tolerance for Ambiguity**
   - **Cognitive Skill:** Regularly moving between environments, time zones, and cultures could enhance tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty:
     - Individuals might develop stronger problem-solving skills, creativity, and adaptability as they navigate constant change.
   - **Result:** This mindset would make individuals more resilient and less prone to stress in the face of unexpected disruptions.

---

### 8. **Cultural Fluidity and Empathy**
   - **Outcome:** Frequent exposure to different cultures could increase cultural empathy and understanding. Individuals might:
     - Learn to quickly adapt their behavior to align with local customs or expectations.
     - Develop a global mindset, prioritizing shared human experiences over parochial concerns.
   - **Result:** This could lead to a more interconnected and empathetic world, where individuals see themselves as global citizens.

---

### 9. **Psychological Risks and Coping Mechanisms**
   - **Risks:**
     - **Burnout:** Despite the ease of travel, constant transitions could still lead to exhaustion, especially for those unable to pace themselves.
     - **Decision Fatigue:** Rapid adjustments to new environments might strain cognitive resources.
     - **Disconnection:** Without a clear “home base,” some individuals might feel ungrounded or isolated.
   - **Coping Strategies:**
     - **Intentional Recovery:** Emphasizing downtime and self-care between trips.
     - **Personal Rituals:** Establishing routines that provide a sense of normalcy (e.g., meditating in the same way regardless of location).
     - **Digital Anchors:** Using technology to maintain a sense of continuity, such as virtual gatherings with loved ones or consistent journaling practices.

---

### 10. **Revised Perception of Achievement**
   - **Shift in Priorities:** People might redefine success to prioritize experiences and connections over traditional markers of achievement:
     - "I spent time with a colleague in Tokyo, sealed the deal, and was home for my daughter’s recital."
   - **Result:** This approach would balance personal fulfillment with professional success, reducing the stress of feeling “spread too thin.”

---

### Final Thoughts:
In this world, individuals would likely embrace psychological flexibility as a core skill, supported by societal norms that respect and normalize the need for balance and recovery. Relationships, personal values, and mindfulness would play crucial roles in grounding individuals amidst a high-speed, globally connected lifestyle.
