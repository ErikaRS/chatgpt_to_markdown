Your goal is to compute the sum of 4 numbers. First, start by describing how you would verify that one number s, is the sum of four other numbers, n1, n2, n3, n4

Sure, to verify if a number 's' is the sum of four other numbers n1, n2, n3, and n4, you would follow these steps:

1. **Add the four numbers together**: The first step in this process would be to perform the operation n1 + n2 + n3 + n4. This will provide you with a result, let's call it 'result'. 

2. **Compare the result to 's'**: Now that you have your 'result' from adding the four numbers together, you can compare it with 's'. This is done by checking if 'result' is equal to 's'. 

    If 'result' is equal to 's', then 's' is indeed the sum of n1, n2, n3, and n4.
    
    If 'result' is not equal to 's', then 's' is not the sum of n1, n2, n3, and n4.

Here is an example:

Suppose you have n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n3 = 3, n4 = 4, and s = 10.

You would start by adding n1, n2, n3, and n4 together:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 (this is our 'result')

Then you would compare 'result' to 's'. In this case, 10 is equal to 10, so we can conclude that 's' is indeed the sum of n1, n2, n3, and n4.

The process could also be done with variables and general algebraic expressions.

How would you do it without using addition? 

### Assistant - 2023-06-15 13:14:01

If you're not allowed to use addition directly, you could verify that a number 's' is the sum of four other numbers n1, n2, n3, and n4 by using a subtractive process. 

Here are the steps:

1. **Subtract each of the four numbers from 's'**: Subtract n1 from 's', then subtract n2 from the result, then n3, and finally n4. You can represent this as: 

    result = s - n1 - n2 - n3 - n4

2. **Check if the result is zero**: If 's' is indeed the sum of n1, n2, n3, and n4, then the result of the operation above should be 0. If the result is not 0, then 's' is not the sum of the four numbers.

So to rephrase the original problem in terms of subtraction:

'S' is the sum of n1, n2, n3, and n4 if and only if s - n1 - n2 - n3 - n4 = 0.

For example, if we have n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n3 = 3, n4 = 4, and s = 10:

We would start by subtracting n1, n2, n3, and n4 from 's':

10 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 = 0

Since the result is 0, we can conclude that 's' is indeed the sum of n1, n2, n3, and n4.

This approach effectively accomplishes the same thing as adding the numbers and comparing to 's', but it uses only subtraction instead of addition.

Computer and verify the sum of 22, 91, 3, 100

### Assistant - 2023-06-15 13:14:30

Sure, if you're asking for the sum of these four numbers (22, 91, 3, 100), you can perform the operation:

22 + 91 + 3 + 100 = 216

Therefore, the sum of the numbers 22, 91, 3, and 100 is 216. 

If you wanted to verify this sum using the subtractive method discussed before, you would take the sum (216) and subtract each of the original numbers:

216 - 22 - 91 - 3 - 100 = 0

Since the result is zero, we can conclude that 216 is indeed the sum of 22, 91, 3, and 100.

Show the intermediate steps of the addition and the subtraction

### Assistant - 2023-06-15 13:15:09

Sure, I'll break it down into more detailed steps:

**Addition:**

Step 1: Start with the first number:

   22

Step 2: Add the second number:

   22
 + 91
 ----
  113

Step 3: Add the third number:

   113
 + 3
 ----
  116

Step 4: Add the fourth number:

   116
 + 100
 -----
  216

So, 22 + 91 + 3 + 100 = 216.

**Subtraction:**

Step 1: Start with the sum:

   216

Step 2: Subtract the first number:

   216
 - 22
 ----
  194

Step 3: Subtract the second number:

   194
 - 91
 ----
  103

Step 4: Subtract the third number:

   103
 - 3
 ----
  100

Step 5: Subtract the fourth number:

   100
 - 100
 ----
  0

So, 216 - 22 - 91 - 3 - 100 = 0, confirming that 216 is the sum of 22, 91, 3, and 100.
