I'm going to start by pasting in some raw context information. For now, just take in the info.

### Assistant - 2024-02-02 08:07:32

Sure, go ahead and paste the context information. I'm ready to take it in.

Proposal: May planning & shuffle update
Instead of announcing Steve’s role change on Feb 13th, we accelerate the timeline and do so next week.

The reason we initially wanted to wait is that we did not want to disrupt planning or the launch. However, with an update to the company strategy coming out, Quinn and I feel like it makes sense to get the changes announced ahead of planning. 

However, that does not mean that we’re going to throw planning away. Instead, we’ll ask the teams to focus on:
What are the clear next steps for now
What are they starting to see as themes for the annual direction and vision for the teams (but Merge is where we will lock this in)

Since the teams generally have clear next steps, this will allow us to give teams good feedback so they aren’t blocked for the next 4 weeks. It will also be good practice for thinking about eng planning more incrementally.

What do we need to do to decide?
Align with Lauren and Madison on whether to move up the shuffle announcement
This will requiring updating the schedule and making sure all of the remaining loose ends on things like comms plan and org structure are cleaned up
Make sure ABC (and Raman) are aligned with this, although they are more impacted by the “longer term” decisions part of this
Make sure Chris Sells is aligned on making this change to the reviews next week
Note that we don’t need full alignment on whether or not to move to more continuous planning vs quarterly planning to unblock next week. Because we know we need to revisit annual plans once the strategy is updated, treating next week’s planning as more incremental makes sense whatever we do after. 

Assume we go with this plan, things that need to get done:
Inform everyone in the shuffle slack channel that the timeline for announcing the shuffle is being moved up
Update the shuffle timeline and make sure the comms are complete (Eng Restructure Comms Plan - February 2024)
Chris, Erika, and Kalan align on the changed scope for planning
Run messaging for that by Quinn and Madison to make sure that we’re communicating about the strategy consistently
Announce the planning scope change to the team. This should probably be Chris or Erika since it’s a fairly disruptive change and we need to take ownership of it as leaders.
Announce the shuffle following the comms plan

Longer term decisions
How do we move to more continuous planning? What does that mean for things like customer facing roadmaps and marketing launches? 
How do we set up incentives for our teams to build quality engineering work while still delivering a regular conveyor belt of value? 

On the longer term bits, Erika Rice Scherpelz would like to see something like this:
We have a clear annual vision and direction at the product level
We have quarterly PFP checkins that focus on:
Retrospective review since last time (including things like metrics updates)
Updates to the annual direction
Teams sharing their most important next steps that they plan to work on next. It's okay if those things don't fill up the whole quarter. It's also okay if some take longer than a quarter (although we still want to identify value add milestones along the way)
Marketing has events at the cadence that makes sense for them and we have an agreement that they need firm commitments X weeks before the event
The customer roadmap focuses on the annual scope goals and the next step work. Only the next step work has dates associated with it, and it's target dates, not hard commitments
A couple of notes:
On the PFP checkin review side, the only real difference is that we're asking teams to focus on what's next on their plate, not boxing to a quarter. The larger changes are on the roadmap and marketing event side.
This plan is dependent on moving to quarterly code search releases since part of the structural pressure to plan in 3 month increments is that if you miss the boat on the next release, then it's 3 months before your feature can get in front of users. That creates launch pressure even if there's no marketing or customer outreach to worry about.

Thank you for sharing this detailed proposal. It seems to be focused on organizational changes, specifically around planning processes, role changes, and communication strategies. If you have any specific questions or need assistance with aspects of this proposal, please let me know how I can help.

### User - 2024-02-02 08:08:20

Thanks for the additional detail here. I do think that if we get better annual level vision and direction (which is the plan!) then we can move to the detailed eng planning being a bit more incremental.
I'll let the two of you talk about it, but the world I'd love to more toward is:
We have a clear annual vision and direction at the product level
We have quarterly PFP checkins that focus on:
Retrospective review since last time (including things like metrics updates)
Updates to the annual direction
Teams sharing their most important next steps that they plan to work on next. It's okay if those things don't fill up the whole quarter. It's also okay if some take longer than a quarter (although we still want to identify value add milestones along the way)
Marketing has events at the cadence that makes sense for them and we have an agreement that they need firm commitments X weeks before the event

Do we have a #discuss-process Slack channel anywhere?
I would love to talk through a few ideas/thoughts about improving processes overall. For example, right now doing both PFP and working towards critical things for release (esp. as an IC) is tricky.
I would love for us to actually take a week (so condense it even) to dedicate to planning once the release is actually done and our heads are a little clearer.
It also gives us the chance to sync and collab a lot closer when we're not all distracted, which I'm sure 
@Erika Rice Scherpelz
 and 
@csells
 would appreciate as getting people prioritising planning in this period is tricky! (edited) 

+1. The current PFP timing reminds me of when we had performance reviews taking place in the leading weeks towards a big launch.

Oh yeah, totally +1.
I (as PLG TL) just told 
@kevin.chen
 (as PLG PM) that I’d had almost no time (about 1h total) to review our May goals pitch deck, and we’d be committing to them next Thurdsday (which happens to be the day of our delayed pre-release milestone :grimacing:).
Definitely not easy to find focus for the major context change to strategic thinking while in the crunch to make the deadline.

It sounds like you're proposing a few key changes to your organizational processes:

1. **Creation of a #discuss-process Slack Channel**: This would be a dedicated space for discussing and brainstorming improvements in processes, particularly around planning and release cycles. It's a great idea as it fosters open communication and collaborative problem-solving among team members.

2. **Dedicated Planning Week Post-Release**: Allocating a specific week for planning immediately after a release can help clear up any distractions and enable team members to focus solely on planning. This approach could lead to more effective and thoughtful planning, as team members would not be divided between planning and other critical tasks.

3. **Synchronization and Collaboration Enhancement**: By having a dedicated planning period, it allows for more effective synchronization and collaboration among team members. This seems especially important in your context, where getting people to prioritize planning amidst other responsibilities is challenging.

4. **Adjusting PFP Timing**: Your suggestion indicates that the current timing for the Performance and Feedback Process (PFP) is not optimal, especially when it coincides with the lead-up to major releases. Adjusting the timing of these reviews to avoid overlapping with critical project phases could reduce stress and improve focus on both tasks.

It's clear that you are advocating for a more streamlined, focused approach to planning and strategic thinking, one that accounts for the workload and context of the team members. This seems especially pertinent in an environment where the strategic planning phase often coincides with critical operational phases, leading to divided attention and potential burnout. 

Creating a dedicated Slack channel would be a good first step in discussing these ideas further with your colleagues and finding consensus on the best way forward.

I'd like to condense the proposal (the first two inputs) into a response to the third input. It should be 3-5 sentences and make clear why the change is important. 

### Assistant - 2024-02-02 08:13:23

Certainly! Here's a condensed response that addresses the concerns raised in the third input, while incorporating the key points from the initial proposal:

"In response to the challenges highlighted in planning during critical release periods, we're proposing accelerated changes in our organizational process. By aligning the announcement of role changes and the company strategy update ahead of our planning cycle, we aim to provide clearer direction and reduce disruptions. This shift towards more incremental, focused planning post-release allows for better strategic alignment and a clearer headspace for all team members. This approach, emphasizing a clear annual vision with flexible quarterly check-ins, is crucial for balancing immediate operational needs with long-term strategic goals, ensuring we don’t compromise on either front."
