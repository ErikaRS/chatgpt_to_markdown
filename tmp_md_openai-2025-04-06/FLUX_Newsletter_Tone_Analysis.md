The FLUX Review has a tone that is reflective, thought-provoking, and geared toward deep systems thinking. It tends to focus on patterns, relationships, and emergent phenomena in complex systems, inviting readers to challenge conventional perspectives and think critically about the interconnected nature of societal, technological, and organizational dynamics.

What sets FLUX apart from other newsletters is its focus on applying systems theory to a broad range of topics, offering multidisciplinary insights that transcend traditional silos. Rather than just reporting on trends or providing surface-level analysis, FLUX dives into the underlying dynamics that drive change, encouraging readers to engage with the content in a way that fosters deeper understanding and fresh perspectives. It emphasizes synthesis over summary, helping readers not only see the "what" but also understand the "why" behind patterns of transformation.

Given that description, revise this essay to be more concise and more FLUXy. Do this while keeping as much of the substance and as much of the original phrasing as possible. Consider compressing the initial critique to focus more on the differentiated aspect of how to redeem founder mode.

Founder Mode is the idea du jour in the tech world. On the surface, it is a vague but seductive inkblot. It invites leaders to indulge fears that their reports are secretly "professional fakers" who have been covering up their failures by “managing up” for years? But if we dig a bit deeper, perhaps we can find a version of founder mode that is robust.

The seductive version of founder mode suggests that one can fix a systemic problem with sufficient heroism. Founders have unique insight and authority which allow them to fix things. This type of founder mode, in so far as it works, gets legitimacy from the Weberian charismatic authority of the founder. 

Often it doesn’t work. It can become a thin excuse for micromanagement, a paean to the Great Man school of history. And when founder mode is a veneer over micromanagement, trying to scale will create a whole organization of micromanagers. 

As Paul Graham alludes to in his final footnote, you need mechanisms to prevent founder mode from becoming founder syndrome. This requires hiring people who can outperform the founder on the things the leader can’t (or doesn’t want) to do. As Steve Jobs points out, these truly gifted people don’t want to work for micromanagers. 

Yet there is something there in the concept of founder mode. It does seem like founders have some sort of comparative advantage. And the need for decisive leadership in the post ZIRP era of seemingly endless growth shows that it’s not true that CEOs don’t steer. 

At its best, founder mode can be a way to build a culture that cuts through the thermocline of truth. So instead of looking at founder mode through the lens of who you are, we can look at it through the lens of what effective founders do. How do they intervene in systems to achieve success? And how do they turn this into a set of techniques and cultural touchstones that can be recursively used by others as the organization grows? 

The founder mindset knows the value of diving deep. They know the importance of understanding what’s going on behind the status report and not being satisfied with superficial overviews. They also know that deep understanding and corrective feedback is different than needing to call all the shots. One way to do dive deep is to go to the gemba. This can range from actual 'gemba walks' to building a culture where all leaders are expected to regularly have skip-level 1:1s. One effective aspect of Brian Chesky's embrace of founder mode was imposing a system of reviews after several years of letting things drift.

The founder mindset knows the value of psychological safety. Although sometimes erroneously associated with low standards and coddling people, at its core, psychological safety at its core is about building a culture where people feel they can take risks. The test is to ask "did the last person who gave me bad news regret it?" If you don't know or don't care then you, as a leader, have failed. As Michael Carey puts it "if you kill the messenger, you just get less mail."

The founder mindset knows they need to scale themselves, not become the bottleneck. One of the motivations for founder mode is that founders feel pushed to compromise on their vision to do things the “right” way. To hold to this vision effectively requires figuring out how to replicate it virally. Leaders who try to be true to a vision by holding it tightly, who operate like the Eye of Sauron, eventually discover that they’ve disempowered their people. Consequently everything they're not currently watching fails. Instead you have to train and empower your people so that they eventually exceed your capabilities while remaining true to your vision. 

A good leader acts as a floor, not a ceiling. They understand that they need to find people who are better than they are at key needs and then give them both autonomy and a strong feedback mechanism to make sure that they are delivering on the founder’s vision. This is why the best sports teams are run by people who know that they can't be on the pitch at the critical juncture but must find ways to decentralize command so that someone else can make good decisions about when to pass and when to shoot.

We recommend escaping the false dichotomy between founder mode and manager mode. Instead, accept that even Steve Jobs said "we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do". Your role as a leader is to define a direction with clarity and then build systems that get the best out of your people so you can get there together.

**Redeeming Founder Mode: Scaling Leadership for Systemic Success**

Founder Mode, a popular yet vague concept in tech, often risks being reduced to a seductive inkblot. It invites fears of "professional fakers" managing up while allowing founders to believe that heroic intervention alone can fix systemic issues. But there’s a more robust version of Founder Mode, one that avoids the pitfalls of micromanagement and builds a scalable, resilient organization.

At its worst, Founder Mode leans on charismatic authority, echoing the Great Man theory—dangerously creating a culture of micromanagers when scaled. To avoid this, Paul Graham’s insights remind us that preventing Founder Syndrome requires hiring people who outperform the founder in key areas. As Steve Jobs noted, top talent resists micromanagement.

Yet, Founder Mode has value. In the post-ZIRP era, where leadership matters more than ever, founders offer a comparative advantage. Effective founders don’t just steer—they build cultures that cut through organizational noise and surface truth.

To redeem Founder Mode, we need to shift the lens: Instead of focusing on *who* founders are, we should look at *what* they do. Successful founders intervene strategically, creating techniques and cultural norms that scale. They understand the importance of diving deep—not to control, but to clarify and empower.

Founders know the power of understanding what’s happening beneath the surface. They embrace psychological safety—not to lower standards, but to ensure people can take risks and share uncomfortable truths. The test is simple: "Did the last person who gave me bad news regret it?" If so, leadership has failed.

Moreover, founders must scale themselves, not become bottlenecks. Holding vision tightly risks disempowering the team; instead, they must replicate it through others. Leaders acting like the Eye of Sauron—hovering over every detail—find that what they don’t watch falls apart. Empowerment means decentralizing command and enabling others to uphold the vision.

Great leaders act as floors, not ceilings. They hire people better than themselves in key areas and give them both autonomy and feedback to deliver on the vision. The best teams aren’t led by those who micromanage every play but by those who create systems where others can make critical decisions effectively.

Escaping the false dichotomy between Founder Mode and Manager Mode requires understanding Steve Jobs’ advice: "We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do." The role of leadership is not to control but to define a clear direction and build systems that get the best from the team, driving collective success.

This revision retains the core arguments but distills them through a systems-thinking lens, with an emphasis on scaling culture, empowering teams, and balancing leadership vision with decentralized execution. It aligns with FLUX's focus on actionable, structural thinking.

Copy edit this for conciseness while keeping it as much the same as possible. 

Founder Mode is the idea du jour in the tech world. As all the discussion around it shows, it is vague enough to become an inkblot for our fears and desires. But if we dig a bit deeper, perhaps we can find a version of founder mode that is robust.

The seductive version of founder mode leans on charismatic authority and heroism, echoing the Great Man theory of history. It feeds fears that “professional fakers” have been covering up their failures for years. Founder mode can become a thin excuse for micromanagement. And this doesn’t scale. As Graham’s essay observes, founders need to avoid founder syndrome, where they are unable to delegate anything. And, as Steve Jobs points out, truly gifted people don’t want to work for micromanagers. 

Yes something about founder mode resonates. In the post-ZIRP era, we can no longer say that CEOs don’t steer. Leadership matters more than ever, and founders can offer a comparative advantage. The founder mindset can build a culture that cuts through the thermocline of truth. So instead of looking at founder mode through the lens of who is at the helm, we can look at it through the lens of what effective founders do to intervene strategically, creating techniques and cultural norms that scale. 

Dive deep: The founder mindset digs for the substance behind the status report and is not satisfied with superficial overviews. They proactively provide corrective feedback. And they know that doing these things is different than trying to call all the shot. One way to dive deep is to go to the gemba, literally or through expectations such as all leaders regularly having skip-level 1:1s. Brian Chesky's embrace of founder mode included imposing a system of reviews.

Foster psychological safety: Although sometimes erroneously associated with low standards and coddling people, psychological safety is about building a culture where people can take risks. The test is to ask "did the last person who gave me bad news regret it?" If you don't know (or don't care) then people are going to optimize for keeping you happy instead of achieving ambitious goals. As Michael Carey puts it "if you kill the messenger, you just get less mail."

Scale your vision: Founders need to scale themselves, not become the bottleneck. Graham is right when he points to the harm of founders succumbing to generic leadership advice. However, the solution is not to holds the vision tightly, operating like the Eye of Sauron and disempowering people. In this world, anything the founder is not watching fails. Scaling the founder’s vision requires figuring out how to replicate it virally. You have to train and empower people so that they eventually exceed your capabilities while remaining true to your vision. 

A good leader acts as a floor, not a ceiling. They understand that they need to find people who are better than themselves in key areas and give them both autonomy to innovate and strong feedback to keep them aligned to the vision. This is why the best sports teams are run by people who know that they can't be on the pitch at the critical juncture but must find ways to decentralize command so that someone else can make good decisions about when to pass and when to shoot.

We recommend escaping the false dichotomy between founder mode and manager mode. Instead, accept that even Steve Jobs said "we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do". Your role as a leader is to define a direction with clarity and then build systems that get the best out of your people so you can get there together.

Here’s a more concise version of your text while maintaining its original intent and phrasing as much as possible:

**Founder Mode** is the tech world's idea du jour, vague enough to mirror fears and desires. Yet, digging deeper, we might find a more robust version of it.

The seductive take leans on charismatic authority and heroism, echoing the Great Man theory. It feeds fears of “professional fakers” covering failures and can easily turn into an excuse for micromanagement—which doesn't scale. As Graham notes, founders must avoid Founder Syndrome, where they can't delegate. Steve Jobs observed that top talent won’t work for micromanagers.

Still, Founder Mode has value. In the post-ZIRP era, where leadership is essential, founders can offer a comparative advantage. The founder mindset can cut through the “thermocline of truth,” focusing less on who leads and more on what effective founders do: intervening strategically and creating scalable techniques and norms.

**Dive deep:** Founders dig past the status report, providing corrective feedback without trying to control everything. One way is to visit the gemba or hold skip-level 1:1s. Brian Chesky embraced this by implementing regular reviews.

**Foster psychological safety:** Often misunderstood as coddling, psychological safety is about encouraging risk-taking. Ask, "Did the last person who gave me bad news regret it?" If yes (or you don’t know), people will prioritize keeping you happy over ambitious goals. As Michael Carey says, “If you kill the messenger, you just get less mail.”

**Scale your vision:** Founders need to scale themselves, not become bottlenecks. Holding the vision too tightly disempowers the team. Instead of acting like the Eye of Sauron, founders must replicate their vision by empowering others to eventually exceed their capabilities while staying true to the vision.

A good leader is a floor, not a ceiling. They hire people better than themselves, giving them autonomy to innovate and feedback to stay aligned with the vision. The best teams decentralize command, allowing others to make critical decisions.

Escape the false dichotomy between Founder Mode and Manager Mode. Even Steve Jobs said, "We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do." Leadership is about defining direction and building systems that get the best from the team.

If "idea du jour" is idea of the day, what would be "idea of last week"

If "idea du jour" means "idea of the day," the phrase for "idea of last week" could be **"idée de la semaine dernière"** in French, which translates directly to "idea of last week."

Alternatively, to maintain a similar tone to "du jour" while indicating something a bit outdated, you might playfully say **"idée d'hier"** ("idea of yesterday") or **"idée de la semaine passée"** ("idea of the past week"). Both imply something slightly more passé than "du jour."
