Remind me what covariant and contravariant mean in the context of programming languages

In the context of programming languages, "covariant" and "contravariant" refer to how types behave in relation to their subtyping, especially in generic programming and type hierarchies. These concepts are particularly relevant in languages that support object-oriented programming and generics.

1. **Covariant**: This term is used when a type system preserves the ordering of types, going from more specific to more general. In practical terms, if `Type B` is a subtype of `Type A`, then `Container<Type B>` is considered a subtype of `Container<Type A>`. This is common in return types. For example, if a method in a superclass returns `Type A`, a method in a subclass can return `Type B` if `B` is a subtype of `A`.

2. **Contravariant**: This is the opposite of covariance. Here, the type system reverses the ordering. If `Type B` is a subtype of `Type A`, then `Container<Type A>` is considered a subtype of `Container<Type B>`. Contravariance is often seen in parameter types. For example, if a method in a superclass takes a parameter of `Type A`, a method in a subclass could take a parameter of `Type B` if `B` is a supertype of `A`.

These concepts are crucial for ensuring type safety in inheritance hierarchies and when dealing with generics. They help in designing robust and flexible APIs that can handle a variety of data types while maintaining the integrity of the type system.
