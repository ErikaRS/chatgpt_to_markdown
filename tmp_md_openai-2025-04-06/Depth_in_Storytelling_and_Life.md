The Unseen World: Why Depth Matters in Writing—and in Life
In the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien or even children’s shows like Bluey, there’s a remarkable quality that often goes unnoticed by casual readers or viewers. Both creators offer stories with a richness that feels infinitely more expansive than what’s on the surface. Tolkien’s Middle-earth, with its vast histories, languages, and cultures, seems to stretch out far beyond the pages of The Lord of the Rings. Similarly, Bluey is not just a simple show about a family of anthropomorphic dogs—its emotional depth, social dynamics, and unsaid truths create a layered world that resonates with both children and adults.

This "rich world behind the story" is what sets these works apart. It’s what gives them coherence, a sense of cause and effect, a feeling of gravity and meaning. There is a structure and logic beneath the surface, even if it's not always explicitly presented.

But what if we think of this idea as more than just a hallmark of great storytelling? What if we extend this metaphor to the way we live and the coherence of our own actions and beliefs?

The Visible vs. the Invisible
Just as a great novel or show has a world behind it that lends depth, our actions and beliefs, when they are supported by a deeper set of values and experiences, carry a similar weight. We often judge people or ourselves based on what’s visible: the things we say, the actions we take, or the decisions we make. Yet, the richness comes from what’s unseen—our internal worldview, the "mythology" of our lives, and the coherence of our beliefs.

In systems thinking, this idea is not far from the concept of root causes or mental models. The actions we take (the visible surface) are often driven by mental frameworks that are deeply held but unexpressed (the world behind the action). These underlying structures give our actions coherence over time. When these deeper layers align with our behavior, the result is a sense of meaning and consistency in our lives, just as an unseen world gives a story its meaning and depth.

Building a Coherent World for Yourself
Imagine for a moment that your life’s actions are like the visible chapters of a book, but the real story lies in the notes, drafts, and appendices you never show. When we act without a deeper sense of alignment, our lives can feel fragmented, disjointed—like a series of disconnected events. But when we cultivate an internal world rich with values, beliefs, and purpose, our actions gain coherence and meaning.

In Tolkien’s work, there’s a history behind every object, a backstory for every character, and a deeper cultural context for every conflict. Similarly, the decisions we make today might seem like small choices, but when they’re informed by a larger vision or philosophy of life, they resonate on a deeper level. The way we approach a conflict, choose a career, or treat others can all be reflections of a more extensive internal narrative.

The Consequence of a Shallow World
On the flip side, when we act without an internal "world" behind our choices—when our actions are purely reactive or unanchored—we lose that richness. Our choices may appear random, lacking in purpose, much like a story that jumps from event to event without any connective tissue. We become like characters in a shallow novel, whose actions seem arbitrary, without deeper meaning or consequence.

This is particularly evident in organizations that fail to articulate a clear mission or set of values. Actions become disjointed, policies seem random, and long-term coherence is lost. Just as a poorly built fictional world leaves a story hollow, an organization or individual without an underlying belief system feels similarly shallow.

Cultivating Your World
So how do we build this unseen world behind our actions? It starts with self-reflection, understanding the beliefs, values, and experiences that shape who we are and why we make the choices we do. This isn’t about creating a rigid set of rules, but rather about cultivating an evolving, adaptive internal landscape that can guide us through the complexities of life.

Like Tolkien’s deep lore, our inner world doesn’t have to be fully visible to others for it to be effective. It’s not about broadcasting every belief or explaining every motivation; it’s about having that sense of depth within ourselves, so that when we act, our choices carry the weight of something larger than the moment. There is a cause and effect, a meaning behind even the smallest decision.

Conclusion: Living with Coherence
In great stories, the richness often lies in the world behind the scenes. And so it is in life. When our actions are supported by a deeper coherence, an unseen structure of beliefs and experiences, they carry a sense of meaning that resonates beyond the immediate. We may not always be aware of it, but others can feel it. Like a well-built fictional world, our lives become richer, fuller, and more meaningful when they are grounded in a deep internal landscape.

In the end, living with this internal coherence allows us to not only navigate the complexities of life more effectively but to do so with a sense of purpose, alignment, and richness that others—consciously or unconsciously—can recognize and respect.

Yet, the richness comes from what’s unseen—our internal worldview and the coherence of our beliefs.\n\nIf your life’s actions are like the visible chapters of a book, then your values and beliefs provide the real story beneath. The decisions we make today might seem small, but when informed by a larger vision, they resonate on a deeper level.\n\nWhen we act without alignment, our lives can feel fragmented. Our choices may appear random, much like a story that jumps from event to event without any connective tissue.\n\nSo how do we deepen this unseen world? It starts with self-reflection—understanding the beliefs and values that shape who we are. This echoes virtue ethics: cultivating an evolving, adaptive internal landscape to guide us through the complexities of life.\n\nApplying this idea to organizations, fragmentation can become extreme without coherence. Organizations that fail to articulate a clear mission, values, or principles become disjointed. Policies seem random, and long-term coherence is lost. An organization is less like a novel and more like a TV show with multiple writers. Without a shared sense of purpose, the final product feels fragmented, lacking clear themes.\n\nOrganizations can increase coherence by defining their mission, core values, and principles, and embedding these in everyday actions. Leaders must model these values, creating alignment across teams. Shared rituals, stories, and open communication help reinforce a collective understanding. Just as a well-planned TV series maintains cohesion, an organization can achieve coherence through a strong, shared foundation.\n\nIn great stories, the richness often lies in the world behind the scenes. And so it is in life. When our actions are supported by deeper coherence—an unseen structure of beliefs—they carry a sense of meaning. Living with this internal coherence allows us to navigate life’s complexities with purpose and alignment that others can recognize and respect."

I've streamlined the text by removing redundancies while maintaining the overall structure and tone, reducing the length by about a third. Let me know if this works for you or if further adjustments are needed.

Work in the idea of "lore" as a name for this richer background info.
