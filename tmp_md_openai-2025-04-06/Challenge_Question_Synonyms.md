What is the name for a sometimes nosy, sometimes uncomfortable question that is meant to get people to think about a critical or challenging or important aspect of a decision they are making? I call them challenge questions, but I've never seen if there's a more common term.

The term "challenge question" is fitting, but there are other terms or phrases that capture this concept depending on the context. Here are a few:

1. **Devil's Advocate Question**: This term refers to a question posed to challenge assumptions or explore potential flaws in reasoning or decisions.

2. **Critical Inquiry**: These are questions designed to probe deeper into the reasoning or implications of a decision.

3. **Thought-Provoking Question**: A broad term for questions that encourage reflection or re-evaluation of beliefs or plans.

4. **Reflective Question**: Aimed at encouraging introspection or careful consideration of underlying factors or potential outcomes.

5. **Catalytic Question**: Often used in coaching or facilitation, these are questions that provoke insight, creativity, or a shift in thinking.

6. **Provocative Question**: Designed to push boundaries and challenge the status quo in a way that may feel slightly uncomfortable but is constructive.

7. **Strategic Question**: Focused on uncovering potential risks, opportunities, or consequences in the context of planning or decision-making.
