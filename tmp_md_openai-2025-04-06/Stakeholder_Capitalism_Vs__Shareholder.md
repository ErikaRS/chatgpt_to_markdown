Standard modern capitalism says that the purpose of business is to deliver value to the shareholders. What is the alternative philosophy called where it's about delivering value to all stakeholders, including but not limited to shareholders?

The alternative philosophy to standard modern capitalism, which focuses on delivering value to all stakeholders and not just shareholders, is called "stakeholder capitalism." This approach considers the interests of all parties involved with the business—including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the environment—beyond just the shareholders. Stakeholder capitalism emphasizes a broader responsibility of corporations to contribute positively to society and to address the needs and well-being of these various groups, creating value in a more balanced and inclusive way.

Stakeholder capitalism feels more aligned with traditional capitalism before the second half of the twentieth century. What caused the shift? What are the pros and cons of each perspective?

The shift from a broader stakeholder approach to a focus on shareholder primacy in capitalism, particularly prominent since the late 20th century, can be attributed to several factors:

1. **The Influence of Economic Theories**: The rise of shareholder primacy is heavily influenced by the economic theories of Milton Friedman and others in the 1970s. Friedman famously argued that the sole responsibility of business is to increase its profits, contending that businesses serve society best by focusing narrowly on shareholders.

2. **Regulatory and Policy Changes**: Deregulation and changes in corporate governance practices in the 1980s and 1990s in countries like the United States encouraged businesses to prioritize shareholder returns, often at the expense of other stakeholders.

3. **Globalization and Market Pressures**: As markets became more global and competitive, companies faced increased pressure to deliver short-term results to satisfy shareholders, often sidelining the interests of other stakeholders.

4. **Financial Market Development**: The development of more sophisticated financial markets and instruments also supported a focus on increasing shareholder value as the primary measure of a company's success.

### Pros and Cons of Each Perspective

**Shareholder Capitalism:**

- **Pros**:
  - **Efficiency and Innovation**: Focuses companies on maximizing profits, potentially driving efficiency and innovation.
  - **Clarity of Purpose**: Provides a clear, measurable objective (shareholder returns) that can guide corporate decisions.
  - **Investment Incentives**: Attracts investment by promising returns, which can fuel economic growth.

- **Cons**:
  - **Short-termism**: Can lead to a focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainability.
  - **Externalities**: May encourage companies to ignore negative externalities such as environmental damage or social inequality.
  - **Reduced Employee Morale**: Focusing solely on shareholder profits can demotivate employees and undermine corporate culture.

**Stakeholder Capitalism:**

- **Pros**:
  - **Sustainability**: Encourages more sustainable business practices by considering long-term impacts on all stakeholders.
  - **Community and Social Benefits**: Can lead to improved relations with communities and better social outcomes.
  - **Employee Loyalty and Satisfaction**: Potentially increases employee morale and loyalty by valuing their contributions and well-being.

- **Cons**:
  - **Complexity in Decision-Making**: Balancing the interests of multiple stakeholders can complicate decision-making processes.
  - **Potential for Diluted Focus**: Trying to meet the needs of all stakeholders may dilute a company’s focus on profitability, possibly affecting competitiveness.
  - **Measurement Challenges**: Success can be harder to measure when multiple stakeholder interests are considered, as opposed to clear financial metrics.

The debate between shareholder and stakeholder capitalism continues as societies and economies evolve, each with different emphases based on prevailing economic conditions, cultural attitudes, and regulatory environments.

Who are modern advocates for stakeholder capitalism? Especially for a very grounded, quantitative version of it?

### Assistant - 2024-05-13 18:44:54

Several modern advocates for stakeholder capitalism, particularly those who support a more grounded and quantitative approach, stand out in the current discourse:

1. **Klaus Schwab**: Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, Schwab has been a vocal proponent of stakeholder capitalism. He argues that businesses should serve all stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the broader society. The World Economic Forum has been instrumental in pushing for metrics that quantify the impact of stakeholder capitalism.

2. **Marc Benioff**: The CEO of Salesforce is well-known for his advocacy of a more inclusive capitalism that benefits all stakeholders. He has implemented this philosophy within Salesforce, prioritizing social responsibility and employee satisfaction alongside profitability.

3. **Larry Fink**: As the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Fink has significant influence over corporate governance. He annually writes letters to CEOs of major companies, urging them to focus on sustainability and long-term value creation for all stakeholders. His push includes calls for clear reporting on how companies serve a broader array of stakeholders.

4. **Joseph Bower and Lynn Paine**: These Harvard Business School professors have argued in favor of what they call "long-termism" in managing businesses, which aligns closely with stakeholder capitalism. They emphasize that companies should be managed for the long-term welfare of all stakeholders, not just for short-term shareholder returns.

5. **Anne Simpson**: As a leader in investment and governance at CalPERS (California Public Employees' Retirement System), Simpson has been a strong advocate for sustainable investment practices that consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors as integral to assessing a company’s performance and long-term value.

These leaders and thinkers advocate for a model of capitalism that demands robust, quantifiable methods to measure how companies impact their employees, communities, and the environment, alongside their financial performance. They argue that this broader approach not only is more ethical but also can lead to better long-term economic outcomes.
