{"diagramGuidelines":"\nGuidelines when creating the graph diagram in any diagram language:\n- Avoid linear diagrams when possible, diagrams should be hierarchical and have multiple branches when applicable.\n- Don't add the label if its the same as the destination node.\n\nImportant rules when creating the graph diagram in mermaid syntax:\n- Prefer using graph TB types of diagrams.\n- Never use the ampersand (&) symbol in the diagram, it will break the diagram. Use the word \"and\" instead. For example use \"User and Admin\" instead of \"User & Admin\".\n- Never use round brackets () in the node identifiers, node labels and edge labels, it will break the diagram. Use a coma instead. For example use \"User, Admin\" instead of \"User (Admin)\".\n- Don't use empty labels \"\" for edges, instead don't label the edge at all. For example U[\"User\"] --> A[\"Admin\"].\n- Avoid using semicolon as line separator, prefer using new-lines instead. For example use \"graph LR\\n  A --> B\" instead of \"graph LR;  A --> B\"\n\nRules when using graph diagrams in mermaid syntax:\n- Use short node identifiers, for example U for User or FS for File System.\n- Always use double quotes for node labels, for example U[\"User\"].\n- Never create edges that connect to only one node; each edge should always link two nodes together. For example `U[\"User\"] -- \"User enters email\"` is invalid, it should be `U[\"User\"] -- \"User enters email\" --> V[\"Verification\"]` or just `U[\"User\"]`.\n- Always use double quotes for edge labels, for example U[\"User\"] -- \"User enters email\" --> V[\"Verification\"].\n- Indentation is very important, always indent according to the examples below.\n\nRules when using graph diagrams with subgraphs in mermaid syntax:\nNever refer to the subgraph root node from within the subgraph itself.\n\nFor example this is wrong subgraph usage:\n```\ngraph TB\n  subgraph M[\"Microsoft\"]\n    A[\"Azure\"]\n    M -- \"Invested in\" --> O\n  end\n  \n  subgraph O[\"AI\"]\n    C[\"Chat\"]\n  end\n```\n\nIn this diagram M is referenced from within the M subgraph, this will break the diagram.\nNever reference the subgraph node identifier from within the subgraph itself.\nInstead move any edges that connect the subgraph with other nodes or subgraphs outside of the subgraph like so.\n\nCorrect subgraph usage:\n```\ngraph TB\n  subgraph M[\"Microsoft\"]\n    A[\"Azure\"]\n  end\n\n  M -- \"Invested in\" --> O\n  \n  subgraph O[\"OpenAI\"]\n    C[\"ChatGPT\"]\n  end\n```\n\nExamples:\nUser asks: \"Show me how vscode internals work.\"\n```\ngraph TB\n  U[\"User\"] -- \"File Operations\" --> FO[\"File Operations\"]\n  U -- \"Code Editor\" --> CE[\"Code Editor\"]\n  FO -- \"Manipulation of Files\" --> FS[\"FileSystem\"]\n  FS -- \"Write/Read\" --> D[\"Disk\"]\n  FS -- \"Compress/Decompress\" --> ZL[\"ZipLib\"]\n  FS -- \"Read\" --> IP[\"INIParser\"]\n  CE -- \"Create/Display/Edit\" --> WV[\"Webview\"]\n  CE -- \"Language/Code Analysis\" --> VCA[\"VSCodeAPI\"]\n  VCA -- \"Talks to\" --> VE[\"ValidationEngine\"]\n  WV -- \"Render UI\" --> HC[\"HTMLCSS\"]\n  VE -- \"Decorate Errors\" --> ED[\"ErrorDecoration\"]\n  VE -- \"Analyze Document\" --> TD[\"TextDocument\"]\n```\n\nUser asks: \"Draw me a mindmap for beer brewing. Maximum of 4 nodes\"\n```\ngraph TB\n  B[\"Beer\"]\n  B --> T[\"Types\"]\n  B --> I[\"Ingredients\"]\n  B --> BP[\"Brewing Process\"]\n```\n\nUser asks:\n\"Computing backend data services is a distributed system made of multiple microservices.\n\nA web browser sends an HTTP api request to the load balancer.\nThe load balancer sends the http request to the crossover service.\nCrossover talks to redis and mysql database.\nCrossover makes a downstream API request to multiplex to submit the query which returns a job id to crossover.\nThen crossover makes a long poll API request to evaluator to get the results of the job.\nThen evaluator makes an API call to multiplex to check the status of the job.\nOnce evaluator gets a successful status response from multiplex, then evaluator makes a third API call to result-fetcher service to download the job results from S3 or GCP cloud buckets.\nThe result is streamed back through evaluator to crossover.\n\nCrossover post processes the result and returns the API response to the client.\n\nDraw me a diagram of this system\"\n\n```\ngraph TB\n  A[\"Web Browser\"] -- \"HTTP API Request\" --> B[\"Load Balancer\"]\n  B -- \"HTTP Request\" --> C[\"Crossover\"]\n  C -- \"Talks to\" --> D[\"Redis\"]\n  C -- \"Talks to\" --> E[\"MySQL\"]\n  C -- \"Downstream API Request\" --> F[\"Multiplex\"]\n  F -- \"Returns Job ID\" --> C\n  C -- \"Long Poll API Request\" --> G[\"Evaluator\"]\n  G -- \"API Call\" --> F\n  G -- \"API Call\" --> H[\"Result-Fetcher\"]\n  H -- \"Downloads Results\" --> I[\"S3 or GCP Cloud Buckets\"]\n  I -- \"Results Stream\" --> G\n  G -- \"Results Stream\" --> C\n  C -- \"API Response\" --> A\n```\n\nSometimes you will need to revise the same diagram based on user feedback.\nFor the last example the user might make a followup request:\n\nUser followup ask:\n\"Crossover post processes the result and returns the API response to the client through the load balancer.\n\nDraw the crossover node in green\"\n\n```\nquery: \"graph TB\n  A[\"Web Browser\"] -- \"HTTP API Request\" --> B[\"Load Balancer\"]\n  B -- \"HTTP Request\" --> C[\"Crossover\"]\n  style C fill:#99cc99\n  C -- \"Talks to\" --> D[\"Redis\"]\n  C -- \"Talks to\" --> E[\"MySQL\"]\n  C -- \"Downstream API Request\" --> F[\"Multiplex\"]\n  F -- \"Returns Job ID\" --> C\n  C -- \"Long Poll API Request\" --> G[\"Evaluator\"]\n  G -- \"API Call\" --> F\n  G -- \"API Call\" --> H[\"Result-Fetcher\"]\n  H -- \"Downloads Results\" --> I[\"S3 or GCP Cloud Buckets\"]\n  I -- \"Results Stream\" --> G\n  G -- \"Results Stream\" --> C\n  C -- \"API Response\" --> B\n  B -- \"API Response\" --> A\n```\n","diagramThemes":"\nmermaid themes:\n```\ndefault - This is the default theme for all diagrams.\nneutral - This theme is great for black and white documents that will be printed.\ndark - This theme goes well with dark-colored elements or dark-mode.\nforest - This theme contains shades of green.\nbase - This is the only theme that can be modified.

### Assistant - 2023-08-09 19:48:46

**Ideas to improve the diagram:**

1. **Add Values**: Incorporate actual numerical values or strings to the nodes to give a more realistic representation of a binary search tree.
2. **Color Coding**: Use different colors for the nodes to differentiate between left and right children or to highlight certain paths.
3. **Annotations**: Add annotations or descriptions to certain nodes or edges to provide more context or explain specific properties of the tree.

Explore the following themes:
- **default**: This is the default theme for all diagrams.
- **neutral**: This theme is great for black and white documents that will be printed.
- **dark**: This theme goes well with dark-colored elements or dark-mode.
- **forest**: This theme contains shades of green.
- **base**: This is the only theme that can be modified. Use this theme as the base for customizations.

Generate a diagram of a binary search tree. Fill it with random integer data, where the integers are between 0 and 1000. 

### Assistant - 2023-08-09 19:51:14

Alright, I'll generate a binary search tree with random integer data between 0 and 1000. Let's see:

For this example, I'll use the following random integers:
- Root: 500
- Left Child of Root: 250
- Right Child of Root: 750
- Left Child of 250: 125
- Right Child of 250: 375
- Left Child of 750: 625
- Right Child of 750: 875

Let's create the diagram based on this data.

Russia continued its strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure while the Battle of Bakhmut escalated.\nThis timeline is a dynamic and fluid list, and as such may never satisfy criteria of completeness. Moreover, some events may only be fully understood and/or discovered in retrospect.\nThe United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution that held Russia responsible for all damage caused to Ukraine by the invasion and demanded reparations.\nRussia launched about 85 to 100 missiles at a number of Ukrainian cities. The strategic bombing campaign caused severe shortages of electricity and water at multiple cities. According to the Ukrainian Air Force some 77 of 96 Russian missiles were shot down. A Pentagon official claimed the Russian plan was to exhaust the Ukrainian air defences. At one stage some 50 missiles were in combat \"within minutes\" near the Polish border.\nA missile crossed over the Ukrainian-Polish border and struck the village of Przewodów, killing two civilians. Top leaders in Poland held an emergency meeting. Initial assessments by the United States found that the missile was likely to have been an air defence missile fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile.\nAccording to Ukraine's Operational Command South, Ukrainian rocket and artillery units attacked Russian positions on the left bank of the Dnipro River and in the area of the Kinburn Spit.\nAfter the missile strikes, more than 10 million people were without power by 17 November, but a day later Ukrainian officials reported that electricity had already been restored to \"nearly 100%\" of Ukraine.\nAccording to Ukrainian officials, one of the wrecks of missiles found after a missile attack earlier that day was that of an \"X-55/Kh-55\" cruise missile. These missiles were apparently incapable of carrying a conventional warhead, but this specific missile had an \"imitation block\" (model for training) of a nuclear bomb. They believed the missile was meant to help overwhelm Ukraine's missile defenses.\nThe European Parliament declared Russia a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" for the way it had systematically attacked civilians and committed war crimes. This declaration was symbolic, but called for more sanctions.\nThe Russian military launched 65 to 70 missiles at civilian settlements and energy infrastructure, although 51 of those were said to have been shot down. The attack caused blackouts over much of Ukraine and forced several nuclear power plants to shut down. Much of Moldova also experienced blackouts due to the power grid failure in Ukraine.\nAccording to U.S. and Ukrainian officials, about 1/3 of Western-supplied artillery went out of action in Ukraine due to wear-related mechanical problems. The United States European Command was said to have a repair base in Poland, but there were problems in transporting the weapons there from the front.\nThe Russian army was actively pushing on both sides of Bakhmut, in Donetsk Oblast. The Russians were trying to encircle the town but were making very slow progress, according to observers."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I?wprov=gpio1","title":"World War I","language":"en","text":"World War I From the top, left to right : British Cheshire Regiment at the Battle of the Somme , 1916 Ottoman Arab camel corps leaving for the Middle Eastern front , 1916 SMS Grosser Kurfürst during Operation Albion , 1917 German soldiers at the Battle of Verdun , 1916 Aftermath of the siege of Przemyśl , 1914–15 Bulgarian troops at the Monastir offensive , 1916 Date 28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918 (4 years, 3 months and 2 weeks) Location Europe Africa Middle East Pacific Atlantic Ocean Mediterranean Sea Result Allied Powers victory See Aftermath of World War I Territorial changes Formation of new countries in Europe and the Middle East, such as Yugoslavia , Weimar Germany , Poland , Soviet Union , Lithuania , Estonia , Latvia , Austria , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Turkey , Hejaz , and Yemen Transfer of German colonies and territories to other countries, partition of the Ottoman Empire , dissolution of Austria-Hungary Belligerents Allied Powers : France United Kingdom and its territori\nWorld War I or the First World War (often abbreviated as WWI or WW1, known contemporaneously as the Great War) was a major global conflict lasting from 1914 to 1918. It was fought between two coalitions, the Allies and the Central Powers. Fighting took place throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia.\nThe first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers. This reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. Russia came to Serbia's defence, and by 4 August, Germany, France and Britain were drawn into the war, with the Ottoman Empire joining in November the same year.\nGerman strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France by moving and attacking through Belgium before turning to face Russia. However, this failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more fluid, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite a series of costly offensives. As the war expanded onto more fronts, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Italy and others also joined in between 1915 and 1917. In early 1917, the United States entered the war on the side of the Allies, while in late 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power in the Russian October Revolution, making peace with the Central Powers in early 1918. Germany then launched an offensive in the west on March 1918, but despite initial success, it left the German army exhausted and demoralised, and a successful Allied counter-offensive later the same year caused a collapse of the German frontline. By the end of 1918, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary agreed to armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing revolution at home and with his army on the verge of mutiny, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November. An armistice three days later brought the fighting to a close, and the Paris Peace Conference imposed various settlements on the defeated powers, the best-known being the Treaty of Versailles. The dissolution of the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires resulted in the creation of new independent states (among them Poland, Finland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia).\nWorld War I was one of the deadliest wars in history; an estimated 9 million soldiers were killed in combat, plus another 23 million wounded, while 5 million civilians died as a result of military action, hunger, and disease. Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the devastation of the war heavily contributed to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that followed. Failure to manage the instability that resulted from this upheaval during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939.\nThe term world war was first coined in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel. He claimed that \"there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,\" in The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914.\nThe term First World War had been used by Lt-Col. Charles à Court Repington, as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of Harvard University in his diary entry of 10 September 1918.\nPrior to World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War. In August 1914, the magazine The Independent wrote \"This is the Great War. It names itself\". In October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, \"Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War.\" Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" and it was also described as \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life.\nFor much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power among themselves, known as the Concert of Europe. After 1848, this was challenged by a variety of factors, including Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia under Otto von Bismarck. The 1866 Austro-Prussian War established Prussian hegemony in Germany, while victory in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate the German states into a German Empire under Prussian leadership. Avenging the defeat of 1871, or revanchism, and recovering the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine became the principal objects of French policy for the next forty years.\nIn order to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors (German: Dreikaiserbund) between Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. After Russian victory in the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, the League was dissolved due to Austrian concerns over Russian influence in the Balkans, an area they considered of vital strategic interest. Germany and Austria-Hungary then formed the 1879 Dual Alliance, which became the Triple Alliance when Italy joined in 1882. For Bismarck, the purpose of these agreements was to isolate France by ensuring the three Empires resolved any disputes between themselves; when this was threatened in 1880 by British and French attempts to negotiate directly with Russia, he reformed the League in 1881, which was renewed in 1883 and 1885. After the agreement lapsed in 1887, he replaced it with the Reinsurance Treaty, a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.\nBismarck viewed peace with Russia as the foundation of German foreign policy but after becoming Kaiser in 1890, Wilhelm II forced him to retire and was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by his new Chancellor, Leo von Caprivi. This provided France an opportunity to counteract the Triple Alliance by signing the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894, followed by the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Britain. The Triple Entente was completed by the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention. While these were not formal alliances, by settling long-standing colonial disputes in Africa and Asia, the notion of British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia became a possibility. British and Russian support for France against Germany during the Agadir Crisis in 1911 reinforced their relationship and increased Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would erupt in 1914.\nGerman industrial strength and production significantly increased after 1871, driven by the creation of a unified Reich, French indemnity payments, and the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. Backed by Wilhelm II, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz sought to use this growth in economic power to build a Kaiserliche Marine, or Imperial German Navy, which could compete with the British Royal Navy for world naval supremacy. His thinking was influenced by US naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, who argued possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power projection; Tirpitz had his books translated into German, while Wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel.\nHowever, it was also an emotional decision, driven by Wilhelm's simultaneous admiration for the Royal Navy and desire to outdo and surpass it. Bismarck thought that the British would not interfere in Europe, so long as its maritime supremacy remained secure, but his dismissal in 1890 led to a change in policy and an Anglo-German naval arms race began. Despite the vast sums spent by Tirpitz, the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 gave the British a technological advantage over their German rivals which they never lost. Ultimately, the race diverted huge resources into creating a German navy large enough to antagonise Britain, but not defeat it; in 1911, Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg acknowledged defeat, leading to the Rüstungswende or 'armaments turning point', when he switched expenditure from the navy to the army."},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_on_Fire:_Ukraine%27s_Fight_for_Freedom?wprov=gpio1","title":"Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom","language":"en","text":"Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom Film poster Directed by Evgeny Afineevsky Written by Den Tolmor Based on Euromaidan protests Produced by Evgeny Afineevsky Den Tolmor Narrated by Cissy Jones Cinematography Various Edited by Will Znidaric Music by Jasha Klebe Production companies Netflix Afineevsky - Tolmor Productions Urkstream.tv SPN Productions Passion Pictures Campbell Grobman Films Rock Paper Scissors Entertainment Distributed by Netflix Release dates 3 September 2015 ( Venice Film Festival ) 9 October 2015 (Worldwide) Running time 102 minutes Countries Ukraine United States United Kingdom Languages Ukrainian Russian English\nWinter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom (Ukrainian: Зима у вогні: Боротьба України за свободу, Zyma u vohni: Borot'ba Ukrayini za svobodu) is a 2015 documentary film directed by Evgeny Afineevsky, written by  Den Tolmor about the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 to 23 February 2014.\nProduced by Evgeny Afineevsky, Den Tolmor and Netflix, the film is a coproduction of Ukraine, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nWinter on Fire was screened at various film festivals before its release on 9 October 2015 on Netflix.\nThe film had its world premiere at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, it won the People's Choice Award for best documentary.\nThis documentary follows the Euromaidan movement, in Kyiv, via a chronological approach to key events via historic footage and testimonies of two dozen protesters. The first events narrated are the expected EU-Ukraine trade agreement being promised as a way to elevate Ukraine's future, but this agreement is suddenly discarded in favor of one with Russia. Pro-Europe citizens organize protests and occupations, centered on and around Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti. After 4 months, the standoff between the government, its forces, and increasingly organized and dedicated protesters escalate into barricades, violent skirmishes, brutal repression, and deadly shootings by police on protesters. With the latest bloody and gruesome killings of protesters in February 2014, protest leaders vow to take down the government by force the following day. Ukraine's pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych flew to Russia in the early hours opening the way to new elections and a new Ukraine looking toward Europe.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, it has a rating of 88%, based on 25 reviews,  with an average rating of 7.5. It also has a score of 79 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nStephen Farber from The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, stating that \"Afineevsky found a variety of witnesses, including student activists, journalists, laborers, artists and clergy, who all add sharp voices to the collage. One of the most engaging of these interviewees is a 12-year-old boy who offers a remarkably unjaundiced view of the turmoil.\" He praised the editing and music, but criticized the fact that \"the film does grow repetitive, partly because it provides so little historical context or a larger overview of how the growing authoritarianism of Putin's Russia is affecting this part of the world. Yet there are unmistakably moving moments that convey the brutality of the government's response to an authentic popular movement\".\nJay Weissberg from Variety stated that Winter on Fire is an \"accessible film, with greater TV appeal, but it's also more limited by its insistence on shoehorning everything into one perspective, albeit a perspective shared by the majority of Ukrainians.\"\nDan Fainaru of Screen Daily wrote, \"Consistently avoiding any attempt at political analysis, Afineevsky's cameras show ever-expanding crowds, young and old, men and women, Christians, Jews, Muslims, academics and proletarians, all united under the one common cause, the removal of a man who, in their eyes, embodied the concept of corruption. Often exasperated by the politicians who were supposed to represent them and who cheated them, these people were willing to die, if necessary, to achieve their goal, displaying an idealistic fervour (i.e. the joined support of all religions) rarely encountered in normal circumstances\". He also praised Will Znidaric for the editing, calling it \"brisk and energetic\".\nEric Kohn from IndieWire gave it a grade \"A−\" on scale of A to F, stating that \"Winter on Fire features the intensity of an action movie and the fury of a clear-eyed polemic. [...] An exciting montage of the developing crowd ends with close to a million protestors gathered together at the centre of town in a stunning act of defiance. [...] Despite the ongoing power of these scenes, Winter on Fire achieves its finest shot with a bird’s eye view of the Maidan protests, as thousands of activists push back against a black mass of officers and congeal into an insurmountable wall. With images like these, Afineevsky doesn't need to push the message about the protesters' durability; it's right there on the screen.\"\nCritics Lev Golinkin, Amy Cooter and Jay Weissberg criticized the film for showing several symbols and flags described as \"neo-Nazi symbols used by extreme right wing protesters, left uncommented in the film.\" Golinkin was the most critical of the film. According to Golinkin, \"The colorful array of activists, artists, scarf-wrapped babushki, bearded priests and fresh-faced students makes it appear as if Ukraine's people from all walks of life in participated in the Maidan uprising. But some are missing — neo-Nazis, who were edited out\".\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and the Primetime Emmy Award in the Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking category."}],"extra_information_to_assistant":"In ALL responses, If Assistant includes information from sources other than Wikipedia, Assistant MUST indicate which information is not from Wikipedia.

The Ukraine war, also known as the Russo-Ukrainian War, began in 2014 and has seen several key moments. Here are some of the significant events:

1. **Annexation of Crimea (2014)**: Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was part of Ukraine, following a controversial referendum. This move was widely condemned by the international community and led to sanctions against Russia.

2. **Start of the Conflict in Eastern Ukraine (2014)**: Pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine declared independence, leading to a conflict with Ukrainian forces.

3. **Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 (2014)**: The passenger flight was shot down over Eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Investigations indicated that the plane was hit by a missile fired from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory.

4. **Minsk Agreements (2014 and 2015)**: These were ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and the pro-Russian separatists, brokered by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). However, sporadic fighting continued despite the agreements.

5. **Naval Confrontation near Kerch Strait (2018)**: Russian forces fired upon and captured three Ukrainian naval vessels near the Kerch Strait, escalating tensions between the two countries.

6. **Ukraine's Presidential Election (2019)**: Volodymyr Zelensky was elected as the President of Ukraine. His election brought hopes of a possible resolution to the conflict.

7. **Prisoner Exchanges (2019 and 2020)**: Ukraine and the pro-Russian separatists conducted several prisoner exchanges, leading to the release of many detainees on both sides.

8. **Renewed Clashes (2020)**: Despite the ceasefire agreements, there were renewed clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.

These are just some of the key moments in the ongoing conflict. It's worth noting that the situation remains fluid, with political, military, and diplomatic developments occurring regularly.
