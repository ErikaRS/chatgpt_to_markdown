Original statement: A pro dev can start loving Pro without being blocked on admin/security approval.

Feedback: +1 to this as a principle, but I'm not big on the current phrasing since, as the exception indicates, phrased this way, this is out of our control to a large extent. I'd prefer for our intended outcomes to focus on what we can control. So to think about rephrasing this, what is it that you want us to do differently by having this outcome listed?

Response: To me, this implies that we need to have a good experience that does not require GitHub OAuth before they can use it. (A previous version said that explicitly.) What did you think it meant? This is where some more detail would be helpful, but I know it makes it like an impenetrable wall of text.

Proposed response to the response: I wasn't sure what was meant, in terms of things we could control! Your clarification is a good one. It's feels narrow compared to the scope of this doc though. 

Please help me draft a proposed rephrasing of the original statement which feels general, actionable, and captures the spirit of the specific idea the response had in mind.

Considering the feedback and the need for a more actionable and controllable outcome, here's a proposed rephrasing of the original statement:

"Enable developers to seamlessly engage with Pro features by providing alternative authentication methods that do not solely rely on admin or security approvals."

This rephrasing focuses on the actionable aspect of providing alternative authentication methods, which is within the organization's control. It also captures the spirit of making the Pro experience accessible without the immediate need for GitHub OAuth, as mentioned in the response, thus addressing the concern of broadening the scope to include other aspects of accessibility and ease of use.

Propose a version that doesn't focus specifically on providing alternative authentication methods.

"Empower developers to fully leverage Pro features by ensuring a streamlined access process that minimizes dependencies on external approvals."

This version broadens the focus from specific solutions like alternative authentication methods to the overall goal of streamlined access. It captures the essence of making Pro features readily accessible to developers without explicitly mentioning the means to achieve it, thus leaving room for various strategies that are within the organization's control.
