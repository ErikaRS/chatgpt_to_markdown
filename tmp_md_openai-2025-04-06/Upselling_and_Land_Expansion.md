What it is called when you're going for growth of usage within the employee base of an existing enterprise customer? It's not plg because there's no direct conversation to paying customers. It's more about long term retention because you have a more heavily used product

The term you might be looking for is "upselling" or "cross-selling," depending on the specifics. If you're expanding the range of features or services that existing enterprise customers use, that's upselling. If you're encouraging usage across different departments or employee bases within the same organization, it could be called "land and expand." This approach aims for deeper penetration into an existing customer's organization to increase long-term retention and value.
