Clean up this short review of "a magical girl retires". Feel free to pull in additional information about the novel but keep the conclusions and tone as in the draft: This book was uneven in tone and pacing. It had a lot of intriguing ideas. But overall, it felt half developed. This isn't a matter of length; I enjoy short novels and novellas. Rather, it's that instead of focusing on and really developing a key arc, it pointed to a bunch of things but never really developed them.

Here's a refined version that maintains your conclusions and tone while adding some context:

---

The novel *A Magical Girl Retires* presents an uneven journey in terms of tone and pacing. It introduces many intriguing ideasâ€”an ex-magical girl's struggles to adapt to a mundane world, the impact of past battles on her psyche, and a broader commentary on heroism and sacrifice. However, these concepts feel half-developed. This isn't a matter of length, as short novels and novellas can be highly effective when focused. Rather, the book attempts to juggle too many threads without fully committing to any, leaving key arcs underexplored and ideas only half-realized.

Does this capture what you intended, or would you like any adjustments?
