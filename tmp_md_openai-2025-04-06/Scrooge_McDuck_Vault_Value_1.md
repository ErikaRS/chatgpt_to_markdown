**Evaluating Scrooge McDuck's wealth**

I’m pulling together estimates of Scrooge McDuck's net worth, factoring in his money bin's size, which is crucial for understanding his fictional fortune in today's US dollars.

**Mapping Scrooge McDuck's riches**

I’m piecing together Scrooge McDuck's net worth, noting Forbes' yearly updates and estimates from the comics and fan calculations.

OK, count me in as we explore the volume of Scrooge McDuck's money bin. It's estimated to be 1,000,000 cubic feet if it's a cube or 3 cubic acres in the comics.

**Deciphering cubic acres**

I’m mapping out the cubic acre unit, tied to 43,560 cubic feet, considering how Scrooge McDuck's money bin might fit this volume for accurate estimates.

**Evaluating estimates**

It's interesting to see varying estimates of Scrooge McDuck's money bin values, ranging from a fictional amount to $31 billion, and even to as much as $65.4 billion by Forbes.

**Adjusting net worth**

I'm recalculating Scrooge McDuck's net worth, considering inflation from 2013 to 2023, and assuming a conservative annual return on investment.

**Crunching the numbers**

I'm thinking through Scrooge McDuck's net worth using the volume of his money bin, filled with $20 U.S. gold coins. This involves converting units and calculating the volume of the coins.

**Calculating coin volume**

I’m working through the volume of a single coin using the formula for a cylinder, multiplying the area of the base by the height to estimate its volume.

**Figuring out volume**

OK, let's calculate the volume of a single coin by multiplying its area by its height. This gives around 0.00006407 cubic feet. Then, using a 60% packing efficiency, we estimate about 28.5 million coins could fit in the given space.

**Determining volume**

It's interesting to see that "three cubic acres" might refer to a volume of 130,680 cubic feet, which is smaller than earlier calculated volumes.

**Calculating potential**

I started by defining the volume of a cubic acre at 9,090,000 cubic feet. Adjusting for packing efficiency, the effective volume is 16,362,000 cubic feet. This can house around 255,321,529 coins. With each coin valued at $1,838, the total value reaches approximately $469.5 billion.

Estimating the value of Scrooge McDuck's legendary money bin involves a combination of comic lore, physics, and current economic data. Scrooge's wealth has been a subject of fascination and speculation for decades. Here's a detailed breakdown to determine how much his vault would be worth in today's U.S. dollars.

### **Volume of the Money Bin**

In the comics, Scrooge McDuck's fortune is whimsically described as "three cubic acres of cash." To calculate this volume:

1. **Understanding a Cubic Acre**: 
   - An **acre** is a unit of area equal to 43,560 square feet.
   - The length of one side of a square acre is approximately 208.71 feet.
   - A **cubic acre** would then be \( 208.71 \text{ ft} \times 208.71 \text{ ft} \times 208.71 \text{ ft} \approx 9,090,000 \text{ cubic feet} \).
2. **Total Volume**:
   - \( 3 \text{ cubic acres} \times 9,090,000 \text{ cubic feet} = 27,270,000 \text{ cubic feet} \).

### **Calculating the Number of Coins**

Assuming the money bin is filled with gold coins similar in size to a U.S. **Double Eagle** ($20 gold coin):

1. **Dimensions of a Double Eagle**:
   - **Diameter**: 34 mm (0.1115 feet).
   - **Thickness**: 2 mm (0.0065617 feet).
2. **Volume of a Single Coin**:
   - Radius \( r = \frac{0.1115}{2} \approx 0.05575 \text{ feet} \).
   - Volume \( V = \pi r^2 h \approx \pi \times (0.05575)^2 \times 0.0065617 \approx 0.00006407 \text{ cubic feet} \).
3. **Accounting for Packing Efficiency**:
   - Coins don't occupy all available space due to gaps. Assuming a **packing efficiency** of **60%**.
   - Effective volume occupied by coins: \( 27,270,000 \text{ cubic feet} \times 60\% = 16,362,000 \text{ cubic feet} \).
4. **Total Number of Coins**:
   - \( \frac{16,362,000 \text{ cubic feet}}{0.00006407 \text{ cubic feet/coin}} \approx 255,321,529 \text{ coins} \).

### **Valuing the Coins**

1. **Gold Content per Coin**:
   - Each Double Eagle contains **0.9675 troy ounces** of gold.
2. **Current Gold Price** (as of October 2023):
   - Approximately **$1,900 per troy ounce**.
3. **Value per Coin**:
   - \( 0.9675 \text{ oz} \times \$1,900/\text{oz} \approx \$1,838 \).
4. **Total Value of Coins**:
   - \( 255,321,529 \text{ coins} \times \$1,838/\text{coin} \approx \$469,521,753,302 \).

### **Conclusion**

Based on these calculations, **Scrooge McDuck's vault would be worth approximately \$470 billion in today's U.S. dollars**. This estimate places Scrooge well above the net worth of the world's richest individuals, emphasizing his status as the wealthiest duck (or individual) in the fictional world.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Comic Variations**: Different comics and adaptations may depict the size of the money bin differently, which could significantly alter the estimated value.
- **Non-Gold Assets**: Scrooge's wealth isn't limited to gold coins; it includes investments, properties, and rare artifacts, which could further increase his net worth.
- **Inflation and Gold Prices**: Fluctuations in gold prices and inflation rates can impact the estimated value over time.

**In summary**, Scrooge McDuck's legendary fortune, stored in his iconic money bin, would be worth around **$470 billion** today, highlighting the whimsical extravagance of his character in the world of Disney comics.
