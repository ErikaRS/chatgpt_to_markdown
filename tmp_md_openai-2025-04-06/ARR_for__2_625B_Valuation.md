To estimate the ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) needed to support a $2.625 billion valuation, we typically use a revenue multiple. The multiple varies based on the sector, growth rate, and market conditions, but for SaaS companies, it generally ranges from 5x to 15x.

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown using two different multiples:

- **At a 10x revenue multiple** (common for high-growth SaaS):
  \[
  \text{ARR} = \frac{\text{Valuation}}{\text{Multiple}} = \frac{2.625 \, \text{billion}}{10} = 262.5 \, \text{million}
  \]

- **At a 5x revenue multiple** (more conservative for mature or lower-growth companies):
  \[
  \text{ARR} = \frac{2.625 \, \text{billion}}{5} = 525 \, \text{million}
  \]

Thus, to support a $2.625 billion valuation, the company would need an ARR between **$262.5 million and $525 million**, depending on the revenue multiple.
