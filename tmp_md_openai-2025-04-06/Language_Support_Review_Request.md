Make this more concise and make the call to action more clear
Hey all! I was checking in on follow-up items from the PFP review notes and the one I never followed up on is
@csells would like to see the list of all the languages we currently support and determine where we draw the line and customer impact

I'm building off of this table and added all of the languages we have search-based code nav for. What I need help with is
filling out the state of heuristic code nav
Request: Point me back to those code files which have the language specs for languages that support any non-search heuristic code nav
Request: Help me understand if heuristic based code nav supports any other columns than go to definition and find references. The "cross-file" and "hover docs" are where I'm most uncertain
fact checking my assumptions on what is and is not supported for search based. Note that I assumed that what search based support doesn't vary by language, but I don't know!
Request: Confirm or correct that all non-heuristic search-based support is the same
Request: Check one row and see if the functionality-to-status mapping is correct

Hi everyone! I'm following up on PFP review notes. @csells wants to review our supported languages and assess customer impact.

I've listed languages with search-based code nav, but I need help with heuristic code nav status:
1. Identify language specs for non-search heuristic code nav.
2. Clarify if heuristic code nav supports more than "go to definition" and "find references."

Also, I'd appreciate help fact-checking my assumptions on consistent search-based support across languages.
Lastly, confirm or correct functionality-to-status mapping for one row.

Your assistance is crucial!
