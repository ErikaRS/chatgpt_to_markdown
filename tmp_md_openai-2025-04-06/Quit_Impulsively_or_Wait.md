I work at a startup as head of engineering reporting directly to the CEO. The CTO, who is supposed to be interim head of product, is constantly micromanaging engineering and constantly failing to provide product direction and vision. I'm also on day 3 of a bad cold. Convince me not to just quit today.

You're sick and exhausted, which is the worst time to make a big decision like quitting. Everything feels heavier and more frustrating when you're running on low energy, and what might be an urgent problem today could feel more solvable once you're back at full strength.

Beyond that, quitting today would give away any leverage you have. If the CTO’s behavior is untenable, there are steps you can take—escalating to the CEO, setting clearer boundaries, or forcing the product direction issue—before walking away. If you quit impulsively, you don’t get to control the story, and you leave the team in a lurch without setting yourself up for a strong next move.

Give yourself time. Rest, get some distance, and see if the situation looks any different in a week. If you still want to leave, do it in a way that serves you best—not just as a reaction to frustration while you're under the weather.

How can I leave in a way that serves me best?

Leaving in a way that serves you best means ensuring that you:
1. **Control the Narrative** – You want to leave on your terms, positioning your departure as a logical next step in your career rather than an escape from dysfunction.
2. **Maximize Your Leverage** – Use your current position to negotiate for a smoother transition, a strong reference, and possibly even a better exit package.
3. **Minimize Burnout and Emotional Fallout** – If you leave on impulse, you risk burning bridges and feeling regret about what you didn’t resolve.
4. **Set Up Your Next Move Thoughtfully** – Whether it’s a break, a new role, or consulting, you want time to position yourself well for what’s next.

### Steps to Leave Strategically:
#### **1. Gather Intel and Assess the Timing**
- Is there a product launch, funding round, or key moment coming up where your departure would be more disruptive? If so, you may want to time your exit to avoid being trapped in a guilt-driven retention effort.
- Who are your allies? Will your departure cause major fallout? Do you care?
- What are your contractual obligations (notice period, equity, etc.)?

#### **2. Line Up Your Next Step**
- If you don’t have a new job lined up, decide whether you want one before you resign.
- If you do want to take time off, ensure your finances are in order.
- If you might want to consult or advise, start having quiet conversations.

#### **3. Quietly Shift Ownership**
- Begin delegating key responsibilities so that your departure won’t cause chaos. This makes it harder for leadership to pressure you to stay.
- Document anything critical that only you know.

#### **4. Decide on Your Exit Message**
- Keep it professional. Something like:  
  *“I’ve decided that this is the right time for me to transition out of my role. I’m proud of what we’ve built, and I want to ensure a smooth handoff over the next X weeks.”*
- Do not vent. Even if the CEO and CTO are making the company unworkable, positioning your departure as forward-looking (rather than reactionary) preserves your professional reputation.

#### **5. Control the Exit Process**
- Give notice on your terms. Ideally, you offer a reasonable transition period (2-4 weeks), but if leadership responds badly, be prepared to leave sooner.
- Be clear about boundaries: You’re not taking on new projects or doing extra work during your notice period.
- If possible, secure written confirmation of any outstanding compensation, equity, or severance agreements.

### **Key Considerations:**
- **Do you want to fix anything before you go?** If you care about the team, you might want to push for some last-minute improvements (better leadership structure, hiring decisions, etc.).
- **Are you ready for the emotional fallout?** Some people will be supportive, but others may react poorly. That’s not your problem.
- **What’s your “no regrets” scenario?** Imagine yourself a month from now—what do you wish you had done differently? Make decisions based on that.

### **Why This Approach?**
Because quitting should be a power move, not an emotional reaction. By taking the time to leave well, you protect your reputation, relationships, and career momentum. You also avoid giving your current leadership the satisfaction of thinking they "wore you down" rather than acknowledging their own dysfunction. 

Take care of yourself first, then make your move when it benefits *you*.

What are ways I might control the narrative with my departure? I want to take a break for a few months rather than going straight to the next position

### Assistant - 2025-03-17 13:19:02

Since you want to take a break before your next role, controlling the narrative is about making sure that your departure is seen as a positive, professional step rather than a reaction to dysfunction. You want people to remember your contributions, not frame your exit as a crisis or a symptom of a deeper problem.  

Here’s how you can shape the story:  

---

### **1. Choose a Forward-Looking, Neutral Narrative**  
Instead of focusing on what’s wrong, position your departure as a natural transition:  

- **General Statement:**  
  *“After an intense few years, I’ve decided to take a step back and recharge before my next adventure.”*  
- **Slightly More Professional:**  
  *“I’ve been fortunate to work with an incredible team, but after leading engineering through [major milestone], this feels like the right time for me to take a break before deciding what’s next.”*  

This positions you as in control, avoiding any perception that you were forced out or leaving in frustration.  

---

### **2. Shape the Internal Company Narrative**  
You don’t want your departure to trigger panic, and you don’t want it framed as a referendum on leadership. A few ways to guide the internal messaging:  

- Offer to **collaborate on the announcement** with the CEO to ensure it reflects your framing.  
- If asked, suggest wording like:  
  - *“[Your Name] has been an essential leader in growing our engineering org. She’s now taking some well-earned time to recharge, and we’re grateful for everything she’s built.”*  
- If leadership is resistant, **put your version out there first** with a personal note to key colleagues.  

---

### **3. Directly Communicate with Your Network**  
For your broader professional network (LinkedIn, Slack groups, former colleagues), keep it high-level and optimistic:  

- **Example LinkedIn Post:**  
  *“After an amazing few years building [company name], I’ve decided to step back and take a break before exploring my next move. Grateful for the team and everything we built together—excited to see what’s next, but for now, I’m looking forward to some time off!”*  

This keeps it professional, open-ended, and prevents unnecessary speculation.  

---

### **4. Anticipate and Manage Tough Conversations**  
Some people will ask why you’re *really* leaving, especially if they suspect deeper issues. Have a few responses ready that balance honesty and diplomacy:  

- **For Close Colleagues:**  
  - *“There are a lot of things I could say, but at the end of the day, I just need a break. I’ve done what I can here, and now it’s time for something new.”*  
- **For Recruiters or Future Employers:**  
  - *“I wanted to take some time to reset before jumping into the next challenge. I knew if I took another role right away, I wouldn’t get that chance.”*  

The key is to acknowledge your reasons without getting drawn into negativity or drama.  

---

### **5. Set Boundaries Around Post-Exit Engagement**  
- Be mindful of how much you engage in post-exit company drama—staying too involved can make it seem like you regret leaving.  
- If leadership tries to pull you back in (consulting, informal advice), **be selective** about whether it serves your goals.  
- If the company starts to struggle, **avoid saying “I told you so” publicly**—your reputation will be stronger if you let others reach their own conclusions.  

---

### **Why This Works for You**  
- You leave **on your terms** without making leadership look like the problem (even if they are).  
- You keep doors open while making it clear you’re **not looking for something new right away**.  
- You protect your **professional brand**, ensuring that when you’re ready for the next step, you can frame this time as a well-deserved sabbatical rather than a reaction to burnout.  

The real power move is leaving in a way that makes people think, *Wow, she handled that well.*
