Is "working the paddles" an idiomatic way to talk about rowing a boat? If not, what's a better way of phrasing it

"Working the paddles" isn't a common idiom or phrase for rowing a boat. Paddles are generally associated with canoes or kayaks, whereas oars are used in rowboats. Here are a few ways to phrase it based on the context:

1. If you're talking about a canoe or kayak: "Paddling the canoe" or "paddling the kayak."
2. For rowboats: "Rowing the boat" or simply "rowing."

So, depending on the type of boat and the context, "paddling" or "rowing" would be the most suitable verbs. If you're unsure about the specific type of boat or just want to keep it general, "paddling" would likely be understood in a broad sense.
