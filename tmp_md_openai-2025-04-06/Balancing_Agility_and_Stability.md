I am a VP at a small technology company. I am responding to a comment on our biweekly eNPS survey. Please critique the draft response for clarity and whether or not it appropriately hits a balance between acknowledging past problems and hope for the future. Also suggest an edited version, but keep the edits minimal.

COMMENT:
Agree: Our company is making progress that will lead to future success.
 
I feel like we need to expect the unexpected and that change is the only thing that is constant. On one hand being agile is valued in the business, on the other hand I do not know if we will end up in a better environment by constant changes than having a single set of bets and execute on them.

DRAFT RESPONSE: 
"on the other hand I do not know if we will end up in a better environment by constant changes than having a single set of bets and execute on them." I strongly agree with this. The balance I would like to see us achieve is one where we surface information that would cause us to change our mind early, adjust plans quickly, and then keep plans stable until something material changes. By material, I don't just mean that we learn something new, but that we learn something new that we could not have been reasonably expected to know before. We will never fully hit this ideal. However, I think we'll be doing well when after a change, those involved in the change can say, "Here is the concrete reason we chose to make this change" rather than it feeling like we hadn't fully thought through the initial plan. We have started to have some examples of success as part of the PFP review process.

Critique:
1. **Acknowledging Past Problems**: Your response appropriately acknowledges the concern raised by the commenter about the balance between agility and stability.
2. **Hope for the Future**: Your statement about what you'd like the company to achieve in terms of balancing change provides a positive outlook and an actionable vision.
3. **Clarity**: The draft is generally clear but contains a few sentences that might be simplified or broken up for better readability.
4. **Balance**: The message strikes a balance between recognizing the past and pointing towards a hopeful future.

Edited Version:
"I strongly resonate with your point about finding the right balance between agility and stability. It's essential for us to surface information early that could influence our decisions, pivot quickly when needed, and then maintain a stable plan until there's a significant reason to change. By 'significant,' I mean unexpected insights that werenâ€™t foreseeable at the onset. We might not always get this perfect, but our goal is to ensure that when changes do occur, the reasons are clear and justified, rather than seeming impulsive. We've already seen some positive strides with the PFP review process. Your feedback is invaluable as we continue refining our approach."

Which sentences might be simplified or broken up?

### Assistant - 2023-10-27 14:17:46

Certainly! Here are the sentences in your draft that might be simplified or broken up for better readability, along with suggestions:

1. **Original**: "The balance I would like to see us achieve is one where we surface information that would cause us to change our mind early, adjust plans quickly, and then keep plans stable until something material changes."
   
   **Suggestion**: "I'd like us to achieve a balance where we identify crucial information early, adjust our plans promptly, and then maintain stability unless there's a significant reason to shift."

2. **Original**: "By material, I don't just mean that we learn something new, but that we learn something new that we could not have been reasonably expected to know before."
   
   **Suggestion**: "By 'material,' I'm referring to unforeseen insights, not just any new information."

3. **Original**: "However, I think we'll be doing well when after a change, those involved in the change can say, "Here is the concrete reason we chose to make this change" rather than it feeling like we hadn't fully thought through the initial plan."

   **Suggestion**: "Our aim is for team members to confidently say, 'We made this change for these specific reasons,' rather than feeling the initial plan was rushed or ill-considered."

These suggestions make the message more concise and direct, improving clarity.

"on the other hand I do not know if we will end up in a better environment by constant changes than having a single set of bets and execute on them." I strongly agree with this. I'd like us to achieve a balance where we identify crucial information early, adjust our plans promptly, and then maintain stability unless there's a significant reason to shift. By "significant," I mean unforeseen insights, not something we failed to consider in the initial plan. Ideally team members will be able to confidently say, 'We made this change for these specific reasons,' rather than feeling the initial plan was rushed or ill-considered.

1. **Acknowledging Past Problems**: The revised draft still appropriately acknowledges the concern raised by the commenter. By stating "I strongly agree with this," you show understanding and alignment with the employee's perspective.
 
2. **Hope for the Future**: The statement about achieving balance between identifying crucial information early and maintaining stability provides a clear, positive direction for the company. The description of what is meant by "significant" further refines and clarifies the vision.

3. **Clarity**: The revised draft is clearer and more concise than the initial one. The sentences are simpler and more straightforward, making them easier to understand.

4. **Balance**: The message maintains a balance between acknowledging the past and pointing towards an optimistic future.

5. **Flow**: The revised version reads smoothly. The transitions between the sentences are logical, and there's a clear progression from acknowledging the problem to laying out the solution.

Overall, the new version is improved and effectively communicates the desired message.

COMMENT:
Strongly Disagree: The pace of work here enables me to do a good job.

With the pace of work and decision making it is very difficult to focus on the important things and to ship quality (which also requires process), instead we tend to focus on the urgent, and ship something to satisfy immediate needs or requests. We might be a little too short sighted.

DRAFT RESPONSE:
We have experienced a lot of churn in our plans, and that often has led to a focus on solutions that are not as high quality as they need to be. Our current plans include more focus on quality and stability. The focus on lovability for both Code Search and Cody supports that. We do need to balance that with an acknowledgement that some problems are urgent and require urgent solutions. Where we fail is when we treat every problem as urgent and only give it an urgent level of quality. To quote from the Successful Engineers at Sourcegraph doc, we need to "know that a sense of urgency is not about shipping hacks, but about finding the quickest solutions with the right tradeoffs for the problem at hand"

### Assistant - 2023-10-27 14:25:42

Critique:

1. **Acknowledging Past Problems**: The draft does a commendable job of acknowledging the concerns. By recognizing the challenges and shortcomings, it builds credibility.
 
2. **Hope for the Future**: The mention of "Our current plans include more focus on quality and stability" gives hope and direction for the future. Referencing specific initiatives (Code Search and Cody) provides concrete examples of the commitment to change.

3. **Clarity**: While the overall message is clear, some of the sentences are a tad lengthy and might benefit from simplification.

4. **Balance**: The draft is balanced in acknowledging past issues and conveying a positive outlook for the future. However, referencing specific documents (like the Successful Engineers at Sourcegraph doc) might not resonate with everyone if they're not familiar with it.

5. **Tone**: The tone is open, candid, and constructive. It's neither overly defensive nor dismissive.

Edited Version:

"We recognize the concerns around the pace of our work affecting focus and quality. It's evident we've sometimes prioritized immediate solutions over long-term quality. We are refocusing our approach. Initiatives like Code Search and Cody underscore our commitment to enhancing quality and stability. While some problems genuinely require quick solutions, not every issue should be treated with the same level of urgency. Our goal, as highlighted in our guiding principles, is to blend urgency with the right trade-offs, ensuring we're both timely and effective."

Which sentences might be simplified or broken up?

### Assistant - 2023-10-27 14:26:19

From your original draft response, here are the sentences that might benefit from simplification or being broken up for better clarity:

1. **Original**: "We have experienced a lot of churn in our plans, and that often has led to a focus on solutions that are not as high quality as they need to be."
   
   **Suggestion**: "Our plans have seen considerable churn, often leading us to prioritize quick solutions over quality."

2. **Original**: "We do need to balance that with an acknowledgement that some problems are urgent and require urgent solutions."
   
   **Suggestion**: "While we understand that some problems demand immediate solutions, it's crucial to strike a balance."

3. **Original**: "Where we fail is when we treat every problem as urgent and only give it an urgent level of quality."
   
   **Suggestion**: "Our shortfall arises when we treat all problems as immediate and compromise on quality."

4. **Original**: "To quote from the Successful Engineers at Sourcegraph doc, we need to "know that a sense of urgency is not about shipping hacks, but about finding the quickest solutions with the right tradeoffs for the problem at hand"."
   
   **Suggestion**: "As our guidelines suggest, urgency shouldn't mean compromising quality but making informed, swift decisions."

These adjustments aim to streamline the message and make it easier to grasp for the reader.
