I see an infrastructure team that acts in two modes: either they see themselves as owners of purely infrastructure products or they see themselves as purely request driven service providers of product owned requirements. I would love to push the team to consider a third model: where they utilize their deep expertise in building infrastructure to help guide the product teams to building the right infrastructure. 

Is there a term for this sort of technical leadership and partnership? 

### Assistant - 2024-02-09 15:20:07

The approach you're describing aligns with a model of collaboration and technical leadership known as "Partner Engineering" or "Platform Engineering." In this model, the infrastructure team acts as a partner to the product teams, leveraging their deep expertise in infrastructure to guide and support the product teams in designing and implementing the most appropriate, efficient, and scalable solutions. This partnership fosters a culture of collaboration, shared responsibility, and mutual respect between infrastructure and product teams.

### Partner Engineering

In the context of Partner Engineering, the infrastructure team doesn't just build infrastructure in isolation or act solely upon direct requests. Instead, they work closely with product teams from the planning stages through to implementation, offering insights, recommendations, and technical guidance. This proactive involvement helps ensure that the product teams make informed decisions about technology and infrastructure, leading to better outcomes for the organization as a whole.

### Platform Engineering

Similarly, "Platform Engineering" is another term that encapsulates this approach. Platform teams create and maintain a set of tools, services, and best practices that are leveraged across the organization to improve productivity, efficiency, and scalability. By offering a platform as a product to the internal teams, they enable those teams to build upon a solid, reliable foundation, reducing duplication of effort and fostering innovation.

### Benefits of This Model

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Encourages a collaborative environment where teams work together to solve complex problems.
- **Increased Efficiency**: By leveraging shared platforms and expertise, teams can avoid reinventing the wheel and focus on delivering value more efficiently.
- **Improved Quality**: With infrastructure experts involved from the start, projects are more likely to be well-architected, secure, and scalable.
- **Faster Time to Market**: Streamlined workflows and pre-built infrastructure components can accelerate development cycles.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitates the transfer of knowledge and best practices across teams, enhancing the organization's overall technical capabilities.

### Implementing This Model

To transition to this model, leadership could consider steps like:

1. **Define Clear Roles and Responsibilities**: Ensure both infrastructure and product teams understand the value and expectations of this collaborative approach.
2. **Foster a Culture of Open Communication**: Encourage regular meetings, shared documentation, and open channels for questions and discussions.
3. **Invest in Shared Tools and Platforms**: Develop and maintain shared infrastructure services that product teams can easily integrate into their projects.
4. **Provide Training and Resources**: Offer opportunities for product teams to learn about infrastructure best practices, tools, and technologies.
5. **Measure and Share Successes**: Highlight successful collaborations and the benefits realized from this partnership to encourage continued engagement and improvement.

Adopting this model of technical leadership and partnership can transform how infrastructure and product teams interact, leading to more innovative, resilient, and efficient outcomes.

It seems there was an issue with accessing live search results. Despite this, I can guide you towards types of resources and avenues where you might find valuable information on Partner Engineering and similar collaborative technical leadership models:

1. **Industry Blogs and Articles**: Many technology companies and engineering leaders share their experiences and insights through blogs and articles. Look for posts on websites of companies known for their engineering culture, like Google, Netflix, and Spotify, as they often discuss their approaches to infrastructure and partnerships.

2. **Technical Conferences and Talks**: Conferences like QCon, DevOps Days, and KubeCon often feature talks on modern engineering practices, including Partner Engineering and Platform Engineering. Recorded sessions or summaries of these talks can be valuable sources of information.

3. **Professional Networks and Communities**: Joining professional networks like LinkedIn or specialized forums and communities (e.g., Dev.to, Hacker News) can provide access to discussions and content shared by professionals involved in Partner Engineering.

4. **Official Documentation of Tools and Platforms**: Many infrastructure tools and platforms have their documentation and best practices guides. These can indirectly provide insights into how to build and maintain effective partnerships between infrastructure teams and product developers. Look for documentation from Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for best practices in infrastructure management and collaboration.

5. **Books on Software Engineering Practices**: While not specifically focused on Partner Engineering, books on software engineering, DevOps, and team collaboration often touch upon themes relevant to building effective technical partnerships. Titles like "Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations" by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim, and "Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow" by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais, can provide valuable frameworks and insights.

6. **Corporate Case Studies**: Some organizations publish case studies or white papers on their engineering processes, including how they structure collaborations between teams. These can offer concrete examples of Partner Engineering in action.

While I'm unable to provide direct links or specific documents due to the search issue, these avenues should lead you to valuable insights and best practices on the subject.

Are you sure "partner engineering" is a known industry term. When I look it up, I mostly find definitions that are more akin to solutions engineering, working with external partners to implement solutions. Not the sort of partnership between infrastructure and product teams described here

### Assistant - 2024-02-09 15:57:31

You're correct, and I appreciate your patience and the opportunity to clarify. The term "Partner Engineering" is indeed more commonly associated with roles that involve working with external business partners, clients, or third-party developers to integrate or implement solutions. This misunderstanding highlights the importance of clear terminology.

The concept I described, focusing on collaboration between infrastructure and product teams within an organization, aligns more closely with **Platform Engineering**, **DevOps**, or **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** practices, albeit with a strong emphasis on partnership and collaboration.

### More Accurate Terms and Concepts:

- **Platform Engineering**: Focuses on creating internal platforms that product teams can use to develop and deploy their applications more efficiently. This role involves building tools, services, and capabilities that abstract away complexity and enable product teams to focus on delivering business value.

- **DevOps**: Emphasizes the collaboration between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve agility, quality, and reliability of software delivery. DevOps practices encourage a culture of collaboration, shared responsibility, and continuous improvement across the entire software development lifecycle.

- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**: Introduced by Google, SRE focuses on creating scalable and reliable software systems. SREs use a combination of software engineering and systems engineering principles to solve operational problems and ensure system reliability. SRE practices often involve close collaboration between development and operations teams to balance the need for reliability with the need for feature development and deployment speed.

### Implementing Collaborative Practices:

To foster the kind of internal partnership and technical leadership between infrastructure and product teams as initially described, consider adopting principles from these areas:

1. **Cross-functional Teams**: Encourage teams that include members with diverse skills (development, operations, security, etc.) to work towards common goals.

2. **Shared Ownership**: Promote a culture where both infrastructure and product teams share responsibility for the success and reliability of the products and services.

3. **Continuous Feedback**: Implement processes that facilitate ongoing communication and feedback between teams, such as regular review meetings, shared metrics, and collaborative planning sessions.

4. **Empowerment and Autonomy**: Give teams the autonomy to make decisions and the ability to access the tools and resources they need, while ensuring they have a clear understanding of organizational goals and constraints.

5. **Education and Sharing**: Foster a culture of learning and knowledge sharing, where teams are encouraged to share insights, best practices, and learnings both from successes and failures.

While "Partner Engineering" was a misnomer in this context, the goal of fostering a collaborative, partnership-based approach within an organization is a valuable one, drawing on principles from DevOps, Platform Engineering, and SRE practices.
