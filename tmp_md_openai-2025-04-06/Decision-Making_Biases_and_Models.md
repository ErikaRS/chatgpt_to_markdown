Categorize this very rough transcript into a set of article stubs. Each stub should focus on one clear idea and its development to an interesting outcome. It's okay if stubs are partial and incomplete. (Ignore the names preceding the comments.)

Any categorization we focus on how bad it is to be wrong
Wesley: Connection with negativity biasÂ 
Dart: Things that take you out of the gene pool are more important

Justin: But if you're a VC spreading your risk, you want people not to pay to much to the chance of being wrong

Dart: Outsourcing being wrong

Wesley: Then survivorship bias

Tigers in kitchens vs sandwiches

Erika: There's also a connection to the way that the black hole at the middle of the cnefin model has changed over time. That points to uncertainty about uncertainty

Justin: Connection the trope of waking up in a video game and understanding the world

Dart: That's interesting because it's a personal view of the model vs the idea of the truly unknowable. Unknown vs unknowable.

Jasen: Can never get rid of the blindspot . Enternal blindspot.

Erika: Eternal blindspot can also be contrasted with cultural blindspot. We think it's eternal, but it's actual a local view.

Wesley: Need many metrics to decide what is an anomoly. Similarly, brainstorming, drawing from across the org helps define normative vs outlier. Poling an individual doesn't tell you this.

Wesley: Input vs output randomness: Output randomness. If you only have one of the idea of the future, you can't tell how anomolous it is. But if you have many ideas, you can see that 8 of the 10 are similar. The other ones are possible, but they're more anomolous.

Erika: Even within those similar outcomes, you can think about your levers of control and if you even care.

Wesley: Possible futures, probably futures, preferred futures. You can hope to change the probable outcome.

Justin: Hope is an interesting word. How much does hope play in the cynefin model? How does it apply to that blind spot. Cynefin is very diagnostic. Doesn't talk about outcomes, hopes, and dreams.

Wesley: Doesn't really relate to preference at all. It's more of a sense making framework than influence. It does make some recommendations on how to behave.

Erika: Going back to what dart was saying, we can then compare where we think we are on cynefin to where we actually are.

Erika: Do you know the stakes? Creativity looks attractive in the face of death.

Wesley: Connection to the cone of uncertainty, [Have we written that up as a lens.] More uncertainty further out.

Spencer: The possibilities you think are realistic vs the possibilities that are actually realistic. "We'd need to be top 5" "Yeah, that's our goal". Need to look at the reasonable next possible.

Erika: Want to ;look at the gap between what will keep you alive and your greatest ambition.

Spencer: You want that to be as wide as possible.

Wesley: The nice thing about scenarios is that you can keep the "candy" scenario as one of the options and talk about both of these as possibilities. Feels maybe more tractable.

Spencer: VC process doesn't necessarily choose the right people. Can choose people who are unreasonable even in the face of failure. Need people who can navigate the challenge. Gotta learn how to be a good leader.

Ade: Minimally effective leader: incredibly generative lens

Jasen: What's the developmental ramp for founders? Views parenting as a similar problem. How do help grow kids?

Ade: Recursive leadership could be an answer

Spencer: One challenge is that if you're committed to the wrong thing, you can't be a good leader. Need the humility to decide to do something difference.

Ade: Base case: you must successfully lead yourself before you can successfully lead others.
Spencer: Micromanagement is damaging.
Spencer, summarizing Ade: I think the base action here is self-reflection and a commitment to self awareness

Wesley: For children, it can be useful to frame things in terms of identity, "be a helper"

Spencer: community values at family scale that everyone (parents included) are committed to.
Discussion of conformity:

Ade: Sometimes conformity is more important than problem solving

Spencer: Conformity

Boris: Most non-conformers aren't successful. Steel manning conformism, not sure he believes.

Erika: Conformity as the mechanism of privilege. Conforming to expectations gives you a budget. For some people, conformity is not built in though, so they suffer the costs of non-cormity involuntarily.

Wesley: Conforming can be a tool but not everyone has the same range of conformity available to them.
