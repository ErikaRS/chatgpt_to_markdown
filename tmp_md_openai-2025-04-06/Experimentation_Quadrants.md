Minimum viable product? Minimal lovable product? Whatever philosophy you fall into when it comes to the right approach to finding product-market fit, it’s accepted knowledge that those working to create a product must create a minimal product. The Lean Startup and its successors taught us that experimentation is key to success.

This isn’t always true. Sometimes innovation requires finding the core of a powerful idea and slowly growing it over time. However, there’s good reason experimentation is valued. If we can iterate and have the discipline to stockpile and utilize the lessons we learn, then experimentation can help us get better over time. Iteration and learning, these are the keys to experimentation. However, not all situations are amenable to true experimentation. 

We can iterate quickly when the stakes are low. When the stakes are high, then we cannot afford to fail. When the stakes are low – when the experiment itself doesn’t require too many resources and the consequences of an experiment gone wrong are safe – then we can hypothesize, test, fail, learn, and test again. 

We can learn when there is ambiguity. If a situation is not ambiguous, if there isn’t something we don’t know, then we are not going to learn. The ambiguity is defined by the proportion of stable constraints within the environment. Less ambiguous environments are those where most constraints are stable and known. In more ambiguous environments, the constraints are more ephemeral, existing ones shifting or disappearing, and new ones emerging.

We may put the label of “experiment” on anything that we want to be seen as innovative. Yet if we look at the preconditions for true experimentation – low stakes and high ambiguity which enable iterative learning – then we can start to see that some things we might call experimentation are actually something else. We can explore these via a 2x2.




Moving counterclockwise, let’s start with the top-right quadrant. This is the quadrant of true experimentation, where we have room to fail and learn from our mistakes.

As the stakes rise, we move to the top-left quadrant. Here, what we call “experiments” are actually bets. The ambiguity is high, but so are the stakes. Each failure comes at high cost, and the rewards of success can be equally large. While this quadrant can feel exciting, very little learning will happen here – other than learning to avoid experimenting in high-stakes environments. That isn’t to say this quadrant is bad. This is where most startups sit. However, people in this quadrant will be well served by remembering that they are gambling and they can only afford a small number of bets. 

In the next quadrant, the stakes are high and the ambiguity is low. This might be where we find ourselves if we have a successful existing business, our cash cow that supports everything else we do. In these situations, teams often find themselves running “experiments”: Which call to action is more effective? Do we put the button here or there? These are actually quality assurance tests. Because we mostly know the constraints, there is no real experimentation going on. This is just part of our pipeline for maximizing value.

Moving to the final quadrant, we’ll find ourselves in a place where there’s low ambiguity and low stakes. This is the realm of play – because the constraints are known, there’s very little new insight to uncover. We’re just chilling and having a good time. Not to say this is bad – lots of discoveries come from the play quadrant. However, they won’t be a direct outcome of experimentation. Rather, they will be the side effect of a human mind relaxing and loosening up. This distinction between experimentation and play is why play is so important to children. In childhood, the ambiguity is high so play is actually an important arena for experimentation. 

The desire to be innovative can encourage us to hold experimentation on a pedestal. However, if we are more precise in what we mean by “experimentation”, if we’re more conscious of what quadrant we are in, then we can take a more intentional approach and avoid being disappointed when our “experiments” don’t have the outcome we desire.

The text you provided offers a framework for understanding different contexts in terms of experimentation and innovation. Here's a breakdown of the four quadrants described:

1. True Experimentation (High Ambiguity, Low Stakes): This quadrant represents situations where there is a high level of ambiguity, meaning many unknowns and unstable constraints. However, the stakes are low, allowing room for failure and learning. True experimentation occurs here, as you can hypothesize, test, fail, learn, and iterate without significant consequences.

2. Bets (High Ambiguity, High Stakes): In this quadrant, both ambiguity and stakes are high. The term "experiments" used here is a misnomer because the consequences of failure can be costly. Instead, these situations involve making strategic bets where the potential rewards of success are significant. Learning may be limited, and it's important to recognize the risks involved.

3. Quality Assurance (Low Ambiguity, High Stakes): This quadrant represents contexts where stakes are high, such as existing successful businesses. The constraints are well-known, and there is little ambiguity. Here, what may appear as experiments are actually quality assurance tests or optimization efforts to maximize value within the established constraints.

4. Play (Low Ambiguity, Low Stakes): The final quadrant is characterized by low ambiguity and low stakes. The constraints are known, and there is little to learn in terms of innovation. This is a realm of play, where creativity and relaxation can lead to serendipitous discoveries, even though they may not directly result from experimentation.

By understanding which quadrant a situation falls into, individuals and teams can adopt a more intentional approach to their efforts. Recognizing the level of ambiguity and the stakes involved allows for better decision-making and managing expectations regarding outcomes.
