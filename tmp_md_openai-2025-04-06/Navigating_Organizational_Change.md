Make this conversation shorter:
🦊 Fox: I’m trying to push some long-term change in my organization, but it’s rough going since it doesn’t line up with the usual incentives. Someone who’s been here longer told me to think of the place as a river—you can’t turn it without accounting for the flow. I need to understand how to act on the river to change its course but also appreciate the fact that doing so creates friction and turbulence, which needs to be predicted and mitigated. It also takes substantial amount of effort more than if the river was empty... but it can't be. The river metaphor has helped, but it doesn’t feel like the whole story.


🦦Otter: An extension of the river metaphor might be the idea of oxbow lakes. An oxbow lake is formed when a wide meander from a river is cut off, creating a free-standing lake. When you try to change the river, you might end up cut off—you become the oxbow lake. Or you try to figure out what will oxbow, and make sure you are on the right side of it. 

🦆Duck: I've also tried to steer some big systems toward illegible outcomes. I’ve had luck with thinking of my goal as a canoe on the river, not an attempt to change the river itself. A canoe is much more in your control. There are two ways to turn a canoe: by paddling backwards on one side or by paddling harder on the other. Paddling backwards is trying to push back against bad behavior. It creates resentment and trains people to avoid you. Paddling forward is about amplifying good things through public praise, funding etc. so that people are attracted to your goals. People may not even know at first what you are training them to do, but they will still respond. 

🐻Bear: Let’s build on that. Paddling backward—or even just letting the paddles rest in the water—kills your forward momentum. You avoid it by "feathering", where you turn the paddles so they are above and parallel to the water on the return stroke. This allows the paddles to stay nearer to the water without touching it and even contribute (in I imagine a rather tiny way) to aerodynamics. Speed comes from paddling forward and avoiding backward friction. 

🦙 Llama: Ann Pendleton-Jullian talks about 3 metaphors for her life. Early on, she saw it as a large cruise ship steaming straight ahead. In her 30s, she switched to the metaphor of a sailboat as she became more aware of how life's winds can throw you off course. You need to respond to the waves and the weather. But in her 40s, she needed to explain the chaos and complexity around her. She switched to the metaphor of a white water kayaker: it’s fast, it’s furious, and there’s no way to take your whole environment into account. Instead, you have to feel it as you go through. You have to put your oar in the water to even understand the currents and how to respond.

🦦Otter: What I love about this is that it speaks to experience and familiarity with the river. Even in whitewater, a seasoned river guide or a local paddler picks up on so many signals and patterns. If a seasoned river guide goes to a new river they must leverage all their sense making and exploration skills consciously. They feel their way forward. They know they shouldn't go full gas or commit to any seemingly one-way door decisions.

🦙 Llama: Isn't water such a great metaphor for complexity? We often use metaphors of state changes—solid ice to liquid water to gas. How we navigate different modes of water from still to violent seas provide a different angle on water metaphors. 

🐙 Octopus: If you like water metaphors, I'm playing around with "the waterpark" as an organizational metaphor that combines strong structure, fluidity and emergence, Pace Layers, and learning organizations. A waterpark is an amalgamation of spaces where different areas have their own unique flows, jobs to be done, rhythms, roles, and purposes but all work together to create an amazing experience for everyone. Every area of the park—from the gate to wave pools to the lazy river—has specific needs, roles and responsibilities. 

🦊 Fox:This has given me a lot to think about. Thanks much! 🙏 not exactly sure how to translate all of the expansion of the water metaphors to my specific problem but I love the divergence of it all; it feels like a good mental stretching routine.

🦊 Fox: I’m trying to push long-term change, but it doesn’t fit with our usual incentives. Someone here told me to think of the organization as a river—you can’t turn it without working with its flow. I need to change the course while managing the friction it creates.

🦦 Otter: Consider oxbow lakes—sometimes, trying to change the river’s flow means you could get cut off, becoming a separate lake. Maybe watch for what’s likely to get isolated and position yourself on the right side.

🦆 Duck: I’ve had success by focusing on my goals as a canoe on the river. You steer by paddling backwards on one side or harder on the other. Paddling backwards is pushing against bad behavior but creates resentment. Paddling forward—amplifying positives with praise and resources—draws people to your goal without resistance.

🐻 Bear: Good point—paddling backward kills momentum. Instead, "feather" the paddle by lifting it just above the water on the return stroke to avoid friction and keep moving forward.

🦙 Llama: This reminds me of Ann Pendleton-Jullian’s life metaphors: from a cruise ship to a sailboat to a whitewater kayak, each capturing different levels of control and responsiveness. She says you learn to feel the currents as you navigate complexity.

🦦 Otter: Experienced river guides do just that. They sense patterns and stay open to exploration, especially on new rivers.

🦙 Llama: Water is a great metaphor for complexity, especially through its states—ice, water, vapor. It’s about adapting to its changing nature.

🐙 Octopus: I think of organizations as waterparks—each area has unique flows, rhythms, and roles, working together to create a cohesive experience.

🦊 Fox: Thanks, everyone! These ideas are giving me a lot to work with.

Make this shorter without losing the conversational flow and keeping some of the nuance. Remove redundancy, not nuance.

🦊 Fox: I’m pushing for long-term change, but it clashes with current incentives. I was told to think of the organization as a river—you can’t change its course without managing the flow and the friction it creates. The metaphor helps, but I think there’s more to it.

🦦 Otter: Think of oxbow lakes. When a river meander is cut off, it forms a separate lake. If you change the flow too sharply, you might isolate yourself—becoming an oxbow lake.

🦆 Duck: I approach it as steering a canoe. Paddling backward pushes against bad behavior but creates resistance. Paddling forward amplifies positive behaviors, drawing people toward your goal.

🐻 Bear: Right, backward paddling kills momentum. “Feather” the paddles—lift them slightly on the return stroke to avoid drag, helping you keep forward speed.

🦙 Llama: Ann Pendleton-Jullian uses water metaphors for life’s stages: first a cruise ship, then a sailboat, then a whitewater kayak for navigating complexity and unpredictability.

🦦 Otter: Experienced guides feel the current and don’t go full throttle in unfamiliar waters—they explore and adapt to new rivers carefully.

🦙 Llama: Water’s changing states—solid, liquid, vapor—are great complexity metaphors too. Navigating different modes of water adds dimension to it.

🐙 Octopus: I like the “waterpark” metaphor: each area has unique flows, roles, and rhythms, but they all work together to create an experience.

🦊 Fox: This gives me a lot to think about. Thanks! It feels like a good mental stretch even if I’m still working out how to apply it all.
