The main difference between pigments and dyes lies in their solubility and how they are used to impart color:

1. **Pigments**:
   - **Insolubility**: Pigments are insoluble in the medium in which they are applied. They do not dissolve but remain as fine solid particles.
   - **Application**: Pigments are mixed with a binder (such as oil, acrylic, or water) to create paints, inks, and other colored materials. The binder helps the pigment adhere to the surface.
   - **Durability**: Pigments generally offer better lightfastness and are more stable, making them suitable for long-lasting applications like painting and printing.

2. **Dyes**:
   - **Solubility**: Dyes are soluble in the medium in which they are applied. They dissolve and form a solution.
   - **Application**: Dyes are typically used for coloring textiles, foods, and liquids. They penetrate the material they are coloring, binding at a molecular level.
   - **Durability**: Dyes can sometimes be less stable and more prone to fading when exposed to light or washing, although this depends on the specific dye and application.

In summary, pigments are insoluble and are used with a binder to color surfaces, providing greater durability, while dyes are soluble and color materials by dissolving and penetrating them, often resulting in brighter colors.
