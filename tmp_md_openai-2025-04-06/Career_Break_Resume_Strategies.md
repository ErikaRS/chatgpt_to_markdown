How can I take off a couple of years without it looking bad on my resume? I am a technology leader in software, at the director level at large tech companies or the VP/CTO level at small to medium

Taking a couple of years off and ensuring it doesn't "look bad" on your resume can actually be an opportunity to show thoughtful career development and life balance. Here are a few strategies you can use to manage this transition smoothly and present it as an asset:

### 1. **Frame It as a Sabbatical or Intentional Time for Growth**
   - **Career Break for Personal Development**: You can frame the time off as a sabbatical for personal growth, focusing on skills that can benefit your long-term career goals. For example, learning a new language, deepening technical expertise, or gaining certifications in emerging areas can demonstrate that you remained engaged and committed to development during the break.
   - **Pursue Passion Projects**: Highlight any meaningful side projects or interests you explored, such as consulting, advising startups, working on open-source projects, or contributing to industry events. Showcasing leadership outside of a corporate role can reinforce your skills.

### 2. **Present the Break as a Strategic Pivot**
   - **Focus on Strategic Initiatives**: Position the time as a way to prepare for a new strategic direction. For example, maybe you took time to better understand an emerging technology (e.g., AI/ML or sustainability in tech) or used the time to write articles, research, or even teach, all of which can position you as a more well-rounded leader.
   - **Highlight Consulting or Advisory Roles**: If you did any consulting, mentorship, or advisory work during your time off, make sure to mention it. Emphasize that these experiences expanded your perspective and continued to develop your leadership skills.

### 3. **Relate Your Experience to Benefits for Future Roles**
   - **Renewed Energy and Fresh Perspectives**: You can present this break as a source of renewed energy, stating that you took time to reflect on the challenges you've faced, gained new insights, and are now returning with even greater clarity on how to tackle the challenges facing tech leaders.
   - **Avoiding Burnout**: As a technology leader, you can talk candidly about the importance of avoiding burnout—how taking time off allowed you to recharge so you can continue to make impactful decisions without the detriments of burnout affecting your judgment or vision.

### 4. **Use Narrative in Your LinkedIn and Resume**
   - **LinkedIn Summary Update**: In your LinkedIn summary, tell a story about your career journey. Acknowledge your sabbatical as a conscious choice and emphasize what you gained from it. For example: "After X years in executive roles, I took time to focus on personal growth, expand my perspective through consulting, and deepen my understanding of emerging tech to come back ready to contribute with even greater focus."
   - **Brief Mention on Your Resume**: You can briefly list your time off under work history with a title like "Sabbatical" or "Career Break," adding a bullet or two about how you used that time for exploration, learning, or contribution to the community.

### 5. **Prepare Your Explanation for Interviews**
   - When interviewers ask about the break, be candid and positive. Make sure to connect it to something relevant to the company or role. For example: "I took a couple of years off to focus on areas I hadn’t had the time to invest in, such as [specific area], and I feel it’s made me a more effective leader, especially in the face of [type of challenges relevant to the role]."

### **Human Connection Aspect**
To maintain your network and build new bonds during your time away:
- **Stay Visible in Industry Circles**: Consider attending conferences, joining panels, or even hosting a workshop. This way, people in your professional network will see that you're still actively contributing to the tech community.
- **Mentoring and Volunteering**: You could take on mentorship roles within tech organizations or do some work in the nonprofit sector. These activities not only enrich your skills but help you give back to the community and build trust with others.

Do any of these approaches resonate with you? Reflecting on what you want to get out of the break might help you frame the narrative you’re most comfortable with when it's time to explain it on your resume or in interviews. 

Once we've discussed this more, I'd also encourage you to reflect on how this plan aligns with your goals—what did you learn or gain that you might carry forward?
