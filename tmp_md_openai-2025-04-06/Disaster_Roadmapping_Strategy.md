Start a draft with this text:

Imagine standing in front of your team, steeling yourself to announce the unthinkable: you’re sunsetting a product you promised to maintain—a product users rely on daily. Cue the collective gasp! But instead of spiraling into dread, you ask yourself, “What would I do if I really had to shut it down?” Suddenly, you find yourself charting an unconventional roadmap: frank conversations, graceful exits, even clever solutions for users to keep on truckin’. Not so scary after all.

Inspired by an anecdote in Ben Horowitz’s The Hard Thing About Hard Things, disaster roadmapping turns the big “what if” on its head. You’re playing out hypothetical worst-case scenarios, not to stew in fear, but to discover bold, resilient moves hiding behind it. Imagine you’re ending the product with class and transparency—then ask, “Could I do any of this now, while the product’s still kicking?” More often than not, the answer is yes. By disaster roadmapping proactively, you find yourself building communication bridges, laying out clever contingencies, and even sketching out a soft landing for users who may someday need it.

Embracing disaster roadmapping gives you a secret advantage. Pick a product on shaky ground, fast-forward to the dreaded “shutdown” scenario, and map out the steps you’d take to keep your users delighted (or at least not panicked!). Applying these steps now doesn’t just bolster resilience; it reassures users that no matter what, you’ve got their back—whether they’re full steam ahead with your current offerings or along for the ride wherever your roadmap leads next.

This draft captures the essence of disaster roadmapping and its proactive benefits. Would you like me to expand on any part or adjust the tone? Also, who do you envision as the audience for this? We could adapt the message to make it more engaging for them.

Change the first paragraph to be more like "You are" than "imagine"

I've adjusted the first paragraph to be more direct, using "You are" rather than "Imagine." Let me know if you'd like any other changes or if you'd like to refine the tone further. Also, take a moment later to reflect on how this approach might help in other challenging scenarios you face.

### User - 2024-11-10 13:50:52

Keep it centered on the example, but make the flow of the opening paragraph more like: "Situation is dire. You need to do something drastic. You are considering the unthinkable: because of unmaintainable..."

I've modified the opening paragraph to establish a more direct and urgent tone, focusing on the dire situation and drastic actions. Let me know if this aligns with your vision or if you'd like further adjustments. Also, remember to reflect on how this approach could aid in making proactive decisions in challenging scenarios.

### User - 2024-11-10 14:01:51

The last paragraph is too rooted in the example. Change the last paragraph to be applicable in a more general sense. Build on something like "Challenging scenarios will come up in both work and personal life. By facing the worst case scenario directly and understanding how you would do it if you really happened, you can... something something that feels different than what's already been said"

    {
      "pattern": ".*",
      "replacement": "The situation is dire. Operating costs are spiraling for a frequently used acquisition you publicly promised to keep running. If this continues, you need to do something drastic. You're considering axing it. You look for other alternatives, but nothing comes to mind. Instead, it is like your mind is stuck on the worst-case scenario. But instead of spiraling into dread, you ask yourself, “What would we do if we really had to shut it down?” Still with fear, but with the clarity of acceptance, you get ideas for charting an unconventional roadmap: frank conversations, graceful exits, even clever solutions for users to keep on truckin’. Then, the real insight occurs: you don't have to wait for things to become dire to make some of these adjustments. You can implement them now... and maybe avoid turning the product down.\n\nInspired by anecdotes in Ben Horowitz’s *The Hard Thing About Hard Things*, **disaster roadmapping** turns a scary “what if” on its head. Instead of getting stuck in the emotional baggage of a worst-case scenario, you play it out. How would you actually execute this scenario in the best way possible? Even if you conclude that this is still the only path, it will feel less intimidating when it starts to take on the shape of a concrete plan. And sometimes, you may discover bold, resilient moves.\n\nChallenging scenarios will come up in both work and personal life. By facing the worst-case scenario directly and understanding how you would approach it if it really happened, you gain a sense of control and clarity. Instead of being paralyzed by fear of the unknown, you build a proactive mindset, ready to act and adapt. This process not only uncovers practical steps but also empowers you to make better decisions now, potentially preventing the very crisis you feared. Disaster roadmapping isn't just about preparing for the worst; it's about using that insight to strengthen your approach today, ensuring you’re always a step ahead, whether in your career or personal growth."

I've made the last paragraph more general, focusing on how facing worst-case scenarios can be empowering in both work and personal contexts. Let me know if this captures the broader perspective you were looking for or if you'd like further adjustments. Remember, reflecting on these scenarios later can deepen your understanding and resilience.
