Red light therapy (RLT), also known as low-level light therapy (LLLT), benefits the skin primarily through its effects on cellular processes. Here's how it works and helps:

### Mechanism of Action
Red light penetrates the skin at a depth of about 5–10 millimeters, reaching the dermis and affecting cells in multiple ways:
1. **Stimulation of Mitochondria:** Red light enhances the activity of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures in cells. This leads to increased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy source cells need for repair and regeneration.
2. **Increased Circulation:** Red light improves blood flow in the skin, delivering more oxygen and nutrients while removing waste products.
3. **Reduction of Inflammation:** Red light has anti-inflammatory effects, which can calm irritated or inflamed skin.

### Benefits for Skin
1. **Anti-Aging Effects:**
   - Stimulates collagen production, reducing fine lines and wrinkles.
   - Improves skin elasticity by strengthening fibroblasts (collagen-producing cells).
   - Reduces pigmentation and promotes even skin tone.

2. **Wound Healing and Tissue Repair:**
   - Speeds up the healing of cuts, burns, and other skin injuries.
   - Reduces scar formation by improving tissue remodeling.

3. **Treatment of Acne:**
   - Reduces inflammation associated with acne.
   - May help kill bacteria (e.g., *Propionibacterium acnes*) when combined with blue light therapy.

4. **Reduction of Redness and Irritation:**
   - Helps calm conditions like rosacea by reducing inflammation and strengthening blood vessels.

5. **Improved Skin Texture:**
   - Encourages the turnover of skin cells, leading to a smoother complexion.

### Considerations
- **Safety:** Red light therapy is generally safe and non-invasive, with minimal side effects. Some people may experience temporary redness or sensitivity.
- **Consistency:** Benefits typically require multiple sessions over weeks or months, as it works gradually to improve cellular health.
- **Device Quality:** Results vary based on the device's wavelength (typically 600–650 nm for red light) and power output.

If you're exploring red light therapy, start by determining your skin goals and consulting a dermatologist if you have specific skin concerns or conditions.
