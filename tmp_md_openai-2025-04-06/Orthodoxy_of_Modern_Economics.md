What's the orthodoxy of modern economics?

### Assistant - 2023-05-22 08:44:46

The "orthodoxy" of modern economics largely refers to the mainstream school of thought, known as neoclassical economics. This school of thought is the dominant approach taught in most economics departments around the world. It's characterized by several key assumptions and principles:

1. **Rationality:** This assumes that individuals always make rational choices that maximize their utility or satisfaction. Firms, on the other hand, are assumed to maximize profit.

2. **Methodological Individualism:** The analysis begins with individual decisions and then aggregates these to understand the economy as a whole. The choices and behaviors of individual agents (consumers and firms) determine the outcomes in the markets.

3. **Marginal Analysis:** Decisions are made at the margin. For example, firms decide on the amount of labor to employ or capital to use based on the additional cost and additional benefit of using one more unit (i.e., the marginal cost and marginal benefit).

4. **Equilibrium:** Markets tend towards equilibrium, where supply equals demand.

5. **Efficiency:** In a state of equilibrium, the economy is usually assumed to be operating at a level of efficiency referred to as Pareto efficiency, where it's impossible to make one person better off without making someone else worse off.

6. **The Use of Mathematical Models:** Modern economics heavily relies on mathematical models and statistics to predict and analyze economic behavior and outcomes.

However, it's important to note that these principles have been increasingly challenged since the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Behavioral economics, which attempts to incorporate insights from psychology into economics, is one prominent example. Other branches like institutional economics, post-Keynesian economics, and ecological economics also offer alternatives to the neoclassical orthodoxy.

Furthermore, the neoclassical model has been critiqued for its inability to predict financial crises and its disregard for inequality, environmental sustainability, and other issues that don't neatly fit into its analytical framework. The 21st century has seen an increasing number of voices calling for an overhaul of the economics discipline to make it more responsive to the complexities and challenges of the modern world. As of my last update in September 2021, the shape of these reforms remains a topic of ongoing debate within the field.

What are the main economic viewpoints and what would they think of the economic orthodoxy?

### Assistant - 2023-05-22 08:46:15

Economics, like any field, is home to a range of perspectives that can differ quite significantly from the mainstream orthodoxy. Below are several of the major schools of thought and a broad-brush idea of their perspectives on the economic orthodoxy, which is represented by neoclassical economics.

1. **Neoclassical Economics:** This is the mainstream or "orthodox" school of economics. As discussed in the previous response, it emphasizes rationality, methodological individualism, marginal analysis, equilibrium, and efficiency. It's characterized by a heavy reliance on mathematical models and statistics.

2. **Keynesian Economics:** Developed by John Maynard Keynes, this school emphasizes the role of demand in driving economic activity and the potential for market failures. Keynesians might critique the orthodoxy for underestimating the potential for markets to fail and the need for government intervention. The idea of rational expectations is also disputed by Keynesians who argue that uncertainty can prevent rational decision-making.

3. **Post-Keynesian Economics:** This school expands on Keynesian economics and is often more critical of the mainstream orthodoxy. It emphasizes the importance of effective demand, money, and finance in the economy. They critique neoclassical economics for ignoring realistic features of capitalism, such as uncertainty, power relations, and institutional structures.

4. **Marxist Economics:** Rooted in the work of Karl Marx, this school views economics in terms of class struggle and focuses on labor and capital as the main drivers of value. Marxist economists critique the orthodoxy for its focus on market mechanisms and individual decision-making, arguing that this perspective obscures the systemic issues of exploitation and inequality inherent in capitalism.

5. **Behavioral Economics:** This school applies insights from psychology to economic behavior, challenging the orthodoxy's assumption of perfect rationality. Behavioral economists argue that cognitive biases and other psychological factors can lead individuals to make decisions that deviate from those predicted by standard economic models.

6. **Austrian Economics:** This school emphasizes individualism and sees markets as dynamic and evolving systems. Austrian economists often critique the orthodoxy for relying too heavily on mathematical models, arguing that these can't capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world markets.

7. **Institutional Economics:** This school emphasizes the role of institutions—like laws, norms, and power structures—in shaping economic behavior. Institutional economists might critique the orthodoxy for its methodological individualism, arguing that this perspective overlooks the ways in which institutions and social structures shape individual decisions.

8. **Ecological Economics:** This perspective sees the economy as a subsystem of the larger ecosystem and emphasizes sustainability. Ecological economists critique the orthodoxy for failing to account for environmental costs and the finite nature of natural resources.

Each of these schools of thought offers a unique perspective, and they often critique the economic orthodoxy from different angles. However, there are also overlaps and areas of agreement between them. Moreover, economics is not a static field, and new schools of thought and perspectives continue to emerge.

What should I have asked about this space?

### Assistant - 2023-05-22 08:48:13

You've asked some insightful questions about economic orthodoxy and the various schools of thought in economics. However, there are many other dimensions of this topic that you could explore, such as:

1. **Impacts of different economic theories on policy-making:** You could ask about how these different economic schools of thought have influenced specific policies or economic decisions at the national or global level.

2. **Specific critiques and defenses of neoclassical economics:** It could be interesting to ask about the major criticisms leveled against mainstream economic theory and how its defenders respond to these critiques.

3. **The role of economics in addressing global challenges:** Questions could be asked about the role of economic thinking in addressing major global challenges, such as climate change, income inequality, or sustainable development.

4. **The evolution of economic thought:** You could inquire about the history and evolution of economic thought. How did we arrive at the current "orthodoxy", and what major shifts have occurred over time?

5. **The integration of different economic schools of thought:** How do modern economists integrate insights from various schools of thought? Are there areas where different schools converge or offer complementary perspectives?

6. **The future of economics:** What new directions might economics take in the future, and how might it need to adapt to better address the needs of the 21st century? 

7. **The practical implications of different economic theories:** You could ask about how different economic theories might impact the everyday lives of individuals or businesses. 

These are just a few possibilities. The field of economics is vast and multi-dimensional, and there's a wealth of interesting questions to explore.

What are rare criticisms of the economic orthodoxy?

### Assistant - 2023-05-22 08:49:55

While the economic orthodoxy -- represented by neoclassical economics -- has been subject to a variety of common critiques, including those related to its assumptions of rationality, perfect information, and equilibrium, there are indeed less common, or "rare," criticisms as well. Some of these include:

1. **Too much emphasis on quantification:** Some critics argue that the heavy reliance on mathematical modeling and quantification in neoclassical economics neglects the qualitative aspects of human behavior and social institutions. They argue that not everything can be quantified, and important insights can be lost when we try to fit complex phenomena into neat mathematical models.

2. **Economic Imperialism:** This criticism is based on the expansion of economics into the analysis of non-market behavior and non-economic aspects of life (such as law, family, crime, and social customs) using its standard set of tools (utility maximization, equilibrium, etc.). Critics argue that this can oversimplify and distort the understanding of complex social phenomena.

3. **Lack of attention to ethics and morality:** Some critics argue that the economic orthodoxy often neglects questions of ethics, morality, and social justice. By assuming that individuals act to maximize their own utility, critics say, economics ignores moral considerations that can significantly influence human behavior.

4. **Neglect of Power Relations:** Some critics argue that mainstream economics often overlooks the role of power imbalances in economic relationships, which can significantly affect market outcomes.

5. **Insufficient consideration of ecological limits:** While this critique is becoming more common, it remains underemphasized within mainstream economics. Critics argue that the focus on continuous growth and efficiency fails to acknowledge the finite nature of Earth's resources and the ecological limits to growth.

6. **Economics as a social construct:** Some critics argue that economics is not just a description of reality but also a social construct that influences people's behavior. They argue that economic theories can shape the economy by affecting people's beliefs and expectations.

Remember, even though these criticisms are less common, they can still provide valuable perspectives on the limitations of economic orthodoxy and inspire the development of alternative economic approaches.

What's the orthodoxy of becoming popular on the internet?

### Assistant - 2023-05-22 08:51:22

While there isn't an "orthodoxy" in the strict sense when it comes to becoming popular on the internet, there are several commonly accepted practices and strategies that many successful influencers, brands, and content creators tend to follow:

1. **Consistent and Quality Content:** Regularly sharing high-quality content that resonates with your target audience is crucial. This helps to keep your audience engaged and encourages them to return for more.

2. **Understand Your Audience:** Knowing who your audience is and what they want to see is vital. This includes understanding their interests, demographic characteristics, and online habits.

3. **Unique Value Proposition:** Successful online personalities often have a unique aspect or value proposition that sets them apart from others. This could be a distinctive style, niche topic, unique skills, or a compelling personal story.

4. **Engage with Your Audience:** Engaging with your audience—responding to comments, holding live Q&A sessions, or asking for their input on content—can help to build a loyal community.

5. **Optimize for Search and Algorithms:** Understanding how search engines and social media algorithms work can help ensure that your content gets discovered. This often involves using appropriate keywords, hashtags, and engaging thumbnails or titles.

6. **Collaborate:** Collaborating with other content creators can help to expand your audience. This could involve guest posting, shout-outs, or joint projects.

7. **Promote Across Different Platforms:** Using multiple platforms can help to reach a broader audience. For example, you might use YouTube for long-form videos, Instagram for images and short videos, Twitter for quick updates, and a blog for more detailed content.

8. **Stay Up to Date:** The digital landscape changes rapidly, and it's important to keep up with the latest trends, platform updates, and audience preferences.

9. **Patience and Persistence:** Building an online presence often takes time. It's important to be patient and persistent, and not get discouraged by slow progress.

10. **Ethics and Respect:** This involves respecting the privacy and rights of others, acknowledging and correcting mistakes, and avoiding deceptive or manipulative practices.

Remember, while these strategies can increase your chances of becoming popular on the internet, there's no guaranteed formula for success. The internet is a diverse and dynamic space, and what works for one person or brand might not work for another. Success often involves a combination of strategic planning, creativity, hard work, and a bit of luck.

What's the non-obvious parts of the orthodoxy? The things that would surprise even skilled practitioners.

### Assistant - 2023-05-22 08:53:47

Even for skilled practitioners, certain aspects of online popularity might not be immediately obvious, largely due to the complex and ever-changing nature of the internet. Some of these non-obvious elements might include:

1. **Algorithmic Transparency:** Even experts may not fully understand how the algorithms that drive visibility on platforms work. These algorithms are typically proprietary and are frequently updated, which can lead to sudden changes in the reach and popularity of content.

2. **The 'Viral' Factor:** Creating content that goes viral can often be unpredictable and surprising, even to skilled practitioners. What resonates with audiences can be highly variable and often content goes viral due to unforeseen factors.

3. **The Role of Timing:** The timing of posts can have a big impact on their visibility and engagement. However, finding the 'perfect' time can be tricky, as it can depend on factors like the platform, the audience's location, and current events.

4. **Impact of Small Design Choices:** Sometimes, very small design choices, like the color scheme of a thumbnail or the specific wording of a title, can have a surprisingly large impact on audience engagement.

5. **Psychology of Sharing:** Understanding why people share content can be complex and non-obvious. It's not just about the quality of the content, but also how it makes the audience feel, and whether they think it will be valuable or interesting to their own followers.

6. **Burnout:** Achieving and maintaining popularity on the internet often requires consistent content creation, which can lead to burnout. Skilled practitioners might be surprised at how taxing this can be.

7. **The Impact of Negative Attention:** Sometimes negative attention or controversy can actually increase a person's or brand's visibility. However, this can be a double-edged sword and needs to be handled very carefully.

8. **Adaptability:** The internet is a rapidly changing environment. What worked a few months ago might not work now. Skilled practitioners often have to adapt quickly and continuously learn new skills and strategies.

Understanding these non-obvious elements can help to navigate the complexities of achieving popularity on the internet. However, given the dynamic nature of the digital landscape, there will always be surprises and new lessons to learn.

How is the orthodoxy of social media generation incorrect?

### Assistant - 2023-05-22 08:54:51

There's been a rising critique about the common advice given to become popular on the internet or social media, with various reasons suggesting the "orthodoxy" might not always be correct or beneficial:

1. **Overemphasis on Frequency:** The orthodoxy often stresses the importance of regular, frequent content posting. However, this could lead to a quantity-over-quality approach, which might dilute the value of the content or lead to creator burnout.

2. **Rationality of Algorithms:** The belief that if you optimize your content according to algorithmic rules, you're guaranteed to gain visibility and popularity, is not always true. Algorithms are complex, constantly changing, and what works for one content creator or audience might not work for another.

3. **Niche Content:** While focusing on niche content can help establish an identity, it may also limit creativity and diversity of content, potentially trapping creators in a specific format or theme, even when their interests evolve.

4. **Chasing Trends:** The advice to always jump on the latest trend can sometimes lead to content that feels forced, unoriginal, or irrelevant to the creator's brand or audience.

5. **Underestimation of Luck:** There's often a lot of chance involved in what gets popular on the internet, which isn't acknowledged in the "follow these steps to success" formula.

6. **Ignoring Mental Health Impacts:** The pressure to constantly engage with audience and produce content can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout, which isn't often discussed in the advice given to aspiring internet personalities.

7. **Ethical Concerns:** The quest for online popularity can sometimes encourage behaviors that are ethically dubious, such as clickbait, misinformation, or invasion of privacy, which is often not acknowledged in the orthodoxy.

8. **Overemphasis on Metrics:** Focusing too much on likes, shares, and follower counts can sometimes distract from the real value of the content or the community that's built around it.

The key takeaway here is that the prevailing "orthodoxy" should be adapted to each individual's or brand's unique context and goals. Not every tactic will be appropriate or effective for everyone, and the quality and authenticity of content, along with the well-being of the creator, should remain central considerations.
