One more planning item for today, this one more philosophical.

When I think of the Strategic Goals + Key Projects for Search Suite and Platform (and somewhat Infrastructure), here's how I've been thinking about them. I submit these for your consideration as you're thinking about "why this, not that?"
Stop the bleeding:
Fix egregious issues with the user and admin experience
Reduce the surface area of our systems to be maintainable with smaller teams.
Unlock the value we already have latent in the product (or, more snarkily, "Ship the product we sell"): 
We have so much value locked into the product today that is hard for users to access and discover. How can we make that front and center? 
We have quality paper cuts that make it hard to realize that value even when users know it's there. We need to improve our product to make quality front and center.

Not all of the work we're doing will fit into this bucket. E.g. work for specific customers or work to support Cody. However,

:telescope: **Strategic Planning for the Quarter**

One more thought for today, as we delve into our planning, albeit with a philosophical lens.

As I contemplate the Strategic Goals and Key Projects for Search Suite, Platform, and to some extent, Infrastructure, I'd like you to consider my perspective. It might help answer the question, "why this, not that?"

**1. Stop the Bleeding:**
   - Address pressing issues affecting both user and admin experiences.
   - Streamline our systems to be manageable even with leaner teams.

**2. Unlock Latent Value:**
   - There's immense potential within our product that is currently obscured or difficult for users to leverage. Our aim? Bring that value to the forefront.
   - Address those "quality paper cuts" that hinder users from experiencing the full value, even when they're aware of it. Elevate our product's quality to the forefront.

While these are the primary goals, it's important to note that not all tasks will align perfectly. For instance, certain tasks might be tailored for specific customers or to support initiatives like Cody.

how do tech startups assess performance without the overhead of big-tech-company style performance reviews?

### Assistant - 2023-09-29 09:51:25

Tech startups, especially in their early stages, often prioritize agility and flexibility over formal bureaucratic processes. While big-tech-company style performance reviews can provide structure and clear evaluation metrics, they may also come with a lot of overhead that isn't suitable for a fast-paced startup environment. Here are some alternative methods startups use to assess performance:

1. **Regular One-on-Ones:** Regular check-ins between employees and their managers can provide a platform for feedback, goal setting, and discussion of challenges. These meetings can be informal and focused on two-way communication.

2. **Goal and Objective Tracking:** Startups often use frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to set, track, and measure goals on a quarterly basis. This approach ensures alignment with the company's strategic objectives and provides clear performance indicators.

3. **Peer Feedback:** Encouraging team members to provide feedback to each other can offer diverse perspectives on performance. This can be done informally or through structured processes, like 360-degree feedback.

4. **Project Post-mortems:** After completing significant projects, teams can gather to discuss what went well, what didn't, and lessons learned. This can offer insights into both individual and team performance.

5. **Customer Feedback:** Especially for customer-facing roles, feedback from customers can be invaluable in assessing performance. 

6. **Self-assessment:** Encourage employees to reflect on their own performance, challenges, and achievements. This can lead to self-awareness and proactive efforts to improve.

7. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Even without a formal review process, startups can define and track KPIs for different roles. These provide quantifiable metrics of success.

8. **Ad hoc Feedback:** In the dynamic environment of a startup, feedback often happens on the fly. Cultivating an open culture where feedback is welcomed and given constructively can be very effective.

9. **Culture Fit Assessments:** Startups may also consider how well an employee fits with the company culture, values, and mission. This can be as critical as evaluating skills and accomplishments.

10. **Use of Tools and Software:** There are many lightweight performance management tools designed for startups that offer features like goal tracking, feedback, and peer reviews without the complexity of enterprise solutions.

11. **Flexible Review Cycles:** Instead of annual reviews, startups might opt for more frequent but less intensive evaluations, like quarterly or bi-annual check-ins.

Regardless of the method chosen, the key is to ensure that the process is transparent, fair, and aligned with the company's goals. It's also vital to foster a culture where feedback is seen as an opportunity for growth and development, not just criticism.
