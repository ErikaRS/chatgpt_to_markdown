According to Douglas Adams' science fiction series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is "42". However, it's important to note that this answer was meant to be a joke and a commentary on the absurdity of expecting a single answer to such a grand question. In reality, the question of the meaning of life and the universe is a complex and subjective one, and there is no definitive answer that applies to everyone.
