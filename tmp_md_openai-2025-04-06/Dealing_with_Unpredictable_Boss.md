What to do when your boss is so wishy washy with commitments that they may as well be a serial liar. The intent is not there but all the negative downsides of lack of predictability and no basis for trust are there.

That’s a tough and emotionally taxing situation. When someone in a position of power—like a boss—is consistently inconsistent, it chips away at the foundations of trust, even if it’s not out of malice or manipulation. You're not alone in this; many people struggle with leaders who are *unintentionally* unreliable. Let’s unpack it in a way that helps you not just cope, but possibly steer things toward a more manageable path.

### 🔍 Brief Skills & Context Overview
To engage well with this complexity, you'll want to draw on a few overlapping areas:

- **Expectation Management**: How to anchor around clarity when others don't provide it.
- **Trust Calibration**: How to work with someone whose intent is good but follow-through is weak.
- **Boundary Setting**: How to protect your own capacity and credibility in a low-trust environment.
- **Upward Management**: Strategic nudging without appearing confrontational or needy.
- **Organizational Signaling**: Understanding the cost their inconsistency has on others and the system.

### 🧠 What’s Going On Here?

You're describing a leader whose verbal commitments don’t translate into reliable action. This is often due to:

- **Over-optimism or conflict avoidance**: They say yes to too many things or tell different people different things to please them in the moment.
- **Poor executive function**: They might not be tracking their promises or structuring their work around delivery.
- **Shifting priorities**: They may be operating in chaos and don’t realize the downstream impact of their unpredictability.
- **Emotional immaturity or indecision**: A lack of clarity in their own thinking means they commit prematurely or inconsistently.

Regardless of the *reason*, the *result* is the same: you can’t plan, rely, or hold them to account in a normal way.

### ✅ What You Can Do

Here’s a tiered approach that balances empathy, self-protection, and influence:

#### 1. **Document and Reflect Back Gently**
- Start tracking what’s said and when. Don’t weaponize it—use it as shared memory.
- "Just looping back on what we discussed last Tuesday—where we agreed you'd talk to [X] this week. Still your plan?"

#### 2. **Time-box and Reconfirm**
- “If we don’t get alignment by [date], I’ll proceed with the default plan we talked about earlier.”
- This gives them room to act, but also sets a clear boundary for you.

#### 3. **Use the “Assume Best Intent, Ask for Help” Frame**
- “I know you’ve got a lot going on, and I’m trying to make sure I don’t misinterpret anything or get out of sync. Would it help if I sent a quick recap after key discussions to make it easier to track?”

#### 4. **Decentralize Dependence**
- Reduce reliance on them for progress where possible.
- Build coalitions with peers or adjacent leaders who *do* operate reliably.
- Use the phrase “in the absence of a strong direction, I’m moving forward with [X] based on what we last discussed.”

#### 5. **Escalate Softly, Signal System Cost**
If it’s truly hurting team trust, delivery, or morale, it’s fair to raise that *as a pattern*, not a personal critique:
- “One of the challenges I’m seeing is that when decisions aren’t durable, it creates rework and erodes confidence downstream. How can we reduce the thrash without putting more burden on you?”

---

### 🛑 What Not to Do

- **Don’t just pick up the slack indefinitely**: It breeds resentment and hides the problem.
- **Don’t confront them with “you always say things and don’t follow through”**: That triggers defensiveness, even if it’s true.
- **Don’t assume they’re beyond change**: Sometimes, a few well-placed nudges and scaffolds can help them behave more reliably without needing to become a different person.

### ⚡ Metaskill: Trust Without Dependence
What you’re building here is the ability to work with someone *without* trusting their follow-through, while still being constructive and influential. This is a core leadership skill—especially at senior levels—because not everyone *can* be dependable, but they’re still part of the system you have to navigate.

---

Would you like help drafting a specific message or framing a recent example? That might help translate this into something immediately actionable.

And as always: **take time to reflect on this later**. Think about how your own sense of trust, fairness, and clarity plays into your leadership style—and how you want to show up when others are failing to do the same.
