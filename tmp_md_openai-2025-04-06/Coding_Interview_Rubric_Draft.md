I am developing a rubric for coding interviews. One dimension should be level: IC1 - IC5 where the levels follow the Radford definitions and are more specifically defined per row. The other dimension should be "doesn't meet the bar", "good", "great" and should describe what interviewers should look for both in terms of code and test quality and in terms of the candidate's approach. Draft that rubric.

Level definitions

|  | **All levels** | **L1** | **L2** | **L3** | **L4** | **L5** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Impact** | Directly contributes to achieving the company’s strategic goals and long term success. | Delivers clearly defined projects of small to medium technical risk. | Clarifies project scope and delivers projects of medium to high technical risk. | Delivers highly technical, open-ended, potentially ambiguously defined projects. | Deliver projects with high technical and organizational risk. | Drives and delivers top-level company initiatives with only broad strategic guidance. |
| **Scope** | Has high productivity and output, with frequent and meaningful commits.

Ships regularly.

Writes high-quality, well-tested, well-documented, maintainable code that aligns with the style and practices of the codebase.

Writes high-quality documentation in order to solicit and receive the best feedback on proposals. | Delivers clearly defined projects of small to medium technical risk. | Primarily focuses on their team’s code and architecture. Pulls on broader knowledge of Sourcegraph. Strong generalist skill set. Starting to develop some areas of expertise. | Regularly works on components outside their most common tech stack. Demonstrates some specialized skill sets on top of their general knowledge. | Recognizes overarching technical issues beyond their immediate domain and suggests solutions.

Goes into whatever codebase is needed to solve the problem. | Applies technical expertise to the company’s most challenging problems.

Influences the company’s overall technical direction.

Uses domain expertise to deliver important differentiators for the company.

Provides solutions that are examples for others to follow. |
| **Execution** | Seeks out work, rather than waiting for work.

Applies diligence through the entire software lifecycle: planning, coding, documenting, shipping, demoing, supporting, and improving your software over time.

Finds simple, correct solutions. Implements them in the expected time (or escalates early). Iterates as needed.

Seeks out opportunities to simplify and streamline our current systems. Considerings the broader implications of changes.

Enhances the maintainability, resilience, and performance of existing systems. Understands their importance to our business continuity.

Can work remotely & async. Knows how to manage time, work, and communication. | Delivers clearly defined projects of small to medium technical risk. | Identifies gaps in the overall project, not just the parts within their scope. | Identifies gaps in the product experience as well as engineering gaps. Identifies areas ripe for improvement. | Clearly translate between engineering goals and business objectives.

Identifies, proposes, and implements solutions to fill the gaps between engineering efforts and goals. | Brings conviction about what problems we should solve.

Identifies and implements ways that engineering can help advance business goals.

Drives external alignment when it helps to advance our business goals. |
| **Teamwork** | Escalates early and efficiently when blocked, stuck, overloaded, or sees a better way to achieve our goals.

Does not gate-keep. Accelerates and unblocks colleagues.

Communicates thoughtfully and proactively to keep stakeholders informed and identify risks. | Generally works with a handful of people, primarily engineers, PM, and design partners on their team. | Actively contributes to a collaborative and respectful team culture.

Collaborates across teams, focused on their direct areas of work. | Gives feedback which influences the work of others.

Gathers input from customers and users to guide decisions.

Actively enables or mentors other engineers. | Influences the direction of the engineering organization.

Uplifts entire teams. Actively shapes the engineering team’s culture.

Helps others understand the company direction, detects misalignments, and provides missing context. | Expertise is recognized across the company. Actively shares insights, upleveling others.

Works with Engineering and Product leadership to ensure alignment between engineering and business goals.

Identifies the right project owners. Hands off projects without just dropping them in another team’s lap. |

### Assistant - 2024-12-13 13:53:06

Here are a few areas where the expectations might be overly ambitious for a 45-minute interview, along with suggestions to adjust them:

### IC1
- **Tests are comprehensive, including edge cases.**  
  *Why it’s too much:* It can be difficult to expect a candidate to cover every edge case, especially in time-constrained settings.  
  *Adjustment:* Change to “Tests cover critical cases and demonstrate awareness of edge cases.”

### IC2
- **Thinks strategically about edge cases and long-term code maintainability.**  
  *Why it’s too much:* Strategic thinking about maintainability and future-proofing might require time to discuss tradeoffs and implementations that go beyond the scope of a short coding task.  
  *Adjustment:* Change to “Demonstrates awareness of edge cases and discusses maintainability when prompted.”

### IC3
- **Thinks beyond unit tests and discusses e2e and integration tests.**  
  *Why it’s too much:* Discussing test strategies like end-to-end or integration testing may require significant context about the system, which is hard to provide in an interview.  
  *Adjustment:* Change to “Mentions other testing strategies (e.g., e2e, integration) when relevant.”

### IC4/IC5
- **Code sets a standard for others to follow.**  
  *Why it’s too much:* While demonstrating high-quality work is feasible, expecting the code to “set a standard” could be unrealistic without the candidate having full context on team norms and practices.  
  *Adjustment:* Change to “Code demonstrates high-quality practices and clarity, setting a strong example.”

- **Navigates high ambiguity and complexity with confidence.**  
  *Why it’s too much:* Handling high ambiguity might be difficult to assess in a short interview unless the problem is explicitly designed for it.  
  *Adjustment:* Change to “Demonstrates confidence in tackling complex problems and articulates their thought process clearly.”

Would you like to revise these further or discuss how to design the interview tasks to better align with these expectations?

### Assistant - 2024-12-13 13:56:55

Here are areas where the draft might still ask too much for a 45-minute coding interview focused on a self-contained problem:

---

### **IC2**
- **Tests are thorough and well-structured.**
  - *Why it's too much:* While candidates can write basic and some edge-case tests, expecting a well-structured suite in limited time might be overkill.
  - *Suggestion:* Change to “Tests cover key scenarios and demonstrate reasonable thought about structure.”

- **Demonstrates awareness of edge cases and discusses maintainability when prompted.**
  - *Why it's too much:* Candidates may not naturally discuss maintainability unless specifically asked, and even then, this is a lot for a time-boxed problem.
  - *Suggestion:* Change to “Considers edge cases and touches on maintainability when asked.”

---

### **IC3**
- **Tests demonstrate awareness of edge cases and at least discusses performance implications.**
  - *Why it's too much:* Performance implications may be difficult to assess in a coding problem unless the problem is explicitly performance-focused.
  - *Suggestion:* Change to “Tests demonstrate awareness of edge cases and mention performance only if the problem involves it.”

- **Mentions other testing strategies (e.g., e2e, integration) when relevant.**
  - *Why it's too much:* E2E or integration tests are often out of scope for self-contained problems.
  - *Suggestion:* Remove this, as it’s more appropriate for higher-level discussions.

---

### **IC4 / IC5**
- **Tests demonstrate exceptional foresight and reliability.**
  - *Why it's too much:* Exceptional foresight in tests may require significant domain understanding or context not provided in the interview.
  - *Suggestion:* Change to “Tests are well-considered and robust within the scope of the problem.”

- **Considers technical choices in the context of how it will be used.**
  - *Why it's too much:* This assumes the candidate has insight into broader system requirements or user scenarios, which is unlikely in a self-contained problem.
  - *Suggestion:* Change to “Explains technical choices and considers practical implications.”

---

### General Observation:
- The **Great** category for all levels often assumes candidates will articulate broader implications, scalability, or maintainability spontaneously. These are better assessed through targeted follow-up questions rather than expected as part of their organic solution.

---

Let me know if you'd like more tailored edits or if you'd like to rethink how to make the rubric align even more with specific interview scenarios!

### Analysis of Progression and Delta

#### IC1
- **Progression:**
  - The jump from "Doesn't Meet the Bar" to "Good" is clear: improvement in correctness, maintainability, and basic testing. The candidate transitions from struggling to break down problems to solving them without excessive hints.
  - The jump from "Good" to "Great" emphasizes idiomatic code, critical test coverage, and efficiency in problem-solving. There’s a clear elevation in both the quality of the output and the candidate's adaptability.
- **Delta Between Levels:**
  - Clear distinctions in testing: "Basic cases" (Good) to "Critical cases and edge cases" (Great).
  - Thought process explanation in "Good" becomes "Great explanations and adaptability" in "Great."

#### IC2
- **Progression:**
  - From "Doesn't Meet the Bar" to "Good": improved code readability, testing scope, and problem-solving. Debugging and iteration capabilities also mark the transition.
  - From "Good" to "Great": a focus on code robustness, efficiency, and thorough testing. A more strategic view of problem-solving and maintainability appears.
- **Delta Between Levels:**
  - Testing is the clearest delta: from “covering common cases and edge cases” (Good) to “reasonable thought about structure and excellent coverage” (Great).
  - Problem-solving shifts from “solid” (Good) to “clear and precise solutions” (Great), indicating a focus on refinement.

#### IC3
- **Progression:**
  - From "Doesn't Meet the Bar" to "Good": marked by clarity and appropriateness of code structure, stronger testing, and proactive ambiguity handling.
  - From "Good" to "Great": emphasizes elegance, scalability, and foresight in testing. Communication and tradeoff discussions become critical.
- **Delta Between Levels:**
  - Code quality moves from "appropriate for the problem" (Good) to "elegant and scalable" (Great).
  - Testing improves from "strong awareness" (Good) to "comprehensive foresight" (Great).

#### IC4 / IC5
- **Progression:**
  - From "Doesn't Meet the Bar" to "Good": code quality, testing, and tradeoff explanation improve significantly. Awareness of scalability and maintainability emerges.
  - From "Good" to "Great": leadership-level skills in code practices, test robustness, and aligning technical decisions with broader implications are required.
- **Delta Between Levels:**
  - Testing evolves from "high-quality and well-tested" (Good) to "robust, well-considered, and strategic testing practices" (Great).
  - Problem-solving expands from balanced solutions (Good) to confidence in high ambiguity and articulate decision-making (Great).

### Areas to Improve Progression and Clarity
1. **IC2 - Testing:** 
   - The transition from “consider edge cases” (Good) to “excellent coverage” (Great) might feel unclear without examples of what “excellent” means.
   - Suggestion: Define “excellent” or emphasize structure rather than coverage.

2. **IC3 - Foresight in Testing:**
   - While "comprehensive and demonstrate foresight" (Great) is a strong progression, it might feel redundant compared to "appropriate for the problem" (Good).
   - Suggestion: Highlight testing scalability or adaptability (e.g., consideration for future system changes).

3. **IC4/IC5 - Broader Context:**
   - "Considers practical implications" (Great) vs. "Proposes balanced solutions" (Good) could be too subtle without examples.
   - Suggestion: Expand "practical implications" to include alignment with business or organizational goals.

### Overall Assessment
The progression from “Doesn't Meet the Bar” to “Good” and then to “Great” is clear across levels, with distinct areas of improvement highlighted in testing, code quality, and problem-solving. The delta between levels is mostly clear, but some phrases could be more specific to avoid ambiguity in expectations, particularly for higher levels. Would you like to refine any specific sections further?
