Make this a bit more concise:
Hello! This is a great question and timely as product focused planning for the May release starts next week. While we don't yet whether or not sharable links will be a feature we work on in May, it's a great project for us to consider. As @joe alluded to, I know @rob will make sure this on is on our list to consider. (That said, access permissions on code make this a non-trivial feature today since being logged in is how we ensure that the viewer has access to view the code at all.)

We've also been thinking about how to enable sharing more generally. One thing we've focused on there is making sure we've revamped the blob view and code navigation functionality more before we do that (work in progress). Our thinking is that before we start driving more folks to a particular destination, we should make sure that where they end up is high quality.

All that said, in our December planning session we agreed that collaborative features like sharing are a key differentiator for us. Not only do they help us grow, but unlike many things Sourcegraph can do, sharing is something that IDEs are not well suited for today.

Sure, here's a more concise version:

Hello! As we begin planning for the May release next week, we're considering adding sharable links, as suggested by @joe and @rob. However, it's not confirmed for May, partly due to the complexities involving access permissions and login requirements for code viewing.

We're also working on enhancing our sharing capabilities overall, with a current focus on improving the blob view and code navigation. We believe it's important to ensure these areas are high-quality before increasing traffic to them.

In our December planning session, we recognized that collaborative features like sharing are vital for our growth and differentiation, especially since they're not typically well-handled by IDEs. 

Just letting @Peter Guy know as well.
