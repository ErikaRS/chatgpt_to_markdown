I exceeded expectations for my level over the past 12 months (10 months really since I joined in April). I started as the manager of 3 deeply technical teams responsible for critical areas of the product. I quickly got up to speed after joining and helped the team deliver significant value. I encouraged incremental delivery and fostered a culture that prioritizes customer value through sustainable engineering.


On a personal note, the past 10 months stretched me as a manager. I had to learn to make an impact on multiple deeply technical teams, many of which had expertise I did not possess. I leveraged my experience and technical background to shape team decisions while I gradually got up to speed technically. I cultivated a culture of trust and customer-focused decision-making.


As a manager here, I need to drive:
· Individual growth - enabling engineers to excel and improve
· Team success - helping teams work better and achieve more together
· Product impact - delivering key initiatives and driving customer impact
· Organizational impact - finding ways to improve all teams




Here are some highlights in these areas:


Individual Growth
· Challenged and pushed technical leads (Julie, Erik, and Varun) to delegate more and consider bigger picture impacts.
· Engaged with all engineers in career planning, setting goals with most on how to enhance their skills.
· Provided direct feedback regularly, encouraging engineers to think about the "why" of their work and ensure meaningful contributions.


Team Success
· Transitioned teams to a sprint process, leading to higher quality results and fewer long-term projects.
· Instituted team retrospectives to ensure feedback was heard and enabled each team to optimize itself.
· Communicated team goals and progress clearly, aiding teams in creating clear backlogs through effort/impact processes, making trade-offs easier to describe to leadership and driving high-impact work.


Product Impact
· Refocused and aligned the Graph team efforts with the Code Search team, ensuring a joint commitment on the new code graph API, leading to cleaner code and enabling the syntactic feature.
· Engaged deeply with the Stripe trial, helping structure priorities for the Graph team, resulting in landing the deal.
· The Source team delivered several top-priority customer requests, including critical features for Mathworks and Nvidia, explaining the "why" behind the work to the team.
· The Search Platform team drove the context API work, improving Cody context and enhancing key search features.


Organizational Impact
· Managed and delivered the multi-tenant initiative, a cross-team project involving various disciplines. Developed the project plan, facilitated high-quality decision-making, and ensured local MT mode integration for faster iteration. This project required extensive technical and product expertise to deliver a well-scoped solution, showcasing my strength in handling large, complex, and interconnected projects.
· Helped implement the organization change from GitHub to Linear, engaging multiple parties and pushing for commitment, resulting in increased clarity across product teams.
· Drove the technical deep dive series, turning tribal knowledge into accessible information for new and existing employees, receiving positive feedback.




In addition, I am committed to engaging directly in the code and making opportunistic changes. This keeps me grounded and ensures I understand key components at a low level.


Over the past year, I drove individual items with direct customer impact. A few highlights:


Key Individual Technical Contributions
· Hack/Pkl/Magik language support - helped unblock Slack from using SG.
· Wrote OpenCtx provider for AzureDevOps to learn about the initiative and expand its scope.
· Updated SCIP-Dotnet, leveraging my .NET knowledge, and met with customers on adoption.
· Fixed Perforce navigation issues for a more native experience, benefiting Mathworks and other customers.




Growth Areas
· Provide more direct and honest feedback, building trust with engineers to ensure it is well-received.
· Balance focus effectively between different teams and projects, ensuring all receive support even when one project demands significant time.

Assessment:
It feels like Matt has been here much longer than three months, in the best of ways!
He's already having a huge impact on the team. It's a team of high performers with large output, but connecting that clearly to broader company goals and having a predictable cadence were lacking.
Matt has brought a much-needed level of alignment and cadence to the team.
He is also doing a great job of extending his influence to the broader company. He was deeply involved in the Linear proof of concept and migration, has been working on tech talks, and working with TS to improve clarity.


Next Up:
We're going to continue to have a lot of change as we move towards having one Cody+Code Search product. I want Matt to continue helping the team set the direction in a way that balances supporting our current customers/product and helps move us towards a post-unification world.
Beyond the team, I would love to see Matt continue to help influence our engineering culture.

This quarter Matt has led the Product Platform teams in finishing up some long lingering work, delivering many small but critical-to-customer improvements, and helping the team prioritize to ensure that their work is aligned with company priorities and structured toward making demonstrable progress. Of especial note is his and the team's contributions to both the Stripe PoC and the Mathworks expansion.


Next quarter
The big focus areas for next quarter will be:
Multi-tenant private code: Making sure there is alignment, ensuring staffing (including working across teams to get contributions where appropriate), and making sure the team is able to show progress with incremental milestones.
Graph: Delivering syntactic indexing for Java and start expanding from there. Continuing to improve the SCIP oriented graph API based on feedback from the Code Search team and users.
Support: Continue to help the team strike the right balance between delivering on support requests and not letting them take over everything.
Team development: The Product Platform is fairly senior, so helping people understand what growth looks like and helping them find opportunities will be critical. Also, the teams can continue to grow in their shift to more iterative working styles.

Matt created a wonderful goal setting exercise, where over the course of several sessions he really got to know me and my career history and the traits I wanted out of the next phase of my career without passing any judgement. I created a set of ambitious goals in concert with him, and he's helping to hold me accountable to get there. It's been great working with him, and I really appreciate the care that he put into this exercise!

When Matt joined he first listened a ton and asked hundreds of questions every week to better understand us, our team, and the situations they're in.
Since, we've had several great conversations about growth and how to be effective and Matt has become my number one source of advice in the company, and I can 100% trust him with things I hand off to him.


We talk so frequently and stay in sync, I wouldn't know what else he could do to support me better.

What are additional ways they could better support you?


I am missing a clear mission statement for the Search Platform team. A lot of the upcoming work is only tangentially related to search. I am not questioning how important the work is for the company. However, I feel it is important for any team to have a clear sense of identity and purpose. As part of forming a clear vision for the Search Platform team, I want Matt to feel comfortable to push back on some of the requests coming from outside the team.

I find Matt's communication very clear and timely. He has communicated what work is being prioritized at a company level, with ample notice for our team. I appreciate how Matt pushed for certain bottom-up priorities, like removing features from their 'limbo' state and bringing things to GA when possible. At the same time, he's encouraged our team to put forward our own priorities and projects, and clearly communicate these to the rest of the company.


I haven't heard a ton of feedback on goals/ expectations for me personally, but I assumed that's because I'm on top of things :)


How has your manager supported you and your development? What are additional ways they could better support you?
Matt has done a great job supporting me and the rest of product platform in our work. Specific examples:
He is always available to talk through tricky organizational or 'people' issues, and gives helpful, actionable advice like "you should call him up for a 1-1 to clarify X", or "now that we've worked on this for Y period of time, an RFC would be helpful"
From my perspective, part of a manager is providing "emotional support" and encouragement, and Matt does this often. He proactively recognizes things I've done that have been hard or that went well, which is motivating.
Matt has helped the search platform team with our planning and execution processes. I feel we've been more thoughtful in terms of what we prioritize and work on from week-to-week, and more focused on our priorities. His suggestions nicely balanced structure with the desire for low-overhead processes.


In terms of my personal development, Matt set up a nice process to get to know me as an engineer and person, and craft personal development goals together. I found this process useful in reflecting and reminding me of my personal priorities.


Going forward, I would love Matt's support on these personal development goals. One thing in particular he can help keep an eye on is helping align my work with my specific passions and strengths (and this applies more broadly to the team too!) For example, one of my goals is to learn and contribute more broadly to our platform, so I'd love his support in working on projects like multi-tenancy, or anything related to code intelligence.


Matt Manela Self
Engineering Manager


Over the past quarter, how did you perform against your level and role expectations?
I met expectations


Explain your above response.
Over the last quarter I have made tangible impact across the organization and my teams, as well as individually driving customer impactful technical work.


Organization
Helped drive, coordinate and land Linear as our new project management tool and help build guidance for how to use it effectively.
Drove expansion and continuation of the Technical Deep Dive series (and got feedback from multiple engineers who have used these to help understand an area before engaging in it!)
Participated on several interviews to help fill open positions (both manager, PM and dev)
Drove high level conversation on multi-tenant and openctx to help fund and prioritize the work.
Engaged with TS on multiple customer calls to help support and prioritize work.
Mathworks
Criteo
Stripe
Among others.


Team
Organized team wide planning processes for Source and Search Platform teams to build out a full prioritized backlog. This has served the team well to communicate what we are doing and what we can do next. And helps make clear when new top-down priorities happen, what work are we explicitly deferring.
Started an active coaching process with most people on the team. This helps establish trust, make sure the engineers feel understood and help us establish shared goals for growth.
Moved all three teams to 2 week cycles and a focus on incremental delivery
Partnered graph team with code search team on the svelte UI work to ensure we built the API with the new UI in mind and ensure the new UI was our key ship vehicle for the new API (and then syntactic as well!) and to help drive incremental progress.
Drove routine communication on team status (via bi-weekly update and then via Linear projects)
Actively worked with Search Platform team and Julie to help scope and drive right set of Search Context Quality work. Landed key improvements that both help cody context and search in general
Prioritized Perforce work for Source team after working with Aimee. Labels work landed and IP work is nearing completion. These are big feature to help us re-engage with past deals and expand current ones for big perforce using customers.
Engaged actively with Anton to help direct him past previous performance issues and re-commit to team and engagement. Good progress so far and will still actively work with him to ensure it continues.


Key code changes I made
While not my main goal, I try to find high leverage technical items to drive that are both customer impactful and help expand my knowledge of our system.
Landed Magik Langauge Support
Customer request from GE preventing expansion
Added syntax highlighting
Added symbol support
Added lang filtering
Landed Hack Langauge support
Customer request from Salesforce/slack preventing expansion
Added syntax highlighting
Added symbol support
Upgrade scip-dotnet and added auto-inference for it
Customer request from Critero
Added searching by perforce change list id
Customer request from Mathworks
Part of the changes that helped show them our commitment and lead to expansion
Built OpenCtx Provider for Azure Devops
Not a customer request, but just to help engage and provide feedback on our openctx initiative


What do you intend to focus on in the next quarter? What support do you need?
Focus for next quarter
Managed Multi-tenant Sourcegraph Initiative
Ensure plan is understand and bring clarity and direction to progress
Help team prioritize this work with incoming customer needs
Focus team on demonstrating incremental progress
Explain and de-risk as we learn more
Ensure shared understanding of work plan and progress across the company
Syntactic Indexing, SCIP Oriented API and Precise roadmap
We will land syntactic for Java and expand to other language this next quarter.
Ensure we communicate and monitor and demonstrate the value add
Build proper communications to ensure alignment on impact
Build Graph team roadmap for ordering the work after initial release to balance expansion with precise indexing technical improvement work (given the clarity we have on the criticality of precise for big enterprise deals)
Coaching and Growth
I plan to continue working closely with individuals and ensure they are being pushed and grown
This is an evergreen goal but since I am starting this process with most, I want to make sure I spend a good amount of time establishing this as a key service I offer them and demonstrate how I am committed to their learning and growing.




Support I need
Direct feedback on what I am doing well and where I should engage and focus more
Support on cross-team alignment and commitment on the MT effort.
Continued help on key prioritization decisions when we may need to say NO to a customer request.

Q3 check-in
Erika Rice Scherpelz Manager
Head of Engineering


How is this teammate performing against their level and role expectations?
You had a superstar quarter. Great work!


In 2-3 bullets, describe 1) what this teammate did well last quarter and 2) what this teammate can focus on next quarter
What went well:
See below for detailed list
Graph team played a critical role in landing Stripe deal and IMC expansion
Finished planned Perforce enterprise readiness work (critical for customers like MathWorks)
Played a critical role in scoping, planning, and coordinating execution on Multi-tenant, which is a critical commitment for FY26
Balancing the team's work between Multi-tenant and all of the other work they have going on
Has clearly established himself as a core and key leader in EPD
Why superstar quarter? Large, complex scope (table stakes at M4) combined with realized business impact from customer deals that Matt directly helped make successful. Although I don't want to take away from the Graph team's critical role implementing that work, Matt played a key role in making sure we delivered the right work at the right time (especially for Stripe).


Focus for next quarter:
Single most important thing from an business impact perspective: Deliver initial public version Multi-tenant for Jan 29th (and set things up for the next milestones in Q1)
... while keeping the team productive on escalations and other commitments (but with the right amount of pushback against new requests) — in terms of specifics, I'm aligned with what Matt put in his own notes
Continue growing team. Some areas that come to mind:
Search Platform: Context vs Multi-tenant: how do we grow and evolve the team?
Graph and Source: How do we keep support work under control?
Petri and Geoffrey: Both want to grow, do they have the opportunities?


Overall accomplishments:
Individual
Product Platform team management (total 10 reports; 9 SWE, 1 MLE)
Includes taking on management of Jan when we inlined MLEs into the product teams
Growth and mentorship of team members: leadership, career conversations, etc
Multi-tenant: kickoff, scoping, cross-team coordination, integrating team members from across Product Platform and Services
Organized Stripe requirements and helped clarify which were must have vs nice-to-have
Coordination between Graph and Code Search for code nav in new Svelte UI
Conversations on various Graph integrations with Criteo, Indeed, Block
Interviews both as peer interviewer and hiring manager
Improving engineering escalations with Support Eng
Continuing to add technical deep dives
Code: some Graph improvements and initial support for Azure DevOps Server
Team
Stripe! Stripe Ruby fixes and performance improvements.
Java Precise fixes for IMC trading
Perforce enterprise readiness work: p4 labels, p4 ip restrictions
Search Jobs got to DONE done
Various other improvements around context, performance, bug fixes
And, of course, always escalation work

As stated in my last review, I greatly value Matt's goal-setting approach, particularly the comprehensive exercise examining my work history, career aspirations, and developing actionable paths forward. I'm already seeing tangible growth from this guidance, exemplified by my recent presentation to Nvidia for the Perforce project.
I also appreciate Matt's approach to delivering constructive feedback. He demonstrates a strong ability to balance challenging me while remaining supportive - particularly in recent discussions about risk tolerance and project initialization. His method of first understanding my underlying motivations, then thoughtfully suggesting adjustments to my approach, creates an environment conducive to professional growth while maintaining psychological safety!

Matt and I have a running career development doc, where he asks me challenging questions, where we commit to goals, and on that he keeps me accountable.


Besides that, Matt is a great partner in crime. He always backs me up when I need to hand something off to focus elsewhere, I can just dump something on him and forget about it and trust he'll sort it out, and he brings in a lot of great management techniques. Some high-impact things that come to mind are the clear phase definitions for MTSG, running an exercise with the team to build up a well-defined and prioritized team roadmap, and spicing up our team retros that revealed a lot of things that we didn't get with the standard format I ran for a while.

Matt has consistently offered to support my professional development, and I appreciate his willingness to help me grow. I tend to prefer self-directed development, so I've often declined coaching, but knowing the support is available is valuable.


I work best in lean environments with minimal overhead, so if we could reduce the frequency of HR check-ins, that would be ideal. Perhaps automating feedback for engineers could be an option. An AI-based approach could summarize our recent commits, map them to our core competencies, and send a draft to review, saving time while maintaining quality feedback.

Matt has communicated clear goals around our key projects like multitenancy. He has also given helpful guidance on team planning and organization.




How has your manager supported you and your development? What are additional ways they could better support you?
Matt has helped align the projects I lead with my professional goals. For example, one of my explicit goals is to increase my technical breadth across product platform, and working on multitenancy has been a great way to do that.


He has also helped navigate difficult scoping and workload questions, like when search platform was asked to lead Cody Chat quality in addition to multitenancy and code search support.


Finally, I really appreciate Matt's availability to talk and his openness with me. I can bring concerns to him (even fuzzy ones like "I am not feeling great about X") and feel reassured and heard. This helps me move forward and focus on delivering my best technical work.

Being a recent joinee of one of Matt's teams, he has put great effort in setting expectations for the "new but old" role, especially when it relates to my function within the team, things like on-call etc. Understanding these very well is extremely helpful for me.


For the future, I would encourage Matt to be as direct as possible with me and keep addressing things proactively!




How has your manager supported you and your development? What are additional ways they could better support you?
I will admit that Matt has only been my direct manager for 3 weeks, but he has made the transition super smooth, not to mention taking care that I connect and integrate with the team as well as possible. This in turn has made me feel very supported and I have high hopes that we will continue to see this in the future.


I encourage him to continue holding me and others accountable for their work. In general, I would love to see continued support in getting smaller things off my back to enable a greater degree of focus.



Matt Manela Self
Engineering Manager


Over the past quarter, how did you perform against your level and role expectations?
I met expectations


Explain your above response.
I was able to drive the teams to work better and get more done with direct business impact.


Multi-Tenant: I drove the organization, communication, and technical scoping (with Erik) for the MTSG project. I actively collaborated with engineers, product managers, and designers across teams to shape the work, mitigate risks, and sequence tasks incrementally and visibly. Given the complexity and potential pitfalls of this long-term project, I ensured clarity and made thoughtful trade-offs to keep the project on track.


Graph Team: I played a crucial role in organizing the work to align with the Code Search team. This separation allowed the team to land the SCIP API earlier, benefiting the new Svelte UI by eliminating complex and erroneous client-side logic from the old app.
Additionally, I worked closely with the Graph team and Stripe to prioritize key tasks, ensuring we addressed the most critical issues. I helped establish a system with Dan for Stripe and CS to assign relative priorities to incoming issues, ensuring we focused on the right tasks.


Source Team: I collaborated with Aimee from TS to identify top product gaps, with Perforce coming out on top. I helped the team prioritize and scope P4 label and IP restriction support. The label work contributed to an expansion for Mathworks, and the IP work paved the way to re-engage with Nvidia and AMD.


Search Platform Team: I worked with the team to balance support for the context API while diving deep into and driving key parts of multi-tenant. With the team now officially owning context, I collaborated with Julie to scope and shape the team to successfully handle both streams of work.


People: After six months here, I feel well-acquainted with the engineers and have started providing more direct feedback. I am committed to ensuring they continue to grow, feel challenged, and advance in their careers.


Technical: I keep looking for technical items to drive that help increase my breadth and impact customers. I drove some key fixes for customer reported bugs form the new SCIP API to ensure we can continue rolling it out further.




What do you intend to focus on in the next quarter? What support do you need?
MTSG: My top priority is driving significant progress as the various components come together. We aim to deliver a viable product by the end of the quarter.
Graph: Ensure the team completes the Syntactic rollout for all customers and identify the next focus areas that can be leveraged for other key business opportunities.
Search Platform: Continue refining the team's structure and drive ambitious changes in the Context space. Ensure the team operates cohesively, not as separate groups of engineers.
Source: Ensure the team makes substantial progress on the MTSG project without compromising customer support.
People: Continue providing direct feedback and encouraging growth.




I would love concrete feedback on areas to increase impact and help the engineers and my teams grow.

Annual review


Geoffrey Gilmore Direct report
Software Engineer


Past 12-months: How has your manager supported your success over the review period? Please share examples of 1) what worked well and 2) any constructive feedback for improvement
Matt struck a great balance between giving me autonomy and providing support where needed. A few examples:
The March team planning and personal goal setting sessions helped me focus on high-impact work (like Perforce IP) instead of getting sidetracked by smaller fires. The “6-month impact” lens was particularly useful.
During Perforce IP, he didn’t just review my designs – he nudged me to present directly to NVIDIA stakeholders after helping refine my slides. Great push to own external-facing work.
When I got pulled into multitenant’s UI work, he checked in regularly to see if I needed backend backup (I survived the SvelteKit maze, but the safety net helped).
Volunteering me to mentor our new Source hire (once they’re onboarded) – looking forward to paying forward the guidance I’ve received.


One Growth Opportunity:
Earlier pointers to existing patterns/systems during ambiguous projects would help me avoid reinventing wheels (but this comes with more experience). Example: A quick “Check how [IC5] approached scaling in X system” during Perforce IP’s performance phase could’ve saved some R&D time.




I would choose to work for this manager again.
Strongly Agree




Next 12-months: What support do you need from your manager to be successful in the next year?
Help identify 1-2 cross-team projects (like Perforce IP) where I can drive both technical execution and stakeholder communication.
Support for presenting work externally (confs/blog posts) or internally (Eng All-Hands) to build domain authority.

Past 12-months: How has your manager supported your success over the review period? Please share examples of 1) what worked well and 2) any constructive feedback for improvement
Matt is the perfect manager for Sourcegraph. He effectively helped organise multiple teams all working on Multi-Tenant and did a great job at interfacing with our C-suite to ensure we worked on the right stuff + they understood the tradeoffs made.


For me what makes a great manager is someone who can act like an oracle for whats going on. But he did more than that and proved his technical chops with the above project management.


The only slight negative is he has a tendency to be very process heavy, especially around sprints/planning/etc. This is obviously a great thing given how well planning went for multi-tenant. But a lot of the work that is done in search-platform doesn't really fit in your usual "sprint" style planning. This might be more of a reflection on me than him though :)




I would choose to work for this manager again.

Great partner in both running Source and the multi-tenant initiative.


Matt brings in structure, defines processes that are simple and effective, and keeps people accountable.
He's a super reliable partner to me and always enables me to focus on what matters, by taking over tons of distractions and running processes. I would not have been able to be as effective as I was in the past year if he wasn't around.


What worked well:
Brought in great and lightweight processes, for defining the Source roadmap, for lying out the multi-tenant work, and for running effective communications about the status during the run-up to the launch of Enterprise Starter.
Has been a constant source of reason and advice to me and his other reports - he's able to make people feel safe and appreciated.
He dove in nose deep into all his teams domains and quickly built up a lot of knowledge of these, which helps tremendously when he goes into meetings where he represents his teams. I have never heard a case where he has misstated something that caused friction later. If he's ever unsure, he'll consult his TLs to confirm before communicating false facts.
During the MT project, he consistently helped defend the staffing of it, which ultimately let us ship a quality solution within the desired timeline.


Constructive feedback:
Make sure to sufficiently challenge teammates - I know he has a great handle on the strengths and weaknesses of people and we've talked about those to help support teammates, and he's been giving me hard challenges, but overall I think he could be a bit stronger in setting growth goals and expecting results. Note that I don't know what exactly he's discussing with people, and that this is very very high-bar feedback. My personal heat meter is: If I haven't heard anyone say this guy is tough then we can challenge the team a tad more.
I think he's slowly coming up to being at-capacity for how many reports and team domains he can realistically oversee and provide the amount of support to everyone that he provides me with - this is by no means criticism on him but as we keep hiring for the three teams and just had an internal transfer as well, I worry about his wellbeing. Happy to share more thoughts on how we could consider structuring things.




I would choose to work for this manager again.
Strongly Agree




Next 12-months: What support do you need from your manager to be successful in the next year?
As we're looking towards the highest-potential FY ever ahead, with tons of large-scope and critical projects on the horizon, we need to make sure we get most ahead of planning as possible (not settle on goals after the quarter started), need to remain laser-focused on a company-wide cohesive strategy, and ensure we land a lot of stuff on reasonable timelines.


Help me in advocating for these things, let's together work out the strategy for the MT platform and platforms at Sourcegraph in general, and support me in slowly transitioning more into an architect kind of role where I can more consistently do what I've done during the MT effort; coordinate several projects to ensure we all run towards the same goal and that the individual pieces integrate well with each other.


Stefan Hengl Direct report

Past 12-months: How has your manager supported your success over the review period? Please share examples of 1) what worked well and 2) any constructive feedback for improvement
What Worked Well:
The weekly 1:1 meetings with Matt have been helpful for discussing current projects and setting near-term priorities. I am impressed with how technical he is. He often has good insights and a fresh perspective.
Minor: I really like his idea of the go/no-go list for the multi-tenant project. I think that really gave everyone something to hold on to and see progress.
Areas for Improvement:
At times, the management style has been somewhat high-touch, verging on micromanagement. However, he improved a bit lately, so I don't want to stress this point too much.
In my opinion, his interpretation of his role is closer to that of a project manager rather than a line manager. Overall, I don't believe he managed to build a cohesive team. Instead, we simply take on projects and execute them, which resulted in the team becoming fragmented over the year, with everyone working on completely separate topics, often unrelated to search. Julie is often left with running the day-to-day meetings, although, I believe, she clearly expressed her wish not to take on people management tasks.


I would choose to work for this manager again.
Neutral


Next 12-months: What support do you need from your manager to be successful in the next year?
I would appreciate the opportunity to explore growth opportunities beyond the search platform team.


With Keegan switching teams and our team’s increasing focus on AI-centric NLS, I believe this is a good time to look at other areas, broaden my perspective and skillset.


Specifically, I could see myself contributing to the review agent — I’m particularly excited about it as I can see myself using it a lot. I also want to see the multi-tenant project become a success, and I am committed to contributing wherever I can have the most impact. Additionally, I’m keen to upskill in Svelte with Felix’s guidance. I am considering migrating the Search Jobs page to Svelte as a starting point.

Matt has not been afraid to get his hands dirty and dive into the details. Matt, your excitement for and ability to engage on many different fronts -- be it technical deep dives, communication skills or project management -- is quite rare in a manager of your tenure.


Some examples: developing expertise on syntax highlighting, developing a better understanding of different parts of the code intel backend code (including investigating and fixing a tricky bug in 'Find usages' in deeply unfamiliar code), developing a better understand of the DB schema.


I posted this in the #thanks channel earlier, I think this is fairly accurate


Thank you Matt for the frequent and timely feedback about what I'm doing well and which areas need improvements. I appreciate that you don't shy away from given concrete suggestions and challenges along different axes (cross-team collaboration, incremental delivery, etc.).
It often takes a while for me to be convinced of ideas which are contrary to my existing working style, but I appreciate your patience both when I'm not convinced, and well as when repeating certain key messages over time.

I understand that Matt wants to encourage other people outside the team to contribute to our product areas, but let's also balance that with sustainable development for our team. For example, Matt taking over Quinn's large PR for Svelte highlighting potentially sets a bad precedent. Let's make sure we can avoid this from happening again.


We also need to make sure that some other engineer owns scip-dotnet, so that Matt is not on the critical path when a customer issue strikes.

Make sure you're working at a sustainable pace: availability and even throughput is more important than peak throughput. I'm concerned about the number of direct reports you have: on-top of that there are many different projects. You try to give your best every day and in your interactions with everyone (this is evident in how many different engineers have posted in #thanks about you), but everyone has limits, yourself included.

Matt has brought a lot of structure to the Source team, both for the team as a whole as well as individuals. He leads regular meaningful retrospectives, and we iterate on team processes to figure out what works best.


He has been great at managing projects as well, setting up views to make sure we're tracking meaningful progress, and bringing to our attention when we could improve on reporting progress. The "Go/No-go" list he posted every week in the multi-tenant slack channel is a great example of this. It takes a massive cognitive load off of us to know that, should we forget something, there's a very high likelihood of him picking it up.


He's also been adamant about personal development, and figuring out where I can personally grow.


What worked well


Setting up team processes and automating as much as possible has been fantastic.


I also appreciate keeping a pulse on personal development.


Constructive feedback


Honestly have nothing to add. He has exceeded my expectations.

Matt has been a great partner in leading the Search Platform team:
He improved our planning process, helping us move to a sprint-based set-up, with a biweekly check-in to ensure our priorities and current work is aligned. Our team priorities are also clearer (as they're now organized into quarterly projects), making it easier to communicate what we're working on.
He has encouraged us to propose "bottom up" projects, for example improving the architecture of symbols indexing. He is a proponent of "bring awesome things to the finish line that we already have". This has given us more energy and motivation to prioritize certain work that could have taken a backseat to top-down initiatives.


In terms of my personal growth, Matt has been a source of encouragement and helpful advice. He notices and comments on areas where I've done well, which I find gives a motivation boost and much-appreciated feeling of appreciation. He's also given great advice on interpersonal questions like "how would you approach a tough conversation with person X?"


One area I think we could use more help from Matt is in navigating product direction/ top-level engineering priorities, and how it relates to our goals as a team. Our team often gets sucked into not-well-defined, sometimes even not-well-motivated product directions like NLS/ intent detection for Omnibox, or Guardrails. I try to raise clear concerns and push back on these (as much as I deem is appropriate for a TL in each circumstance, and as an engineer it's often best to convince through code and prototypes :)) I don't hear Matt saying "no" a lot in these circumstances, or taking a proactive stance like "hey, we already have a team vision of X this quarter, we need a different end-to-end owner for this" I end up dealing with a ton of these conversations myself, like trying to figure out what to build that will actually be valuable, saying "no" to taking on way too much scope, and preventing the team from doing work that is too risky or not high impact.


One "confounding factor" here is that we don't have a PM, and haven't really had one my entire time at Sourcegraph. So we are all really just trying our best in terms of team vision and priorities.




I would choose to work for this manager again.
Agree




Next 12-months: What support do you need from your manager to be successful in the next year?
I would love support from Matt in ensuring the team is working on the right high-level things to have a significant impact and reach our potential. This is common challenge in platform teams, and we also don't have a product manager! I feel like some of our projects have clearly been successful, but sometimes we've gotten pulled into things that are ill-defined or not-clearly-well-motivated, and that has cost us time and potential for impact elsewhere.




Additional Feedback (Optional): Any other feedback to help your manager improve?
Matt I really enjoy having you as a manager, thanks for all the great guidance and insights over the last year.

Matt has been great at supporting me, e.g.


indicating areas where I could show more initiative,
encouraging and helping with regular public updates on the state of our projects
keeping focused on the scope of the project and helping manage distractions
tracking and highlighting high value items
helping with cross-functional communication
being optimistic


If I were to make one suggestion for Matt, is to shift some of the focus from the future big items, to the things that slow us down right now, and pursue their resolution with more vigour.

What worked well
I've only been Matt's report since mid October. I cannot overstate how well Matt led the effort to integrate me into the team in a short period of time. I was initially quite concerned as my work wasn't well integrated with the rest of the team - my worry was that I'd be a separate entity with separate ownership etc. However, Matt made it clear that we're doing this properly, as a full integration so I would have the support to do great work.


With me and Srijan joining the team, the team's scope expanded to ML as well. I am highly impressed at Matt's great effort to understand the many gotchas of this area despite him being new to it: metrics, being highly data/eval-driven...


Matt seems to always make sure that I have everything that I need and that I'm not blocked on anything for any reason whatsoever. I was quite happy to see a good amount of focus on my professional development from his side.


Lastly, I have to commend Matt for always looking at the big picture, which is easily forgotten when you're in the trenches solving problems. He makes sure I hold myself accountable and that I don't set aside important, but non-urgent things.




Areas for improvement
Matt has a quite high number of direct reports. As a result, he can be a bit scattered around as he has many situations requiring his attention. I admit I have very little to offer in terms of advice here as it is a difficult situation.


It happens often that our team syncs get derailed a bit, perhaps due to a lack of structure. I feel like it would be nice if he kept a stronger handle on how we spend the limited time there and made sure that we cover all important pieces before jumping into long debates.




I would choose to work for this manager again.
Agree




Next 12-months: What support do you need from your manager to be successful in the next year?
We are a team where the work we do isn't necessarily immediately or highly visible. Despite this, it cannot be argued that we solve very hard and impactful problems. This puts us in a position where we have to take great care to demonstrate what we do in ways that resonate with people. It's even more complex when we have to account that different people perceive the functionality we build quite differently (we've seen this with omnibox), so accounting for different perspectives is also highly desirable.


I would be very glad to get more oversight and help in the direction of this visibility. I feel like Matt's perspective here can be extremely valuable as he is great at keeping the big picture in mind. Great visibility means great impact demonstration, which I see as extremely helpful for the whole company. The initiative with blog posts is a great starter here and I hope to see more of that.


Apart from that, in general I would highly appreciate the occasional political capital loan - mostly to push back and say no if necessary. Eval-driven work and especially ML has much, much more inertia than "regular" dev work, meaning getting things of the ground is time-consuming and cumbersome. But once the wheel is rolling, the impact can be amazing. In a nutshell, I'm asking for support to prevent us getting off course if at all possible.

It’s still early days for me, but Matt has been really supportive and considerate so far.


What worked well
Matt ensured that my onboarding was smooth and that I had enough time and opportunities to learn about the stack.
He answered my questions about the projects and priorities and gave me the flexibility to work at my own pace.
He made sure everyone was on the same page during weekly team meetings.


Constructive feedback for improvement
Matt suggested that I post regular updates in the working group, no matter how big or small. This has helped me keep the team informed and build a strong working rapport.
Whenever I asked him a question about the product or a specific technology, he encouraged me to post it in Slack groups. This has accelerated my learning and helped me engage more with the broader team.




I would choose to work for this manager again.
Agree




Next 12-months: What support do you need from your manager to be successful in the next year?
These are the key areas where I believe support from Matt would help me succeed in the next year:
More knowledge-sharing sessions within teams and sub-teams to ensure important insights are leveraged to improve the product. For example, using graph information to enhance code search quality.
Tracking projects with relevant metrics that align with overall business goals. Having local metrics for each project and connecting them to broader business metrics would help measure progress and ensure alignment with leadership. For instance, defining metrics for code search quality and linking them to a business metric, if feasible.
Clear short-term and long-term expectations. If the goal is to build a world-class ML stack for code search but I spend a quarter or two on backend changes, it could indicate a misalignment. Setting the right expectations upfront would help in better planning.
Advocating for more documentation within the team and across related teams to improve knowledge transfer and long-term maintainability.




Additional Feedback (Optional): Any other feedback to help your manager improve?
For new team members like me, having more opportunities to learn about other product features and sister teams would be beneficial. For instance, I have limited visibility into what the Cody-Core team is working on, and based on my conversations, the same seems true in the other direction. However, I believe both teams have a lot to share and can learn from each other, which could ultimately accelerate execution.


Some common challenges - such as setting up the evaluation framework, data annotation, ML training, deployment pipelines, and latency improvements - could be shared across teams. Matt could play a key role in bridging this gap and fostering better collaboration. I am cognizant of the fact that the frequency of such catchup-ups may be pretty low given the priorities.

Matt is probably the best engineering manager I got to work in the last few years.
On the MT initiative was really well organised and able to keep structure moral and support going given the size of the team and the different engineering disciplines involved.


Not only that, it was always reassuring to know Matt knew a lot of the details, inner workings and limitations of our architecture and system design which proves helpful many times when issues go technical.


I can't say much about direct manager capabilities, as I do not report directly to Matt, but in our interactions Matt was always helpful to me, understanding my requirements and also providing feedback, negotiating and managing product direction.




Next 12-months: How can this teammate support you, your team, and the company over the next 12 months?
Ensure that UX features and fixes remain highly prioritized and properly staffed. As a company, we have a tendency to shift focus away from UX soon after product launches, which can lead to gaps in the overall user experience. To address this, we need Engineering Managers to act as consistent advocates and gatekeepers of the user experience, alongside the design team.


I believe Matt is already attuned to the importance of this and has shown strong awareness in this area. This feedback is less about identifying a gap and more about reinforcing the need for sustained focus and encouraging a shift in mindset.

Matt joined the team early in the year and hit the ground running. Since then he's been guiding the Platform teams to success in many areas, including the extra-large Multi Tenant project, which he has overseen to successful launch.
Not content to just manage, Matt is frequently seen in RFCs and in our codebases: commenting on PRs and contributing to projects as varied as treesitter and the VSCode Cody extension.
Through it all, Matt remains a source of inspiration to his fellow EMs and a mentor to his DRs.
His clarity of insight and commitment to excellence were vital to the success of the Multi Tenant project.
The care that Matt brings to everything he does and the synergy he creates with other teams are inspirations for me.




Next 12-months: How can this teammate support you, your team, and the company over the next 12 months?
Matt, you joining the team is one of the highlights of my year. Your clarity of insight, dogged determination, and commitment to excellence are an inspiration to me.

Past 12-months: Looking back over the past review period, how would you rate your performance against the expectations of your role, level and our values? Please provide specific examples in the comment field that justifies your performance rating. Where did you excel? Where do you need improvement?
2 - superior


I exceeded expectations for my level over the past 12 months (10 months really since I joined in April). I started as the manager of 3 deeply technical teams responsible for critical areas of the product. I quickly got up to speed after joining and helped the team deliver significant value. I encouraged incremental delivery and fostered a culture that prioritizes customer value through sustainable engineering.


On a personal note, the past 10 months stretched me as a manager. I had to learn to make an impact on multiple deeply technical teams, many of which had expertise I did not possess. I leveraged my experience and technical background to shape team decisions while I gradually got up to speed technically. I cultivated a culture of trust and customer-focused decision-making.


As a manager here, I need to drive:
· Individual growth - enabling engineers to excel and improve
· Team success - helping teams work better and achieve more together
· Product impact - delivering key initiatives and driving customer impact
· Organizational impact - finding ways to improve all teams




Here are some highlights in these areas:


Individual Growth
· Challenged and pushed technical leads (Julie, Erik, and Varun) to delegate more and consider bigger picture impacts.
· Engaged with all engineers in career planning, setting goals with most on how to enhance their skills.
· Provided direct feedback regularly, encouraging engineers to think about the "why" of their work and ensure meaningful contributions.


Team Success
· Transitioned teams to a sprint process, leading to higher quality results and fewer long-term projects.
· Instituted team retrospectives to ensure feedback was heard and enabled each team to optimize itself.
· Communicated team goals and progress clearly, aiding teams in creating clear backlogs through effort/impact processes, making trade-offs easier to describe to leadership and driving high-impact work.


Product Impact
· Refocused and aligned the Graph team efforts with the Code Search team, ensuring a joint commitment on the new code graph API, leading to cleaner code and enabling the syntactic feature.
· Engaged deeply with the Stripe trial, helping structure priorities for the Graph team, resulting in landing the deal.
· The Source team delivered several top-priority customer requests, including critical features for Mathworks and Nvidia, explaining the "why" behind the work to the team.
· The Search Platform team drove the context API work, improving Cody context and enhancing key search features.


Organizational Impact
· Managed and delivered the multi-tenant initiative, a cross-team project involving various disciplines. Developed the project plan, facilitated high-quality decision-making, and ensured local MT mode integration for faster iteration. This project required extensive technical and product expertise to deliver a well-scoped solution, showcasing my strength in handling large, complex, and interconnected projects.
· Helped implement the organization change from GitHub to Linear, engaging multiple parties and pushing for commitment, resulting in increased clarity across product teams.
· Drove the technical deep dive series, turning tribal knowledge into accessible information for new and existing employees, receiving positive feedback.




In addition, I am committed to engaging directly in the code and making opportunistic changes. This keeps me grounded and ensures I understand key components at a low level.


Over the past year, I drove individual items with direct customer impact. A few highlights:


Key Individual Technical Contributions
· Hack/Pkl/Magik language support - helped unblock Slack from using SG.
· Wrote OpenCtx provider for AzureDevOps to learn about the initiative and expand its scope.
· Updated SCIP-Dotnet, leveraging my .NET knowledge, and met with customers on adoption.
· Fixed Perforce navigation issues for a more native experience, benefiting Mathworks and other customers.




Growth Areas
· Provide more direct and honest feedback, building trust with engineers to ensure it is well-received.
· Balance focus effectively between different teams and projects, ensuring all receive support even when one project demands significant time.




Next 12-months: What goals or skills will you focus on in the next year? What kind of support do you need from your Manager to be successful?
Focus Areas for this next year
Provide more direct feedback to promote development and growth.
As the team increases in size and responsibilities, find the right balance and delegate more tasks to team leaders and members.
Participate more in cross-group discussions and seek opportunities to better connect the work of Product Platform with other ongoing initiatives.


How to support me?
I am concerned about maintaining a strong connection with each person and team as the scope of Product Platform grows. I would appreciate coaching and guidance in this area.

Revise this so that the bulleted list is inlined in the paragraphs with no more than one sentence per project area. Assume that this will be alongside the accomplishments list, so this can focus just on the key points that really illustrate the performance. Also, remove the "areas for growth"; we'll address those separately. Finally remove any and all redundancy and minimize descriptive text that isn't concrete. Go for a painfully clear and concise style.

Matt struck a great balance between giving me autonomy and providing support where needed. A few examples:

The March team planning and personal goal setting sessions helped me focus on high-impact work (like Perforce IP) instead of getting sidetracked by smaller fires. The “6-month impact” lens was particularly useful.
During Perforce IP, he didn’t just review my designs – he nudged me to present directly to NVIDIA stakeholders after helping refine my slides. Great push to own external-facing work.
When I got pulled into multitenant’s UI work, he checked in regularly to see if I needed backend backup (I survived the SvelteKit maze, but the safety net helped).
Volunteering me to mentor our new Source hire (once they’re onboarded) – looking forward to paying forward the guidance I’ve received.

One Growth Opportunity:
Earlier pointers to existing patterns/systems during ambiguous projects would help me avoid reinventing wheels (but this comes with more experience). Example: A quick “Check how [IC5] approached scaling in X system” during Perforce IP’s performance phase could’ve saved some R&D time.

Matt is the perfect manager for Sourcegraph. He effectively helped organise multiple teams all working on Multi-Tenant and did a great job at interfacing with our C-suite to ensure we worked on the right stuff + they understood the tradeoffs made.


For me what makes a great manager is someone who can act like an oracle for whats going on. But he did more than that and proved his technical chops with the above project management.


The only slight negative is he has a tendency to be very process heavy, especially around sprints/planning/etc. This is obviously a great thing given how well planning went for multi-tenant. But a lot of the work that is done in search-platform doesn't really fit in your usual "sprint" style planning. This might be more of a reflection on me than him though :)

Great partner in both running Source and the multi-tenant initiative.


Matt brings in structure, defines processes that are simple and effective, and keeps people accountable.
He's a super reliable partner to me and always enables me to focus on what matters, by taking over tons of distractions and running processes. I would not have been able to be as effective as I was in the past year if he wasn't around.


What worked well:

Brought in great and lightweight processes, for defining the Source roadmap, for lying out the multi-tenant work, and for running effective communications about the status during the run-up to the launch of Enterprise Starter.
Has been a constant source of reason and advice to me and his other reports - he's able to make people feel safe and appreciated.
He dove in nose deep into all his teams domains and quickly built up a lot of knowledge of these, which helps tremendously when he goes into meetings where he represents his teams. I have never heard a case where he has misstated something that caused friction later. If he's ever unsure, he'll consult his TLs to confirm before communicating false facts.
During the MT project, he consistently helped defend the staffing of it, which ultimately let us ship a quality solution within the desired timeline.

Constructive feedback:

Make sure to sufficiently challenge teammates - I know he has a great handle on the strengths and weaknesses of people and we've talked about those to help support teammates, and he's been giving me hard challenges, but overall I think he could be a bit stronger in setting growth goals and expecting results. Note that I don't know what exactly he's discussing with people, and that this is very very high-bar feedback. My personal heat meter is: If I haven't heard anyone say this guy is tough then we can challenge the team a tad more.
I think he's slowly coming up to being at-capacity for how many reports and team domains he can realistically oversee and provide the amount of support to everyone that he provides me with - this is by no means criticism on him but as we keep hiring for the three teams and just had an internal transfer as well, I worry about his wellbeing. Happy to share more thoughts on how we could consider structuring things.

What Worked Well:
The weekly 1:1 meetings with Matt have been helpful for discussing current projects and setting near-term priorities. I am impressed with how technical he is. He often has good insights and a fresh perspective.
Minor: I really like his idea of the go/no-go list for the multi-tenant project. I think that really gave everyone something to hold on to and see progress.
Areas for Improvement:
At times, the management style has been somewhat high-touch, verging on micromanagement. However, he improved a bit lately, so I don't want to stress this point too much.
In my opinion, his interpretation of his role is closer to that of a project manager rather than a line manager. Overall, I don't believe he managed to build a cohesive team. Instead, we simply take on projects and execute them, which resulted in the team becoming fragmented over the year, with everyone working on completely separate topics, often unrelated to search. Julie is often left with running the day-to-day meetings, although, I believe, she clearly expressed her wish not to take on people management tasks.

Matt has not been afraid to get his hands dirty and dive into the details. Matt, your excitement for and ability to engage on many different fronts -- be it technical deep dives, communication skills or project management -- is quite rare in a manager of your tenure.

Some examples: developing expertise on syntax highlighting, developing a better understanding of different parts of the code intel backend code (including investigating and fixing a tricky bug in 'Find usages' in deeply unfamiliar code), developing a better understand of the DB schema.


I posted this in the #thanks channel earlier, I think this is fairly accurate


Thank you Matt for the frequent and timely feedback about what I'm doing well and which areas need improvements. I appreciate that you don't shy away from given concrete suggestions and challenges along different axes (cross-team collaboration, incremental delivery, etc.).

It often takes a while for me to be convinced of ideas which are contrary to my existing working style, but I appreciate your patience both when I'm not convinced, and well as when repeating certain key messages over time.


Constructive feedback:


I understand that Matt wants to encourage other people outside the team to contribute to our product areas, but let's also balance that with sustainable development for our team. For example, Matt taking over Quinn's large PR for Svelte highlighting potentially sets a bad precedent. Let's make sure we can avoid this from happening again.


We also need to make sure that some other engineer owns scip-dotnet, so that Matt is not on the critical path when a customer issue strikes.

Matt has brought a lot of structure to the Source team, both for the team as a whole as well as individuals. He leads regular meaningful retrospectives, and we iterate on team processes to figure out what works best.


He has been great at managing projects as well, setting up views to make sure we're tracking meaningful progress, and bringing to our attention when we could improve on reporting progress. The "Go/No-go" list he posted every week in the multi-tenant slack channel is a great example of this. It takes a massive cognitive load off of us to know that, should we forget something, there's a very high likelihood of him picking it up.


He's also been adamant about personal development, and figuring out where I can personally grow.


What worked well


Setting up team processes and automating as much as possible has been fantastic.


I also appreciate keeping a pulse on personal development.


Constructive feedback


Honestly have nothing to add. He has exceeded my expectations.

Matt has been a great partner in leading the Search Platform team:

He improved our planning process, helping us move to a sprint-based set-up, with a biweekly check-in to ensure our priorities and current work is aligned. Our team priorities are also clearer (as they're now organized into quarterly projects), making it easier to communicate what we're working on.
He has encouraged us to propose "bottom up" projects, for example improving the architecture of symbols indexing. He is a proponent of "bring awesome things to the finish line that we already have". This has given us more energy and motivation to prioritize certain work that could have taken a backseat to top-down initiatives.

In terms of my personal growth, Matt has been a source of encouragement and helpful advice. He notices and comments on areas where I've done well, which I find gives a motivation boost and much-appreciated feeling of appreciation. He's also given great advice on interpersonal questions like "how would you approach a tough conversation with person X?"


One area I think we could use more help from Matt is in navigating product direction/ top-level engineering priorities, and how it relates to our goals as a team. Our team often gets sucked into not-well-defined, sometimes even not-well-motivated product directions like NLS/ intent detection for Omnibox, or Guardrails. I try to raise clear concerns and push back on these (as much as I deem is appropriate for a TL in each circumstance, and as an engineer it's often best to convince through code and prototypes :)) I don't hear Matt saying "no" a lot in these circumstances, or taking a proactive stance like "hey, we already have a team vision of X this quarter, we need a different end-to-end owner for this" I end up dealing with a ton of these conversations myself, like trying to figure out what to build that will actually be valuable, saying "no" to taking on way too much scope, and preventing the team from doing work that is too risky or not high impact.


One "confounding factor" here is that we don't have a PM, and haven't really had one my entire time at Sourcegraph. So we are all really just trying our best in terms of team vision and priorities.


Matt has been great at supporting me, e.g.


indicating areas where I could show more initiative,
encouraging and helping with regular public updates on the state of our projects
keeping focused on the scope of the project and helping manage distractions
tracking and highlighting high value items
helping with cross-functional communication
being optimistic

If I were to make one suggestion for Matt, is to shift some of the focus from the future big items, to the things that slow us down right now, and pursue their resolution with more vigour.

What worked well
I've only been Matt's report since mid October. I cannot overstate how well Matt led the effort to integrate me into the team in a short period of time. I was initially quite concerned as my work wasn't well integrated with the rest of the team - my worry was that I'd be a separate entity with separate ownership etc. However, Matt made it clear that we're doing this properly, as a full integration so I would have the support to do great work.


With me and Srijan joining the team, the team's scope expanded to ML as well. I am highly impressed at Matt's great effort to understand the many gotchas of this area despite him being new to it: metrics, being highly data/eval-driven...


Matt seems to always make sure that I have everything that I need and that I'm not blocked on anything for any reason whatsoever. I was quite happy to see a good amount of focus on my professional development from his side.


Lastly, I have to commend Matt for always looking at the big picture, which is easily forgotten when you're in the trenches solving problems. He makes sure I hold myself accountable and that I don't set aside important, but non-urgent things.



Areas for improvement
Matt has a quite high number of direct reports. As a result, he can be a bit scattered around as he has many situations requiring his attention. I admit I have very little to offer in terms of advice here as it is a difficult situation.


It happens often that our team syncs get derailed a bit, perhaps due to a lack of structure. I feel like it would be nice if he kept a stronger handle on how we spend the limited time there and made sure that we cover all important pieces before jumping into long debates.

It’s still early days for me, but Matt has been really supportive and considerate so far.


What worked well
Matt ensured that my onboarding was smooth and that I had enough time and opportunities to learn about the stack.
He answered my questions about the projects and priorities and gave me the flexibility to work at my own pace.
He made sure everyone was on the same page during weekly team meetings.

Constructive feedback for improvement
Matt suggested that I post regular updates in the working group, no matter how big or small. This has helped me keep the team informed and build a strong working rapport.
Whenever I asked him a question about the product or a specific technology, he encouraged me to post it in Slack groups. This has accelerated my learning and helped me engage more with the broader team.

Matt is probably the best engineering manager I got to work in the last few years.
On the MT initiative was really well organised and able to keep structure moral and support going given the size of the team and the different engineering disciplines involved.


Not only that, it was always reassuring to know Matt knew a lot of the details, inner workings and limitations of our architecture and system design which proves helpful many times when issues go technical.


I can't say much about direct manager capabilities, as I do not report directly to Matt, but in our interactions Matt was always helpful to me, understanding my requirements and also providing feedback, negotiating and managing product direction.

Matt joined the team early in the year and hit the ground running. Since then he's been guiding the Platform teams to success in many areas, including the extra-large Multi Tenant project, which he has overseen to successful launch.
Not content to just manage, Matt is frequently seen in RFCs and in our codebases: commenting on PRs and contributing to projects as varied as treesitter and the VSCode Cody extension.
Through it all, Matt remains a source of inspiration to his fellow EMs and a mentor to his DRs.
His clarity of insight and commitment to excellence were vital to the success of the Multi Tenant project.
The care that Matt brings to everything he does and the synergy he creates with other teams are inspirations for me.

### **Prompts for Evaluating an Engineering Manager’s Performance**  

Use the following structured prompts to guide a performance review process for an engineering manager based on self, peer, and manager feedback. These can be adapted to fit different roles and contexts.  

---

### **1. Gathering & Summarizing Accomplishments**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Extract a concise list of accomplishments from the provided information. Focus on impact and results rather than activities. Group related items where relevant, and remove unnecessary descriptors. Keep it as clear and complete as possible while remaining almost painfully concise."*  

---

### **2. Structuring Accomplishments by Category**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Reorganize the extracted accomplishments to group them by key project and team areas. Then, create two lists: one for individual accomplishments and one for team accomplishments."*  

---

### **3. Writing a Concise Performance Summary**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Based on the extracted accomplishments and overall feedback, draft a concise performance summary answering the question: ‘Looking back over the past review period, how would you rate this teammate’s performance against the expectations of their role, level, and our values?’ The summary should be clear, concrete, and balanced—acknowledging strengths and areas for growth without excessive detail. Evaluate the candidate against the expectations for their level."*  

---

### **4. Assessing Possible Ratings**  
**Prompt:**  
*"For each possible rating (Distinguished, Superior, Meets, Partially Meets, Unsuccessful), make an argument for and against rating this teammate at that level. Then, provide a recommendation for the most appropriate rating with justification."*  

---

### **5. Refining the Summary with Missing Elements**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Building off the summary, integrate elements from the performance assessment that are missing. Ensure that all major strengths and areas for growth are captured. Keep the summary concise and clear, but include any relevant details that were previously omitted."*  

---

### **6. Extracting Key Quotes from Feedback**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Extract key quotes from the feedback that capture both positive contributions and areas for growth. The positive quotes should highlight major strengths, and the constructive ones should indicate areas for improvement. Do not summarize—quote the original text directly."*  

---

### **7. Defining Key Areas for Growth**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Based on self, peer, and manager feedback, outline 2-4 key areas for improvement and growth over the next 12 months. Structure the response as a bulleted list with one key area per category, using this format:  
* [Category / High-level growth area]  
  * [A single specific focus or action within this area]"*  

---

### **8. Meta Reflection on the Process**  
**Prompt:**  
*"Extract from the conversation the set of prompts I should use to go through this process with another person and similar data, especially for an engineering manager."*
