"The Tempest" is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1610–1611. The story is set on a remote island, where the sorcerer Prospero, rightful Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place using illusion and skillful manipulation. He conjures up a storm, the eponymous tempest, to lure his usurping brother Antonio and the complicit King Alonso of Naples to the island. Prospero commands the spirit Ariel to create the tempest and wreck the ship carrying these men.

On the island, their fates unfold. Alonso's son Ferdinand is separated from the rest and meets Miranda, with whom he falls in love. Another plot of rebellion brews among the shipwrecked crew, and Caliban, a native of the island and Prospero's unwilling servant, plots to rid himself of his master's control.

Through a series of staged events, Prospero leads the shipwrecked men around the island, eventually revealing his identity to them. Prospero confronts his brother and the King, forgives them, and regains his dukedom. He also arranges for the marriage of Miranda to Ferdinand. In the end, Prospero frees Ariel, decides to relinquish his magical powers, and returns to Milan for his daughter’s wedding, leaving the island to Caliban.
