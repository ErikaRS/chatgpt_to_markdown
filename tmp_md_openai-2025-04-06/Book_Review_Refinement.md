Let's temper this one a bit to better reflect my thoughtful, even handed review style. But don't pull punches on why I didn't like the book.

This book said a little with a lot of words. It had some good advice about how to think and communicate effectively in organizational settings, especially software organizations. If this book had been called something like "Thinking and Communicating Effectively in Software Organizations" then it could have earned another star. (And another star if it weren't so unnecessarily repetitive.)

However, I expected a book about systems thinking, and this book was not that. Systems thinking provides you tools for thinking about the dynamic of systems themselves, not how to operate within a system. Here's one concrete example: the author talked about feedback loops. Feedback loops are a core idea of systems thinking since they are a key mechanism for how systems exhibit non-linear system. What was the discussion of feedback loops about? It was about ways to effectively give and receive feedback. While giving and receiving feedback is a particular type of feedback loop, to conflate feedback loops in the systems thinking sense with giving feedback is really unacceptable.

So, this book escapes getting 1 star because it did have some good content, but because of its misleading uses of systems thinking concepts, it is really not worth reading if you're looking for a book that's actually on systems thinking.

Here’s a revised version of your review, maintaining your thoughtful and even-handed style while clearly outlining the book's strengths and shortcomings:  

---

This book aims to offer advice on how to think and communicate effectively in organizational settings, particularly in software organizations, and in that regard, it does provide some value. It presents practical tips for navigating workplace dynamics, fostering clearer communication, and improving interpersonal interactions. Had it been framed as a guide to "Thinking and Communicating Effectively in Software Organizations," it might have delivered on its promises more directly—and could have earned a higher rating. However, the content was often repetitive, which diluted its impact and made key ideas feel stretched unnecessarily thin.

The real disappointment lies in the book's misrepresentation of systems thinking. Systems thinking, at its core, provides tools to analyze the dynamics of systems themselves, focusing on interconnections, feedback loops, and emergent behavior. Unfortunately, this book uses systems thinking terminology but applies it to entirely different concepts, leaving readers misled. For example, the discussion of feedback loops—central to systems thinking as a mechanism of non-linear dynamics—was reduced to advice on giving and receiving workplace feedback. While feedback in communication is a valid topic, conflating it with the systems thinking framework is an overreach and muddles the meaning of the term.

While the book avoids being entirely dismissed due to its occasional useful insights, its misleading approach to systems thinking makes it a poor choice for readers seeking a true exploration of that subject. If you're looking for a practical guide to professional communication in software organizations, this book might have some value. However, if systems thinking is your goal, this is not the resource for you.

Make the language a bit less passive. E.g., "While the book avoids being  entirely dismissed" is very passive. Make the whole thing more active.

Here’s a more active and direct version of your review:

This book delivers some practical advice on how to think and communicate effectively in organizational settings, especially within software organizations. It offers useful tips for navigating workplace dynamics, improving communication, and fostering better interpersonal interactions. If it had been positioned as a guide to "Thinking and Communicating Effectively in Software Organizations," it would have been more honest about its scope—and likely more impactful. That said, the repetition of ideas drags down the content and makes it feel padded rather than focused.

The real issue is the book's misuse of systems thinking concepts. Systems thinking equips readers with tools to analyze how systems function, focusing on interconnections, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors. Instead of exploring these ideas, the book hijacks systems thinking terminology and applies it to unrelated topics. For example, feedback loops—a cornerstone of systems thinking because they explain non-linear dynamics—are redefined here as tips for giving and receiving workplace feedback. While communication feedback is important, conflating it with systems thinking is misleading and undermines the book’s credibility.

This book does have moments of value, particularly for those seeking advice on professional communication in software organizations. However, its misrepresentation of systems thinking concepts makes it a poor choice for anyone looking to understand how systems actually work. If you’re after real insights into systems thinking, you’ll need to look elsewhere.

This version is more direct and assertive, ensuring your critique has a stronger and more active tone.
