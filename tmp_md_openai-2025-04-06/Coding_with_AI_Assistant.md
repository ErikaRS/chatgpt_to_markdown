Write a version of "part of your world" about developers using an AI coding assistant named Cody. It should start 

I want to be where the cool devs are
I wanna see, wanna see them typing

### Assistant - 2023-09-12 08:38:07

(Verse 1)
I want to be where the cool devs are,
I wanna see, wanna see them typing,
Flipping those - what do you call 'em? Oh - keys!

Typing away, you don't get too far,
Commands are required for coding, scripting,
Sitting in that - what's that word again? Chair!

(Chorus)
Up where they code, up where they run,
Up where they stay all day in the sun,
Coding away, wish I could be,
Part of that world.

(Verse 2)
What would I give if I could live out of these plain docs?
What would I pay to spend a day with the devs on docks?
Bet'cha in Git, they understand,
That they don't reprimand their coders,
Bright young devs, sick of bugs,
Ready to stand.

(Chorus)
And ready to know what Cody knows,
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers,
What's a bug and why does it - what's the word? Crash!

When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love,
Love to explore the code up above?
With Cody's aid, someday I'd be,
Part of that world.

(Outro)
Oh, with every line and every command,
With every debug and every plan,
I'll make my way, with Cody's hand,
Part of that world.
