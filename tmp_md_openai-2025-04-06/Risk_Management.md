Given this paragraph, what's an alternate term for "solved risk" :

If we understand the problem and how to fully mitigate it, we might call it a solved risk. For example, we know how to perform medical procedures without spreading infections. Highrises near fault lines require stringent engineering codes and enforcement. Solved risks are still not easy — engineering is a discipline that requires good planning and expertise  — but at least we know the theory.

An alternate term for "solved risk" could be "managed risk".

What are 3 other suggestions?

Certainly, here are three additional alternatives to "solved risk":

1. "Mitigated risk"
2. "Controlled risk"
3. "Addressed risk"

What's a term that allows us to contrast it with controlled risks, where we don't have a full solution? E.g., engineering buildings is something we know the answer to. Stopping car accidents is something we can improve the baseline list and not eliminate.

A term that might capture this distinction is "Resolved Risk" for situations where we have a full solution (like engineering buildings), contrasting with "Controlled Risk" for situations where we can only mitigate but not fully eliminate the risk (like stopping car accidents). 

So, in the context of your request, a "Resolved Risk" is a risk where we have clear and comprehensive solutions. This contrasts with a "Controlled Risk," where we can only implement measures to limit the impact or probability, but the risk cannot be fully eliminated.
