What are alternate terms for complicated and complex (in the cynefin sense) that appeal to a broader audience

### Assistant - 2023-04-24 06:14:18

In the Cynefin framework, "complicated" and "complex" refer to different types of problems or systems. To convey these concepts in simpler terms that appeal to a broader audience, you can use the following alternate terms:

1. For "Complicated":
   - Intricate
   - Multi-faceted
   - Involved
   - Challenging
   - Sophisticated

2. For "Complex":
   - Dynamic
   - Unpredictable
   - Interconnected
   - Nuanced
   - Adaptive

Remember that the main difference between the two in the Cynefin framework is that "complicated" systems have a predictable cause-and-effect relationship, while "complex" systems have many interacting components and their behavior is often emergent and less predictable. When using these alternate terms, ensure that they convey the same distinction to your audience.
