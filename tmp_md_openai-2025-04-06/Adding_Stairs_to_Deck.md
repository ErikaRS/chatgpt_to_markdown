I have a deck that is 1.5 storeys above the ground. What is the best way to add outdoor stairs? Getting rid of the deck is an option

Adding outdoor stairs to a 1.5-storey-high deck is a substantial project that requires careful planning and adherence to local building codes. Here's a basic guide on how to add the stairs:

1. **Check Local Building Codes**: Before starting any construction project, consult with your local building department. They'll inform you about required permits, the necessary width and depth of the steps, the maximum riser height, handrail specifications, and other important details.

2. **Design and Planning**: Decide on the location and design of the stairs. Do you want them straight, L-shaped, or with a landing in the middle? Your design choice may depend on the available space, terrain, and your aesthetic preferences.

3. **Measurements**: 
   - Determine the total rise, which is the height from the ground to the deck surface.
   - Decide on the riser height (typically between 6-8 inches). Divide the total rise by the chosen riser height to get the number of steps you'll need. You may need to adjust the riser height slightly to fit the stairs evenly.
   - Decide on the run (depth) of each step. A typical run might be about 10-12 inches.

4. **Materials**: Choose materials that complement your deck and can withstand outdoor conditions. Pressure-treated lumber, cedar, and redwood are popular choices.

5. **Construction**:
   - Start by installing the stair stringers. These are the diagonal pieces that will support the stairs. They should be spaced 16-24 inches apart, depending on the width of your stairs and the material you're using for treads.
   - Attach the stair treads to the stringers.
   - For a 1.5-storey height, consider a landing or platform in the middle to break up the long flight and make it safer.
   - Install railings and handrails. This is not only a safety measure but often required by local codes.

6. **Safety**: Make sure the stairs are stable. For a high deck, strong support at the base and possibly mid-way (if you've incorporated a landing) is crucial. Consider using concrete footings for stability.

7. **Finish**: Apply a sealant or stain to protect the wood from weathering.

8. **Maintenance**: Regularly inspect your stairs for any signs of wear or damage, and repair any issues promptly. This ensures the stairs remain safe and prolongs their lifespan.

If you're considering getting rid of the deck, weigh the pros and cons. A deck can add valuable outdoor living space and possibly increase property value, but it also requires maintenance. If the deck is in poor condition, it might be more cost-effective to replace it rather than repair it and add stairs. Consider your long-term plans for the property, your budget, and your needs when making this decision. If you're not comfortable with construction, it's advisable to hire a professional contractor to ensure the safety and durability of the stairs.

How much ground space would stairs this tall use?

The ground space (or footprint) taken up by the stairs largely depends on the rise and run of each step, as well as the overall height (rise) of the staircase. Here's how to calculate it:

1. **Determine the Rise & Run**:
   - **Rise**: The total vertical distance from the ground to the deck. For a 1.5-storey deck, this might be approximately between 12 to 18 feet, depending on the height of each storey.
   - **Run**: The horizontal distance of each step. A common run is between 10-12 inches, though this can vary based on design and comfort preferences.

2. **Calculate Total Run**:
   - Total Run = Number of Steps × Run of Each Step
   - To find the number of steps, you would first decide on the height of each riser (typically between 6-8 inches). For instance, if the total rise is 15 feet (or 180 inches) and you decide on 7-inch risers, you'd have roughly 25.7 steps, which you'd round to 26 steps.
   - Using a 10-inch run as an example, Total Run = 26 steps × 10 inches/step = 260 inches, or 21.7 feet.

3. **Consider Landings**:
   - If you decide to incorporate a landing halfway up to break up the flight, this will take up additional ground space. A typical landing might be 3x3 feet or 4x4 feet, but this can vary.

So, if you're building a straight flight of stairs from a 1.5-storey deck without a landing and with a run of 10 inches per step, the staircase would project approximately 21.7 feet from the deck. 

Keep in mind that stairs with turns or curves, or those that zigzag (switchback designs) could have a shorter projection but might be wider or use space differently.

What about design? What are stylish but secure stair designs for this height?

### Assistant - 2023-09-24 08:22:08

Stylish and secure stair designs combine aesthetics with safety. For a 1.5-storey height, here are several design ideas that can be both stylish and secure:

1. **Straight Stairs**:
   - The simplest design. To add style, consider decorative railings, unique balusters, or luxury tread materials.

2. **L-Shaped (Quarter Turn) Stairs**:
   - This design breaks up the long straight run with a 90-degree turn, either at a landing or by using winders. The turn can be situated at the beginning, middle, or end.

3. **U-Shaped (Half Turn) Stairs**:
   - Features a 180-degree turn, usually with a landing in the middle. It's essentially like having two L-shaped staircases back-to-back.

4. **Split Stairs with Central Landing**:
   - Start with a short flight of stairs leading to a sizable landing. From the landing, two shorter flights lead up to the deck on either side, creating a symmetrical split design.

5. **Spiral Stairs**:
   - A compact and often visually striking choice, though they may be less comfortable for frequent use. Ensure the spiral's diameter is wide enough to be safe and comfortable.

6. **Floating Stairs**:
   - Treads appear to "float" without visible support from the side. This contemporary design requires strong anchors (often embedded in a wall) and may feature glass or cable railings for an open feel. Ensure they are built sturdily for safety.

7. **Flared Stairs**:
   - The bottom steps are wider and flare out, creating a grand entrance feel. This can be combined with other designs, like straight or L-shaped stairs.

**Materials & Details**:
   - **Wood**: Always a classic choice. Consider rich-toned woods or even a combination of painted risers with stained treads.
   - **Metal**: Can give a sleek, modern look, especially when combined with glass or cable railings.
   - **Stone or Concrete**: Offers a more rugged, natural look. Can be used for treads, especially with a metal or wood railing.
   - **Lighting**: Add LED strip lights under the treads or light fixtures on the side for a stylish and safe evening ascent.
   - **Planters**: Integrate planters on the sides or landings for greenery and a softer look.

Always prioritize safety by ensuring railings are sturdy and at the required height, and by using non-slip surfaces, especially in areas prone to rain or snow. Consider working with an architect or designer to achieve a balance between style and function. They can provide insights into designs that will best fit the space and your home's aesthetic.
