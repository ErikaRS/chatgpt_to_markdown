Original point:
6 months ago we decided to get an office space in SF to test whether having a physical space would help our brand awareness in the AI community and create better alignment and collaboration. 
In both of those cases, the SF office has been great! We’ve hosted community events with 100+ attendees, met with customers, and have had a bunch of team members (who don’t live in SF) visit.

My commentary: 
I feel like we could combine these into one point to focus less on the timeline and more on the success.

**Adjusting focus**

The user is thinking through rephrasing the original point by merging the two paragraphs, centering on the SF office's success in boosting brand awareness and collaboration, minimizing the timeline aspect.

Boosting awareness and collaboration

Our SF office has greatly enhanced our brand awareness in the AI community and improved team alignment and collaboration. We've hosted community events with over 100 attendees, met with customers, and welcomed team members from outside SF to visit.

Apply my commentary to the original, but also make it concise and punchy but also with an implicit awareness that this change has been somewhat controversial.
