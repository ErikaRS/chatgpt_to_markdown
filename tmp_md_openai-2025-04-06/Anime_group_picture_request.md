I don't have access to image generation, but if you switch to GPT-4o, you can generate an anime-style group picture of kids. Would you like me to help describe a detailed prompt to use there?

{
  "prompt": "Anime style group picture of a diverse bunch of cheerful kids, standing together in a park on a sunny day. The kids are of various ages (around 6 to 12), wearing colorful casual clothes, with expressive, happy faces. Some are making peace signs, others have their arms around each other. A few are holding toys like a soccer ball, a stuffed animal, or a book. Background includes green trees, blue sky with fluffy clouds, and a playground structure. The art style is bright, colorful, and typical of slice-of-life anime.",
  "size": "1024x1024"
