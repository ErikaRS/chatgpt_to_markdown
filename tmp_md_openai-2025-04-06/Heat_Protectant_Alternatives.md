In a pinch, using a rinse-out hair conditioner would generally be better as a heat protectant than a light body lotion. Hair conditioners contain ingredients specifically formulated to coat and protect hair strands, which can offer some level of heat protection. Body lotions, on the other hand, are designed for skin and may contain ingredients that could be heavy, sticky, or damaging to hair when exposed to heat.

However, keep in mind that neither option is ideal, and they won't provide the same level of protection as a dedicated heat protectant. If you choose to use a conditioner, apply a very small amount evenly and avoid overloading your hair to prevent greasiness.
