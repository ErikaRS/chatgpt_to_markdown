Make this more concise: 
Lattice question: Is there a way to get a shareable link for 1:1 notes? 

One piece of feedback I've gotten about lattice vs Google docs (beyond docs being able to search historically) is that one thing that makes dropping agenda items in docs throughout the week easier is that you can add a meeting notes link right to the calendar entry. As far as I can tell, there's not an easy way to get that in lattice since if I share my link to a 1:1 with the other person, it doesn't work for them.

How can I create a shareable link for 1:1 notes in Lattice? Google Docs allows adding notes to calendar entries, but it seems Lattice doesn't support this easily.

Keep this mostly as is but make it a bit more concise:
Hey folks! I wanted to follow up on the exercise (... from October) of aligning on Eng Role Expectations for H2. @stevey, @Lauren Ross, and I went through all of the IC5 and IC4 engineers together and went through the IC3, IC2, and IC1 engineers async. We spent the most time on IC5s and IC4s because that's where we tend to have the most discussion and misalignment. 

Please go through and look at the comments we left on anyone you manage, and let us know if you have any question.

Also, this list of goals is inevitably out of date. Don't bother updating it. Instead, please take the spirit of the comments and make sure you're setting expectations clearly and in a level aligned way in the mandatory manager check-ins in lattice.

Hi team! Quick update on our October exercise for aligning Eng Role Expectations for H2. @stevey, @Lauren Ross, and I reviewed all IC5 and IC4 engineers and assessed IC3, IC2, and IC1 engineers asynchronously. We focused more on IC5s and IC4s due to frequent discussions and misalignments.

Please review the comments on your team members and reach out with any questions.

Remember, the goal list is outdated, so no need to update it. Instead, use the comments as guidance to set clear, level-appropriate expectations during the mandatory manager check-ins in Lattice.
