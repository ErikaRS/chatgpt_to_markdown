The CEO is going to be rolling out some direction changes right away. The changes are direct responses to things the team has been asking for clarity on, but the change emphasizes that the departure is because of underlying disagreement.

As the head of engineering, here are some concerns you should anticipate:

1. **Team Morale**: The departure of a respected leader, even if amicable, can cause uncertainty and anxiety within the team. Address concerns and reassure the team about the future direction and stability of the company.

2. **Communication**: Ensure clear and transparent communication about the reasons for the departure and the upcoming changes. Miscommunication or lack of information can lead to rumors and further anxiety.

3. **Alignment and Buy-In**: The product leader had supporters, so there may be resistance to the new direction. Work to build consensus and get buy-in from the team, especially those who respected the departing leader.

4. **Transition and Knowledge Transfer**: Ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities and knowledge. Identify key areas where the product leader's input was critical and plan for continuity.

5. **Team Dynamics**: Changes in leadership can impact team dynamics. Monitor for any emerging conflicts or issues and address them promptly.

6. **Clarity on New Direction**: Make sure the team understands the new direction and their roles in it. Provide clear goals, expectations, and support to help them adapt.

7. **Engineering-Product Relationship**: The departing leader was less respected by the engineering team, so this may impact the relationship between engineering and product teams. Work to foster collaboration and ensure the teams are aligned.

8. **Feedback and Concerns**: Be open to feedback and concerns from your team. Create an environment where they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and address any issues that arise promptly.

By proactively addressing these concerns, you can help ensure a smoother transition and maintain team morale and productivity.
