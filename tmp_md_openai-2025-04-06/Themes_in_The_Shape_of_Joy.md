## Highlights
- But the deeper point I wanted to make to the graduates wasn’t that we struggle to make good choices. My deeper point was that even if the compass of our life were perfectly pointed toward happiness, few of us make it safely to that far shore of joy. Life gets interrupted. You took a detour, and it became the destination. Life had other plans for you. Even if your dreams point toward happiness, dreams can be broken or unfulfilled. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=85))
- Life teaches you pretty quickly that dreams are fragile things. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=89))
- “And so, graduates, I’m not concerned about your best day. The good days will take care of themselves. What interests me now is your worst day. Which brings me to the question I came here to ask you: Class of 2019, how are you going to face the worst day of your life? What will get you through your lowest point and darkest moment, when you experience heartbreak, failure, shame, and regret? Who will you be when you are holding the shattered pieces of a broken dream? How do you survive that day?” ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=97))
- What is going to happen when you arrive at your lowest point? How will you face the worst day of your life? If life is a final exam, this is the only question on the test. And everything depends on your answer. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=101))
- Joy isn’t ultimately found on your best day. Life is glorious when your dreams come true. The urgent, pressing question is how we face our worst days. The secret to happiness is found in the darkness. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=105))
- Average life expectancies have been declining in the United States because of a sharp uptick of deaths of despair, in some demographic groups by over 300 percent. And this is just one small piece of our much larger mental health crisis. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=111))
- And everyone, regardless of age, experiences chronic vulnerability to what some psychologists have called derailment, the precariousness of happiness given how our dreams and best-laid plans can be so easily knocked off course. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=113))
- As the philosopher Charles Taylor has described, the self was once curved outward. Psychological stability was achieved by making contact with a transcendent, spiritual reality that existed outside and beyond the anxious drama of our inner lives. But over the last few centuries, as Taylor recounts, our mental life has slowly become curved inward upon itself. The modern ego is self-absorbed. We’ve become trapped within ourselves. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=117))
- Are you curved inward upon yourself? Or are you curved outward, reaching out to connect with a transcendent, sacred reality that exists beyond yourself? On the morning of the worst day of your life, your joy will be determined by this, the shape of your soul. Geometry will determine your destiny. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=121))
- Transcendence is good for you. Happiness, joy, peace, meaning in life, psychological resiliency, and inner tranquilly are achieved when we pivot away from the self to find rest in a transcendent reality that exists beyond ourselves. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=126))
- There was only one characteristic that separated the shame resilient from the rest of us—the shape of joy. Brown discovered that the shame resilient possesses a single, fundamental conviction: feeling “worthy of love and belonging.” ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=134))
- This unhelpful contradiction at the heart of her research launched Brown on a quest, a journey where she rediscovered the wisdom of the great spiritual traditions—that our worthiness of both love and belonging comes to us as a gift. In the Christian tradition, this is called grace. Your value, your worthiness, is simply a truth that you embrace with gratitude. This will be your lifeline on the worst day of your life. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=140))
- Who are you on your worst day? The answer to that question isn’t found by looking inward. Help comes to us from the outside, in a grace that picks you up over and over again, no matter how hard or far you fall. On your very worst day, grace tells you that you are worthy of love and belonging. Grace stands you on your feet, dusts you off, and sends you back out into the game of life. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=152))
- The modern self has turned inward, becoming increasingly self-focused and self-absorbed—even self-obsessed—as we stew in our own anxious, ruminative juices. We are trapped in our heads. And curved inward upon ourselves, the modern mind putrefies like a stagnant pool cut off from a source of fresh water. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=159))
- Here we’ll discover that the first step toward joy is a step away from yourself. Like a blooming flower, the inwardly curved self must start to open up. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=165))
- Joy springs from the transformative power of moving beyond yourself. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=168))
- If the voice of grace is, in the end, simply your own voice, if grace is just another self-help technique, another mental mind hack, you haven’t really escaped yourself. You’d still be trapped in your own head. Still curved inward. Your mind still alone, poisoning itself. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=171))
- Grace, to be grace, is an encounter with a transcendent reality that exists independently of your own. Transcendence, going beyond yourself, isn’t a therapeutic trick that keeps you talking to yourself in disguise. Grace, as a transcendent experience, isn’t self-affirmation, a “You got this!” sticky note you put on the mirror. Grace exists, and you have to turn away from yourself to find it. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=175))
- Times of crisis can be revelations. Sometimes in the middle of the storm, we find that we can stand. We discover a strength we didn’t know we possessed. But crises can also expose weaknesses, the fractures in the foundation of our society, our relationships, and our mental stability. The wind blows, and life comes crashing down. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=190))
- Before COVID-19, we knew our shared vision of reality was splintering. It wasn’t just that we were politically polarized and had strong ideological disagreements. The problem went deeper. We knew we were living in echo chambers, but COVID-19 revealed that we had come to inhabit alternative realities. We discovered we existed in different worlds. Truth itself was up for grabs. Your facts were my fake news. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=201))
- We couldn’t talk to each other because we had no common reference point, no shared vision of reality. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=205))
- The bell of history was calling us to heroic action. But we couldn’t agree on anything. Reality had become a Rorschach inkblot. Facts were open to interpretation. We projected onto the world our paranoia and fear, and each of us saw a very different boogeyman. And far too often, we saw each other as the monster. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=206))
- And even if we didn’t suffer from acute mental illness, the lockdowns revealed a vacuum in our lives, an existential hole. Unable to go out to eat, attend a movie, or hit the clubs, we found the hollowness of our lives exposed. A life full of distractions and entertainments had kept us from taking a hard look in the mirror. The lockdowns left us alone with ourselves, and we found that experience sad and unsettling. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=213))
- The loss of our shared vision of reality and our mental health crisis are each rooted in a profound change that has affected the geometry of the self. COVID-19 revealed how the modern mind had collapsed upon itself, trapping and imprisoning us within ourselves. The consequences of this collapse were there for everyone to see: our mental health has been radically destabilized, and the very nature of reality is now up for grabs. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=221))
- This exercise in what has been called Cartesian doubt radically altered the shape of the self. In doubting the existence of the world, Descartes withdraws within himself. Reality becomes compressed to a single point, a psychic singularity, a psychological black hole. With the whole of reality radically rejected, Descartes is left only with himself, the lonely boat of his ego afloat on a dark sea of doubt. All that exists, with 100 percent certainty, is me. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=243))
- With Descartes, the geometry of our experience of the world was flipped inside out. Prior to Descartes, truth was established by making contact with a reality that existed outside my head and beyond myself. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=252))
- For Descartes, truth doesn’t start with reality, coming to know and agree with something that exists independently of myself. Truth collapses upon the isolated ego. Truth starts with me. I become the arbiter and judge of what is or is not real. The only thing you can be certain of is yourself. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=255))
- Doubt became the acid of the Enlightenment, used to dissolve the dusty certainties of the ancient world and launching us into a freethinking future of technological progress and social liberation. But radical doubt opened Pandora’s box. If you doubt the existence of everything, then everything can be doubted. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=261))
- No purported “fact” now stands a chance as the self can doubt anything it pleases. When the self collapsed, truth evaporated. Starting with Descartes, we’ve been set free to construct a world of our own choosing, sculpting the “facts” to support any vision of reality we find compelling. You’ll have your truth, and I’ll have mine. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=268))
- Beyond creating our post-truth world, the collapse of the self also undermined our mental health and emotional resiliency. When the ego turned away from reality to make itself the ultimate arbiter of truth, it also turned away from sacred narratives, symbols, values, and rituals that once provided us with meaning, significance, and purpose in life. Throughout human history, psychological stability was achieved by connecting with a sacred and spiritual reality that existed independently of our own neuroses. We found rest in this reality because it didn’t depend on us. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=271))
- The ego could stand amid the storms of life because it clung to a sacred stability infinitely more solid than itself. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=277))
- The Christian mystic Pseudo-Dionysius, who wrote in the sixth century, described this transcendent reality as “the cause of everything” and as the “sacred stability” that grounds and supports our lives. As Pseudo-Dionysius describes, we use a host of words to capture our encounter with transcendence: Being, Source, Creator, Love, Goodness, Center, Unity, Spirit, Savior, Grace, and Light. But ultimately, declares Pseudo-Dionysius, this reality is, in the final analysis, “the Nameless One,” transcending all human categorization, verbal description, and rational comprehension. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=280))
- However conceived or culturally described, our lives were once held, valued, and directed by this Beauty, Love, and Light. The geometry of our lives was directed outward toward our Source. Psychologically, this sacred grounding provided us with a firm, stable platform on which to stand. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=285))
- When life comes crashing down and we stand, ashamed and lost, in the rubble of failure and regret, we find shelter where the value and meaning of our lives are held safe, secure, and inviolate. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=290))
- Without this Refuge, the ego is left alone and naked, exposed to the icy blasts of rejection, loss, self-defeating behaviors, broken dreams, failure, and catastrophe. When we stand isolated and bereft of help, we take it all directly in the face. All the pain, despair, stress, fear, and trauma. We shiver in the cold, battered and bruised, with no hope of support or rescue. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=298))
## New highlights added February 8, 2025 at 8:19 PM
- The greatest tragedy of modern life is that we have willfully turned our back on this comfort. We’ve closed in on ourselves and looked away from the Sacred Source of our being. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=301))
- The ego needs a protected, safe place to rest and rehabilitate. A place where wounds are healed, fears soothed, and courage regained. Lacking this, the ego grows weary, and the damage of life, often self-inflicted, accumulates like scar tissue. Eventually, cracks appear. Chronic stress. Crippling shame. Debilitating depression. Free-floating anxiety. Growing addiction. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=303))
- Sigmund Freud is the air we breathe. We’re all Freudian. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=317))
    - Note: Note that this is not a compliment
- For Freud, emotional stability was achieved not by reaching upward and outward toward sources of transcendent comfort and support but by plumbing the murky depths of the unconscious psyche. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=319))
- It’s almost impossible to get a clear, honest view of yourself. The cracks aren’t exactly where we think they are. You never really know if you’re telling yourself the truth. Plus, progress can be elusive and fleeting. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=327))
- We are masters of self-deception. Living “my truth” is often just living a lie. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=331))
- Freud couldn’t deliver what he promised the modern world. As the old joke goes6, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=335))
- What happened to Descartes happened to Freud. Descartes turned inward, toward the self, hoping to secure the truth. Instead, the truth was destroyed. The self was liberated to doubt anything it wanted. Any fact can now be called “fake news.” In a similar way, Freud turned inward, promising to secure our mental health in the trusted pronouncements of the psychoanalyst. But when psychoanalysis was revealed to be hokum, we were abandoned by our guide to wander the corridors of the mind alone and unaided. Freud led us deep into the caves of the mind, promising he had a map and a flashlight to guide us back out. But once we got lost in the darkness, we discovered he had neither. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=337))
- The story I’ve shared here is selective and simplified. But there’s broad agreement among scholars that both Descartes and Freud, for the reasons we’ve just discussed, were critical players in the collapse of the self. The modern ego is a novelty, an innovation. New to history. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=343))
- According to Taylor, our prior, ancient self was experienced as “porous.” In the experience of the porous self, the boundary between the ego and the external world was permeable. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=345))
- In Latin, the modern self is incurvatus in se (curved inward), upon itself. The modern self isn’t just buffered; it is curved. What Descartes and Freud did was to fundamentally alter the geometry of the self. As we’ve seen, the ancient self was curved outward—we were once excurvatus ex se. This outwardly curved self was oriented away from itself toward external reality, especially transcendent truths and values. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=351))
- Are we curved inward or outward? Incurvatus in se or excurvatus ex se? The question is vital and pressing because an inwardly curved self—being incurvatus in se—has disrupted and destabilized the modern world. Both truth and joy have gone missing. And it’s all due to psychological geometry. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=355))
- The modern self is just like inflating a car tire with a bike pump. It is an exhausting project. Every day, we awake to the task of becoming the self we aspire to or the self we want others to like or admire. We try, in the language of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, to “self-actualize.” We “perform” the self, like an actor taking the stage before an audience. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=371))
- The frantic effort we put into performing the self is a modern affliction. After the self collapsed, it has demanded constant reinflation. Being a self has become effortful, energy-consuming work, birthing uniquely modern pathologies and dysfunctions. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=377))
- With this shift comes a new pathology. The affliction of guilt has given way to weariness—weariness with the vague and unending project of having to become one’s fullest self. We call this depression. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=384))
- Scarcity is what we experience when the self collapses. We feel depleted, empty, drained, and lacking, like a flat tire in the driveway. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=393))
- Whether true or not, that thought of not enough occurs to us automatically before we even think to question or examine it. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=398))
- This internal condition of scarcity, this mind-set of scarcity, lives at the very heart of our jealousies, our greed, our prejudice, and our arguments with life. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=402))
- We are caught in what I call a scarcity trap, where dealing with scarcities in one area of life creates scarcities elsewhere. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=407))
- Scarcity is a whack-a-mole problem. We can’t keep up. Filling in one hole just creates a hole elsewhere. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=410))
- Our never-enough problems are problems of our own making. We are working with a widespread assumption about how to achieve mental health and psychological resiliency that is deeply mistaken. This assumption shows up everywhere, a belief that guides our parenting, educational systems, and therapeutic enterprises. The idea is this: we think that happiness involves the enhancement of self-esteem. We are attempting joy through self-regard. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=415))
- The therapeutic imperative here is crystal clear: you need to feel better about yourself. And that’s the precise moment we step into the quicksand. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=421))
- Self-esteem is a trap. We’re smoking cigarettes mistaking them for medicine. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=424))
- But self-esteem is, at best, a temporary fix. Self-esteem works right up until the moment you bump into your next failure. This makes self-esteem a never-ending and exhausting project: we have to keep rehabilitating our self-assessments, over and over again. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=427))
- And James shares the formula. He writes that self-esteem “is determined by the ratio5 of our actualities to our supposed potentialities; a fraction of which our pretensions are the denominator and the numerator our success: thus, Self-esteem = Success / Pretensions.” ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=436))
- By “pretensions,” James means our goals, the life we desire and want. Self-esteem, then, is an emotional feeling that measures the degree to which the life we have—what we have been “successful” in securing for ourselves—matches the life we want. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=439))
- Stated bluntly, self-esteem is an emotional metric of dissatisfaction. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=447))
- You can see the disaster brewing. We are building our mental health on an emotional metric that keeps track of our failure. No wonder our mental health is in freefall. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=452))
- The problem is also that esteem is a measurement, an emotional feedback system. Since life is full of successes and failures, self-esteem goes up and down, reflecting those changes. As a feedback system, self-esteem is like the stock market. Sometimes the market goes up, and sometimes it crashes. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=454))
- In the storms of life, we need psychological stability, a firm place to stand. We want deep roots to hold us in place. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=460))
- According to Leary and Baumeister, self-esteem has less to do with successes and failures, as William James believed, and more to do with our social relationships. Self-esteem, in this view, is an internal emotional thermometer telling us how socially valued and loved we are. The temperature of this social thermometer—a sociometer—can be high (you feel welcomed, loved, and included) or low (you feel rejected, alone, and unloved). ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=466))
- As a bit of innate relational software, having a sociometer in your head makes perfect adaptive sense. Humans are profoundly social creatures, so we need something in our brains telling us how well our relationships are going. If we’re alienating people, we need some emotional feedback to help us adapt and change in social contexts. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=475))
- There’s a reason why we experience loneliness as painful. That pain nudges us to seek connection, like hunger nudges us toward food. The sociometer also rewards us with warm, fuzzy feelings when we experience intimacy and love. These positive vibes reward interpersonal behaviors that facilitate our connections with others. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=478))
- All this makes perfect sense. We need a sociometer. We’d be lost socially without it. But a sociometer is a disastrous thing to depend on for mental health, for the exact same reasons we observed with William James’s view of self-esteem. Once again, a sociometer is a meter, a measuring device, an emotional feedback loop. And being a meter, the sociometer is supposed to go up and down as we experience either rejection or love. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=480))
- As I’ve pointed out, we need something to lean on when we experience rejection, loss, and heartbreak. And it’s precisely in those moments when the sociometer is going to fail you. In fact, when you’re at your lowest moment, the sociometer will just show up to kick you in the teeth. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=486))
- What we need in moments of loss and grief is something that helps us escape this trap, something that turns us away from that negative inner voice and gets us out of our heads. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=492))
- The more difficult and deeper problem here is how our expectations are products of social comparison. We want to compare well with others, and everyone seems to be climbing. So we rush to keep up. And if we start slowing down while everyone keeps moving closer to their dreams, we worry that we are settling. We grow anxious because we’re being left behind as friends and family keep reaching that next milestone. Social media has made this sort of social comparison a daily emotional confrontation, a virtual mirror that reflects our failure and mediocracy. Our lives feel chronically diminished by the successes of others. We steep in envy and insecurity. And keeping up becomes an exhausting project. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=501))
- This pervasive status anxiety is what makes it so difficult to lower our expectations in the equation of self-esteem. When we fail to meet cultural standards of success, we fear the loss of respect, value, worth, and dignity. Shame keeps us pushing. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=509))
- With technological innovation came entrepreneurship, effort, and ingenuity. If you had grit, determination, and a strong work ethic, a person born into poverty could escape the slums and trailer parks. For the first time in history, a person could climb the social ladder. And they did. The old aristocratic class system was slowly dismantled. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=518))
- But the advent of the American dream—everyone can make it—came with a price. For better or worse, we’ve become responsible for our success in life. The peasant or slave of bygone eras had to settle for their lot in life. They had no other choice. But in our world, to settle is to be a slacker. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=521))
- Status anxiety is why we find modern life so exhausting. The rat race isn’t just about putting food on the table. We’re competing for dignity. Your value as a human being is now something you can lose. It’s just one failure away. This makes it impossible to step off the hamster wheel. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=529))
- When the voice in our head breaks the news that “you have just failed” or “you have just been rejected,” where are we to turn for support and comfort? ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=537))
- Day in and day out, we spend enormous amounts of energy talking back to ourselves. Self-affirmation is wearying. Especially when we have actually failed and been rejected, when the ugly facts are staring us in the face. We need comfort in these moments, not another inner debate with ourselves. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=547))
- But sometimes, beyond the exhaustion of this daily effort, the mirror itself gets cracked. And when the mirror cracks, we might never be able to see ourselves in a healthy or positive way again. The obvious examples here are trauma and abuse. Things happen to us through no fault of our own that permanently damage our self-perceptions. To be clear, I’m not saying damage is destiny, that victims can’t live full and happy lives. Just that the bad things that happen to us can haunt us, often for our entire lives. Whenever we look at ourselves, there’s a crack in the mirror that never quite goes away. And no amount of therapy or medication seems to remove it. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=555))
- The tragic thing is that most of these cracks don’t come from trauma or abuse. The cracks originate from the sad but predictable hurts of everyday life. When you ask people about the origins of their negative self-image, where the crack in their mirror came from, they will tell you stories. Something happened or was said to them that became internalized, like a thorn in the mind, as “the truth” about themselves. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=560))
- At the heart of our insecurities, there’s always an origin story, something that cut or shamed us. Maybe it was a long and prolonged season of pain or abuse, or maybe it was quick and fast like the stab of a knife. But whatever it was, it cracked the mirror, and we’ve never had a clear view of ourselves since. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=564))
- you can’t talk people out of these cracks. I’ve tried to talk people out of these cracks, and so have you. But self-esteem can’t be talked into people. Words don’t repair the mirror, not fully or completely. Nor can a drug prescription, as helpful and lifesaving as those can be. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=568))
- The trap we’re all caught in is that we’ve become fixated on how we think and feel about ourselves. We’re stuck inside ourselves, our mental wheels spinning in the mud of failure and rejection. Our self-ruminations are imprisoning us. We obsessively keep looking at ourselves in the mirror, over and over again. But that is the very source of our problem, how our self-conceptions have become so self-referential, like a dog chasing its tail. We expect this thing that is broken—myself—to be a tool that will fix me. Our self-recriminations perpetually debate our self-affirmations like a deadlocked jury that can’t reach a verdict. This is the trap of self-esteem. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=573))
- Why are conspiracy theories so popular? Psychologists have observed that conspiracy theories2 satisfy three human needs. The first need is epistemic, making sense of the world. The world is scary and unpredictable. By giving us a grand narrative of life, especially explanations for disconcerting and troubling events, conspiracy theories make life feel more coherent. ... Beyond epistemic needs, conspiracy theories also meet social needs. Conspiracy theories create community. Facing the ridicule of society and family members, conspiracy theorists band together, circling the wagons to create an “us against the world” network of support. ... There is a third and final aspect of conspiracy theories I want us to focus on. Beyond satisfying epistemic and social needs, conspiracy theories satisfy existential needs, our hunger for meaning and significance in life. Like Edgar Welch, we all want to be a hero. Conspiracy theories typically see the world as a battle between good and evil. In this war, the conspiracy theorist enlists to join the army of light, working with others to save the world from cataclysmic destruction. Conspiracy theories are often crusades of righteousness. This narrative imbues life with sacred purpose and significance. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=603))
- Conspiracy theories are existential narcotics, intoxicating us with delusions of grandeur. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=618))
- Take the red pill, and you’re now a soldier on the frontlines of a war. This heroic vision of yourself is an emotional high that’s hard to find anywhere else. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=623))
- The existential intoxication we observe in conspiracy theories parallels pathologies we also find among religious groups. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=626))
- Generation after generation, these end-time beliefs among Christians have met the same psychological needs as conspiracy theories. Biblical prophecy helps make sense of a world that is scary and unpredictable. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=637))
- The existential drug here is the same one that intoxicated Edgar Welch and the Capitol Hill insurrectionists. In a shallow and meaningless age infused with status anxiety, here is the red pill that will imbue your life with heroic purpose. Conspiracy theories and evangelical apocalypticism push the same drug. Take the pill, and your boring, low-status life becomes infused with world-historical significance. A battle is raging, and you’ve been called to war. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=649))
- In his 1973 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, The Denial of Death, the anthropologist and psychologist Ernest Becker described the origin of the “the superhero complex.” Specifically, contemporary life faces an existential vacuum. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously ushered in the modern world with his declaration that “God is dead.” Without God, without some transcendent source of value and meaning, the modern self enters a world devoid of purpose. The atheist Richard Dawkins describes the world5 without God this way: “In a universe of blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won’t find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.” ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=667))
- This pitiless cosmos where life has “no purpose” creates a psychological crisis. Because we want our lives to matter. We want our small acts of kindness and compassion to carry some significance. We want our sacrifices to count in some larger, cosmic sense. Facing this predicament, says Becker, we search for a means of significance. We do this by creating and participating in a “hero system,” which I describe to my students as a hero game. We play this hero game, in the words of Becker, “to earn a feeling6 of primary value,” a sense of cosmic specialness. This hero game makes us matter and count. Winning our hero game is how we achieve self-esteem. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=674))
- Simply stated, everyone has a superhero complex. We all want to matter, so we each invent some game of significance that we can “win.” ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=680))
- There seems to be an asymmetry here between the magnitude of the hatred given the triviality of the subject matter. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=701))
- Author and essayist Freddie deBoer follows in the footsteps7 of Ernest Becker in describing these pathologies of fan culture. Specifically, deBoer points to how the collapse of meaning in the modern world created new challenges in becoming and establishing the value of the self. Into this void stepped capitalism, which began to provide us, through its various products and entertainments, with a way to buy or borrow an identity. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=702))
- We can borrow meaning by inhabiting the fictitious stories being sold to us, from Harry Potter to Star Wars. “Unfortunately,” says deBoer, “this can have the effect8 of fooling oneself into thinking that consuming these representations of meaning is the same thing as having meaning, of feeling one has a meaning-driven life.” Through imaginative identification, fan culture tricks us into thinking we’re living a heroic life. Lacking a story of my own, I can rent one from my favorite video game or movie. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=708))
- Video games and movies have become repositories of meaning, wrapped up into our hero games. Fans make death threats because the video game or movie is more than a bit of fun entertainment. Movies and games are bike pumps being used to reinflate the deflated ego, a means to imbue life with purpose, weight, and significance. ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=714))
- Star Wars isn’t in your control, so if you give yourself up to it and someone does something with it that you don’t like, your whole world gets rocked. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=721))
- And these properties, no matter how sophisticated they are, or how beloved they are, just can’t contain enough substance to anchor a sense of self. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=722))
- We didn’t have a word for it then, but since 2014, we’ve all become intimately familiar with the toxicity of callout and cancel culture. Online activism has become a hero game, a game we can win or lose. We call this game performative activism or virtue signaling. Generally played by the political left, the goal of the game is to always be on the right side of the oppressor/oppressed dichotomy. Playing this game successfully, always correctly calling out and canceling the oppressors, imbues life with moral purpose and significance. We’re soldiers in a war being fought one hashtag at a time. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=746))
- Political activism has its own issues with the superhero complex, a hero game where we escalate our solidarity with the oppressed by calling out those less committed to the cause. Radical movements eventually come to eat their own as they play this game of moral one-upmanship. Our heroic quest for a meaningful life causes us to burn the house down, even if friends and allies are inside. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=754))
- This is the inexorable logic of the superhero complex at work in social justice activism, pushing radical activists to cannibalize their own and political causes into escalating violence. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=763))
- ‘It’s a lot like purity politics in the church,’ Park observed, referring to the tendency of Twitter groups to attack perceived wrongdoers. It is, she pointed out, a strategy that works for activists until it turns on them. ‘You do one wrong thing,’ Park said, ‘and you’re tainted. You’re out forever.’” ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=767))
- Consider how political psychologists have been tracking the rise of affective polarization. Different from issue polarization, where we disagree about how best to solve the problems facing our countries, affective polarization has to do with the negative feelings we have about people who vote differently than we do. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=772))
- As we all have witnessed, our politics have become increasingly bitter and hate-filled. Our political debates are no longer principled disagreements between fellow citizens but bomb-throwing between sworn enemies. Politics has become a fight between good and evil, our modern, secular form of holy war. ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=775))
- Our strongest impulses to discriminate10 are no longer directed at racial or religious differences but at political opponents. Politics has become for us the ultimate hero game, the repository of our most deeply held values and beliefs. Nothing defines the modern self better than how we vote. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=779))
- Political disagreements are no longer pragmatic attempts to solve problems but are, rather, experienced as a rejection of my most cherished convictions, a denial of my very self. And the deeper the cut, the more violent the defensive response. Politics has become a blood sport because it means too much, not politically but psychologically. Every election, my identity is on the ballet. Are you for me or against me? ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=782))
- But as an author, you don’t pay attention to that. What stings in the midst of a hundred glowing reviews is a single negative review. Sadly, our brains are more attuned to negative feedback than to positive. We quickly forget twenty compliments to obsess over one criticism. This makes reading your book reviews a nightmare. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=798))
- Here is what I discovered when I published a book. I had stepped out of one hero game right into another. I’d won the professor hero game by finally getting published. A win! But I quickly discovered I’d started playing the author hero game, a game governed by bestseller lists, book reviews, and sales rankings. I thought I had won, only to realize I was losing all over again. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=808))
- But most of our hero games are personal and unique. Not a huge game involving thousands but the game I’ve chosen for my own life. These are the games we play in our workplaces or gyms. Among friends who share a hobby or common interest. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=813))
- As I tell my students, “Everybody is a snob about something.” We all have something we cherish, where we are considered the best, can show off, or stand in the spotlight as the expert in the room. We all have a game we’re playing. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=817))
- Our families of origin have hero games as well. Every family instills in you a vision of what a “winning” life looks like. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=819))
- The approval of our parents is the scorecard of this game, our successes and failures measured in Mom and Dad’s disappointment with how we’ve turned out. It’s the hero game tracked by the resentments of sibling rivalries and facing our inadequacies every holiday and family reunion. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=822))
- When you play these games of status, success, and significance, you measure winning and losing by what psychologists call upward and downward social comparison. Feelings of snobbery, superiority, and vanity—“winning” our hero game—flow out of downward social comparison as we look down on those beneath our level of attainment. Feelings of “losing” our hero game involve emotions of envy and jealousy, judgments of upward social comparison, the resentments and shame we feel witnessing the success of others. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=824))
- In a world sick with status anxiety, upward and downward social comparison infuses every social interaction with the potential for diminishment. How will I compare with you when we meet? Will your life successes fill me with a gnawing sense of jealousy? Or will I bask in the glow of smug superiority as I share with you my latest accomplishment? ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=828))
- But hero games are our addiction. Status is a drug. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=832))
- “Rest!” we exclaim. “I need that.” Life is so busy and stressful. We all need to slow down, to unplug and restore ourselves. We crave seasons of Sabbath. And yet few of us actually practice Sabbath. We never slow down. It’s a puzzle: Why do we avoid doing what we desire so much? Why won’t we rest? ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=835))
- “The reason we don’t rest,” I explained, “is because of shame. It takes shame resiliency to practice Sabbath.” It all goes back to our hero games. Remember, scarcity is a whack-a-mole problem. Our hero games get us caught up in scarcity traps, where investment in one area of life demands a divestment elsewhere. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=838))
- That is the hard truth. If you want to practice Sabbath, you will have to get used to losing at something. You’ll have to face the shame of falling behind in some game of success you’re currently playing to step into a different, healthier rhythm of life. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=848))
- I share this story simply to say that it’s not easy to step away from your hero game. Even when the game is killing you. Or killing your family. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=853))
- We cling to the source of our self-esteem, the fount of our value and worth, like a security blanket. Because without the game, we’re nothing. We’d rather burn out, destroy our health, and ruin our families than let go of what makes us worthy of someone’s time and attention.

- Emotional health is not just about learning how to rest, how to step away from the bike pump. Wholeness is stepping into peace. And by peace, I don’t just mean calm. I mean nonviolent; I mean stepping away from a competitive and comparative way of achieving meaning and significance in your life. This is a peace that can only come by letting go of our addiction to “win” or “be the best” at something, to hit some mark we’ve set for ourselves—the rest of stepping away from envy and jealousy when we’re at the bottom and vanity… ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=869))

- My mind was like flypaper. Every time I touched a thought, I got stuck in the glue. I struggled to extract myself by thinking more thoughts, but that only deepened my inner anxious spiral. I couldn’t shake free. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=907))
- As I experienced my first day Taizé, try to sit quietly, and you’ll come face to face with a boil of thoughts within yourself. Turing inward, you won’t experience peaceful, quiet bliss. What you’ll find are jumpy, scattered thoughts. ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=913))
- Our minds don’t sit still and quiet. We leap from thought to thought like a frog in a frying pan. And the story here is even worse than you think. This chronic mental wandering negatively affects our mental health. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=917))
- Ponder that. Almost half of our waking lives are spent lost within ourselves. Mentally, we’re just not present; we’re somewhere else. And here’s the most tragic finding of the study: mental wandering was associated with increased unhappiness. As the researchers concluded2, “a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.” ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=922))
- Our default mental state is that our minds wander, and getting lost within ourselves makes us unhappy. Emotional unrest is the consequence of being curved inward upon yourself. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=926))
- Most of our mental wandering takes the shape of self-talk, a voice in our heads. The ego is talkative and chatty, keeping up a running commentary throughout the day. Much of our unhappiness stems from paying more attention to this inner voice than to what is happing in the world around us. Our attention is bent inward. We miss out on life because we’re morbidly self-focused. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=929))
- On the outside, we’re smiling and nodding along, but on the inside, we’re listening to news reports of our social failure. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=937))
- Kross describes what science has discovered4 about this search: “In recent years, a robust body of new research has demonstrated that when we experience distress, engaging in introspection often does significantly more harm than good. It undermines our performance at work, interferes with our ability to make good decisions, and negatively influences our relationships. It can also promote violence and aggression, contribute to a range of mental disorders, and enhance our risk of becoming physically ill” (italics mine). ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=944))
- Turning inward doesn’t produce joy; it produces depression, anxiety, and hostility. You won’t find rest by “going inside” yourself. Cut off from the world, your mind will slowly poison itself. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=948))
- If joy has a shape, we have to flip the self inside out, from being curved inward to being curved outward. You need to reverse the curvature of your ego. And the first step in this process is turning away from your internal chatter. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=951))
- But this raises a question: What does it look like to “turn away” from myself? As I’ve pictured this, I’ve come to think of our ego—the you inside your head—as a six-sided hexagon. Each of the sides of this honeycomb is a window on the self. ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=954))
- In contrast to a noisy ego, ego volume is turned down by cultivating a quiet ego. With a quiet ego, your inner voice takes a break. The chatter lessens. Obsessive self-absorption wanes. A quiet ego allows you to turn away from yourself, returning your attention to the world and others. You become emotionally, physically, and mentally present. ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=963))
- Research has found that a quieter ego5 is associated with increased self-esteem, greater life satisfaction, happiness, psychological resilience, and greater meaning in life. The science is clear: we need to turn down the volume. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=966))
- Turns out, one of the most toxic things for our mental health is what psychologists call depressive rumination. Depressive rumination occurs when our thoughts fixate on, attach to, and swirl around some loss, fear, wound, failure, shame, hurt, or inadequacy. When we ruminate, we pick at our emotional scabs, never allowing them to heal. ([Location 976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=976))
- Beck eventually concluded that what his clients needed was to step away from their thoughts in order to adopt a more critical and objective perspective on their internal chatter. Beck called this stepping back distancing, and it became a vital part of his new approach to treating depression. In one of the most pivotal moments in modern psychological history, Aaron Beck left Freud behind to become the founder of what would later become cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=980))
- Aaron Beck’s CBT was the first psychological treatment to scientifically demonstrate clinical effectiveness across a wide range of mood, personality, and behavioral disorders. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=985))
- And all of this success is rooted in a very simple idea: take a step back from yourself. ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=990))
- For example, research has shown a simple and effective way8 to disentangle yourself from your inner chatter: You can change your inner pronouns when you talk to yourself. Instead of using “I” in your inner dialogue, you can substitute your first name. Or switch from “I” to “you.” Rather than thinking “What do I want?” I can practice thinking “What does Richard want?” Psychologists describe this technique as self-distancing, a simple tool that helps you gain a more objective view of yourself. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=993))
- You can also practice self-distancing by talking to yourself like a friend. This “best friend technique” is a simple self-care recommendation used by just about every therapist in the world. When we’re wrestling with hard decisions or struggling with negative emotions, rather than getting overwhelmed with a tidal wave of thoughts and feelings, can we stop and ask ourselves, “If my best friend were going through something like this, what would I say to them?” ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=998))
- Self-distancing techniques—changing your inner pronouns or talking to yourself like a friend—might seem trivial, but they are powerful tools in cultivating emotional health and resiliency. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1002))
- The process of cognitive restructuring involves attending to our thoughts in order to challenge and modify them when they are unhelpful or inaccurate. A central goal of CBT is to help clients replace dysfunctional and self-defeating thoughts with healthier thinking. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1008))
- Perhaps CBT wasn’t as distanced as it could be. Following that idea, the psychologist Steven Hayes pioneered what would become acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). In contrast to CBT, ACT argues that, when it comes to our thinking, we need comprehensive distancing. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1014))
- Since the 1990s, acceptance-based approaches have become one of the influential movements in the field of psychotherapy. According to acceptance-based therapies, rather than monitoring and trying to change your thoughts—grabbing the flypaper—you are encouraged to sit back and merely observe your thoughts. You don’t engage your inner chatter; you simply note it and let it go. When we have negative thoughts, we simply accept that the thought is there. We don’t try to talk back to it, change it, or remove it. We don’t debate ourselves. We let the thoughts pass. Like clouds floating by. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1026))
- Practicing this comprehensive distancing from the voice in our heads has proven to be remarkably effective. Since its introduction, ACT has shown9 itself to be as effective as CBT in treating mental and behavioral disorders and often outperforms CBT. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1031))
- First, notice this: from CBT’s distancing to the comprehensive distancing of acceptance-based approaches, two of the most effective and versatile psychotherapies in the world involve stepping away from your thoughts. I’ll say it again: Freud was wrong. Chasing thoughts inside our heads isn’t a recipe for happiness. ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1035))
- The second thing to notice is how mindfulness, through comprehensive distancing, is taking center stage in modern psychotherapies. Mindfulness is now widely considered to be one of the simplest and most effective techniques in our therapeutic and self-care toolkits. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1038))
- Grounded in Eastern spiritual traditions, mindfulness involves practicing a nonjudgmental attention to the present moment. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1040))
- Critical to mindfulness practice, when you notice your mind racing off like this, is that you don’t judge the mental wandering. You simply let go of the thoughts, noting them but patiently and nonjudgmentally returning your attention back toward your breathing. Starting off, this practice can be very difficult. But over time, it becomes easier to stay present and focused. The ego volume gets turned down. Your mind becomes practiced in quieting itself. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1046))
- Beyond meditation, we can also practice mindfulness in daily life whenever we experience stressful or triggering situations. Stop where you are and take ten slow breaths, attending to your breathing. Beyond breathing, you can also become more mindful of your surroundings. Whenever you’re getting caught up in your thoughts or overwhelmed by your feelings, stop and notice five things that you can see. Then notice five things you can hear. Then five things you are touching. Finally, try to notice all these things at once. Simple grounding techniques like this pull you out of your head and quiet your ego. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1049))
- The practices of contemplative prayer, by contrast, don’t involve “talking” to God. Like mindfulness, contemplative prayer quiets the ego. Focus is often still directed on our breathing, with words of prayer repeated on breathing in and breathing out. The critical spiritual difference between mindfulness and contemplative prayer is the contrast between therapeutic technique and transcendent encounter. In contemplative prayer, we expect to meet a Presence in the quietness, a Voice of peace and love that is not my own. As Thomas Merton described it, “Contemplation is essentially10 a listening in silence, an expectancy.” In quieting the ego, we listen for the “still small voice” at the center of our being, a voice that is impossible to hear with a noisy, scattered, and anxious mind. ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1057))
- Our journey toward joy begins here in this silence, with the quieting of your ego. We start with the simplest of recommendations: Take a step back from yourself. Turn away from the chatter of your wandering mind. Don’t grab the flypaper of your thoughts. Practice comprehensive self-distancing through practices of mindfulness and contemplative prayer. Let your mind learn to quiet itself. Take that volume knob attached to your ego and turn it all the way down. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1067))
- Did you know that humility is the foundation of happiness? ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1098))
- Research has shown how humility helps us cope with life stress and trauma, from dealing with everyday relational problems to the death of a close friend. Humility also protects you from mental health issues1, from anxiety to depression. ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1111))
- To be sure, humility is concerned with how we stand in relation to ourselves, but humility isn’t about punching holes in our egos. Humility has nothing to do with humiliation. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1117))
- No, the humblest people we know are quite secure, talented, and accomplished. The critical difference is that they carry those accomplishments and skills very, very lightly. They don’t brag or boast. They don’t need to be the smartest or most successful person in the room. Humble people don’t need to win every argument. They don’t namedrop. They don’t anxiously pad their résumés or feel the need to toot their own horn. Humble people are more interested in you than they are in themselves. ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1121))
- Simply put, humility isn’t about being self-critical; it is, rather, being less invested and wrapped up in yourself. This is why egoistical and competitive people are anxious. Narcissists are compensating for felt insecurities. Humble people, by contrast, are secure in their own skin. And this comfort with themselves allows humble people to step away from social games of self-promotion and one-upmanship. ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1125))

- According to Tangney, humble people possess the following qualities: An accurate assessment of yourself An ability to acknowledge your mistakes and limitations An openness to other viewpoints and ideas An ability to keep your accomplishments in perspective A low self-focus An appreciation of the value of all things, including other people ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1137))
- Joseph Chancellor and Sonja Lyubomirsky. Humble people possess or are characterized by the following: A secure, self-accepting identity A view of yourself free from distortion An openness to new information, being teachable Being other-focused rather than self-focused Possessing egalitarian beliefs, that is, seeing others as having the same intrinsic value/importance as oneself; lacking feelings of superiority ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1143))
- Regarding intrapersonal traits, how I stand in relation to myself, humble people possess an accurate, rather than distorted, view of themselves. I don’t falsely inflate my ego, but neither do I disparage myself and tear myself down. Humble people see themselves clearly. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1151))
- Phrased another way, humble people accept themselves, which creates a secure and grounded personality. This groundedness, this comfort with yourself, allows humble people to admit mistakes, listen to others, welcome difference, and accept critical feedback. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1153))
- Humble people aren’t paralyzed by a fear of making a mistake in front of others. Humble people can, in the words of Brené Brown, “dare greatly” because they are not afraid to fail. ([Location 1155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1155))
- Last, and building on what we learned about the quiet ego and our internal chatter, humble people aren’t curved inward upon themselves. Humble people aren’t self-focused and self-absorbed. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1156))
- Regarding interpersonal and relational qualities, humble people, since they aren’t looking at themselves, are able to direct their attention outward toward others. This allows humble people to view the people around them as valuable and important. ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1158))
- Humble people, since they lack huge egos, accept feedback, show interest in the opinions of others, and get along well with others. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1161))
- Self-focused people aren’t very good listeners. ([Location 1178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1178))
- Other-focused people, by contrast, can more easily and quickly set their interests aside to attend to the needs of those around them. Given how their attention is directed outward, humble people are much more alert to the needs of others and quick to spot them. Other-oriented people can be present with others. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1181))
- Humility involves being self-forgetful, just not thinking all that much about yourself. A self-forgetting ego is called hypo-egoic. A famous quote sums it up well: “True humility is not thinking less of yourself; it’s thinking of yourself less.” ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1185))
- In this Goldilocks game of self-esteem, humility is the lever we feel we have to pull when we experience success. The fear is that if we don’t, we’ll puff up with pride. That this entire enterprise is counterproductive should come as no surprise. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1200))
- And it’s exhausting for both parents and children to constantly manipulate a child’s ego with praise or criticism. ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1203))
- Humility isn’t about putting ourselves down. The point of humility isn’t to think less of yourself but to think less about yourself. ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1205))
- Humility is, rather, stepping away from self-evaluation altogether. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1209))
- Recall how I described humility as flowing from a secure and stable identity. Humble people are grounded and comfortable with themselves. ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1218))
- When we describe our identity as stable, we mean that our ego is nonreactive in the face of life events. Unfortunately, though, most of us have a superhero complex, playing some game of significance. Consequently, our identity is tightly connected to some metric of “winning” or “losing.” Psychologists describe this as a conditional or contingent self-esteem. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1219))
- This reactive ego is fragile and unstable. A secure and stable ego, by contrast, is grounded and nonreactive. A failure or setback isn’t a shock to my identity or a commentary on my worth. ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1226))
- The secret to achieving this sort of grounded stability is the secret we’ve been talking about: stepping away from yourself. More specifically, you have to put some emotional distance between your identity and the conditions of worth of your superhero complex. ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1228))
- Humility isn’t about denigrating yourself, the player of the hero game. Humility is giving up the hero game. Humility is turning away from the conditions of worth that fragilize and destabilize your identity. ([Location 1232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1232))
- The healthy ego isn’t a vacuum or a hole. Joy is rooted in the durable conviction that your life has significance and value. Psychologists describe this conviction as unconditional self-worth, in contrast to the instability and reactivity of the conditional, contingent self-worth of the superhero complex. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1242))
- A newer label for this conviction, that you are worthy of love and belonging, is mattering. Mattering means your life matters, no matter what. Importantly, mattering isn’t earned. Mattering is a given. Mattering is an existential fact of your existence, a value that cannot be lost or eclipsed. This unconditional value stabilizes the ego, extracting it from the successes and failures of our hero game. ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1244))
- But for now, let’s put a pin in this conversation to simply note that mattering, a felt sense of worthiness that is an unconditional given of your existence, stabilizes and grounds the ego, allowing us to be less reactive to the ups and downs of life. Mattering is a psychological anchor in the storms of life. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1252))
- Joy starts with an ego that is quiet, where the chatter of the inner voice is turned down. When our ego volume is low, we become able to forget ourselves. This allows us to become focused outwardly toward others. We’re able to be present. We can do this because our identities are stable and grounded. Having turned away from our superhero complex, our egos are no longer reactive and triggered by our successes and failures. This serenity of soul is grounded in the conviction that our lives matter, that we are worthy of love and belonging. Our self-worth is secure because our value is unconditional, a durable truth about our lives, rather than something variable and contingent. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1257))
- Our lives are full of moments of transcendent wonder and amazement. We stare at natural wonders like Niagara Falls and exclaim, “Wow!” or “Whoa!” We might grow silent and speechless. Nature can strike us dumb with its power and grandeur. But the wonders of the natural world can also be more fleeting and delicate. Here in Texas, the bluebonnets interrupt me every spring, as does the Monarch butterfly migration every fall. We stand under starry skies, walk sandy beaches, and climb cathedral mountains. We’ve all been surprised by awe. ([Location 1293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1293))
- Psychologists have discovered that one of the most common sources of awe is witnessing acts of what psychologists describe as “moral beauty.” We observe acts of heroic sacrifice and courage, and our souls are stirred. Bearing witness to love is a miraculous thing. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1298))
- The psychologist Dacher Keltner, a world expert1 in the science of awe, has defined awe as “the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your current understanding of the world.” As a feeling, awe is associated with emotions of amazement, wonder, flow, bliss, ecstasy, euphoria, and joy. But crucially for our exploration concerning the shape of joy, awe is prompted by a “presence,” a presence that “transcends” normal everyday experience. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1302))
- Here with awe, we are, finally, pulled out of ourselves. Awe flips the curvature of the self. With wonder, the collapse of the modern self is reversed. No longer turned inward, awe directs our gaze outward. In the experience of awe, we begin to make what I call the outward turn. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1309))
- Wonder affects the ego and reconfigures our sense of self. Awe creates a capacity for self-transcendence, which completes our honeycomb tour of the ego and brings us to the threshold of joy. Awe has this effect by creating what psychologists call the small self. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1313))
- That big ego is noisy. The superhero complex is out of control. Because of this, the ego occupies a large territory in self-consciousness, leaves a bigger footprint in the psyche, which pushes the needs and considerations of others to the margins. People with big egos are selfish due to their self-absorption, only concerned with their agendas and desires. When your ego gets too big, it blocks your view of the world, blinding you to the concerns of the people around you. ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1319))
- However, when we encounter something bigger than ourselves, something transcendent, the experience of awe pulls us out of our heads and away from our internal chatter. In relation to this larger reality, I adjust the “size” of myself. I recalibrate my ego in light of an encounter with a bigger, wider world. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1323))
- Many of today’s social ills arise out of an overactive default self, augmented by self-obsessed digital technologies. Awe, it seems, quiets this urgent voice of the default self.” ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1329))
- Triggered by awe, a smaller ego is able to get out of its own way to find its place in the larger pattern of things. The small self is a felt sense of unity and oneness within a whole. We see ourselves as a piece of a much larger puzzle. ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1331))
- And as we find our vital and proper place in the world, we come to recognize and honor the webs of reciprocity, mutuality, and dependency that connect us to each other and to the natural world. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1333))
- With a smaller ego, I also face my limitations and finitude, adopting a healthier perspective about what I can and cannot realistically expect of myself. ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1334))
- I also refuse to stand pridefully isolated, autonomous, independent, and alone, cutting myself off from the world and others. I embrace my dependency. I admit that I need you. I also come to recognize the urgent moral demands placed on me by reality, what the natural world and fellow human beings require by way of recognition, respect, and care. For all things, we come to see, stand or fall together. We share a common life and fate. ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1336))
- In pulling us out of ourselves and into a relationship with the world, awe draws us closer together. Our big and noisy egos shrink in size, and a capacity for intimacy and connection is cultivated. Our hearts begin to swell. Transcendence draws us into love. ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1342))
- The research points to humility and toward a smaller, quieter self that is self-forgetful and more mindful, sensitive and attuned to the world around us and the needs of others. ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1350))
- From another angle, we need a stable, nonreactive identity. When we’re overly invested in the successes and failures of our superhero complex, it’s hard to keep the ego quiet and small. When our value is tethered to conditions of worth, our emotions swing up and down, swaying like a boat on a stormy ocean. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1351))
- Of course, failures still sting. Rejections still wound. But when we matter, as waves of life crash over us, our value remains stable, grounded, and unconditional. Something very deep within us remains untouched, a place where we feel safe, tranquil, and secure. ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1354))
- Well, if we’ve learned anything so far, we’ve learned this much: We aren’t going to find this security within ourselves. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1358))
- The science of awe, along with those nagging questions about the source of our mattering, has been pointing us toward our final destination: transcendence. ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1362))
- The science of awe has pointed the way. We leave the shadowy cave of the modern self, with all its chattering, anxious noise, to stand dazzled and amazed at something outside of ourselves. But if that is so, we quickly face a pressing, burning question: What lies beyond the cave? Is there a reality and truth to be found outside ourselves? What are we turning toward when we turn away from ourselves? ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1421))
- Let me be brutally honest. Psychologists who study joy and happiness are coy on this point. They know the research, but almost every book and podcast on the market sharing the science of joy, awe, gratitude, meaning in life, mattering, happiness, and human flourishing hedges on this central question, the question of transcendence. ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1444))
- Transcendence is the secret to joy. Faith and spirituality are good for your mental health. Study after study has shown this2. Joy has a shape. The secret to happiness is turning outward. But the question nags: Is any of this invisible, spiritual stuff really real? ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1448))
- Science knows the direction of joy and is happy to hand you a map, but science is silent on the source of joy. ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1452))
- Of course, the rebuttal here is that faith and spirituality are simply projections, like a movie camera, of our own inner lives on a mute, blank existence. There’s no meaning out there in the world, only the meaning we impose on reality. ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1456))
- If these values are just “me” written in disguise, the self staring at itself in a mirror, I’m still chasing my own tail. I remain lost within myself, looking for answers that I do not have. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1479))
    - Note: potential counterpoint: maybe being able to see beyond the big ego to the small self is the point. So far, I am suspicious that we may be coming upon a conflation of universal and true. A source of transcendence needs to be true but it does not need to be universal. Maybe the broader conclusion will get there too. We will see.
- To say values are subjective is to say there is nothing independent of our own minds . . . [that our values] do not track a reality which is “there anyway.” According to his picture, values are determined, not discovered, and selfhood—what it means to be a person—is therefore fundamentally about choice, not vision. It is about picking a course of action arbitrarily, not about seeing a reality that transcends you—goodness—and integrating with it. ([Location 1483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1483))
    - Note: Or it could be that values are real but there are so many of them that people can legitimately make different choices
- In light of that heavy burden, we need to step out of the cave and into the sunlight to receive a value—a transcendent source of mattering—that exists independently of our successes and failures. Mattering isn’t a subjective game of self-delusion or a therapeutic mind hack. Mattering exists beyond your depression. ([Location 1496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1496))
- Mattering exists. Mattering is an objective truth discovered outside the cave of your mind. Your value is a fact that exists beyond your self-assessment. Your mattering is a constituent part of the cosmos, as real as gravity and groundhogs. ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1500))
- Some values are not up for grabs. Some values are simply true. And our mental health depends on these truths. As James Mumford concludes, we need to encourage those struggling with mental health issues “to search for values6 beyond themselves.” ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1502))
- The Dutch describe ietism, which roughly translates as “Something-ism,” the conviction that there is Something out there in the universe that anchors our values and gives life deeper meaning. ([Location 1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1509))
- For most of human history, it was the material, physical, and factual world—the world that we can see, smell, taste, and touch—the was fleeting, corruptible, mutable, unstable, and changing. The material world was ghostly and spectral. What our senses revealed couldn’t be trusted. The physical world was the world of the cave, the realm of illusions and shadows. The transcendent, spiritual world, by contrast, was real, solid, constant, secure, permanent, and unchanging. The spiritual realm was where transcendent values were located—truth, beauty, and goodness. These values blazed steady and eternal in contrast to the fleeting shadows of the material world. ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1515))
- James describes our encounter with transcendence as a “reality-feeling,” what could be described as an ontological intuition or an ontological emotion. Ontology is the word philosophers use to describe the nature of existence, what we consider to be “real.” In our encounter with transcendence, we intuit, feel, or experience that Something or Someone is there, something solid and real, a Something or Someone that exists independently of and outside of my own consciousness and experience. ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1532))
    - Note: If we're going to put this base that the idea that there is a reality, a real something beyond the self, then I can see that.
- As William James described it, in our encounter with transcendence, I experience a “sense of reality,7 a feeling of objective presence, a perception of what we may call ‘something there,’ more deep and more general than any of the special and particular ‘senses’ by which current psychology supposes existent realities to be originally revealed.” ([Location 1535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1535))
- Consequently, I don’t experience transcendence as a “subjective” state, as the product and projection of my own mind imposing an image on a blank canvas, like a movie projection on a screen. During an experience of awe or in a religious encounter with God, I’m not locked in the cave of my own mind. I have, rather, bumped into Something outside of myself. ([Location 1539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1539))
- Transcendence is experienced as “objective,” an encounter with a Reality that exists independently of myself. And here lies the psychological power and potential of transcendence: the possibility of being pulled out of yourself and into a richer, deeper, fuller, and more multicolored reality. ([Location 1542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1542))
- And yet the objective realities we experience in transcendence escape any material or scientific description. As a spiritual encounter with Reality, what we intuit is invisible and cannot be detected by any tool of empirical measurement. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1545))
- We are regularly amazed at things outside of our heads but wonder if, in the end, it was all just inside of our heads. ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1549))
- Something transcendent and sacred shines in humans. Shines out, really, from all of reality. And this light, if you pause to notice it, affects you. Tugs on you. Makes demands of you. Calls to you. Nudges you. You’re in a relationship with this light. You recognize it, accommodate it, nurture it, and care for it. The world is immersed in a radiant light, a shining brilliance that pulls you, if you let it, out of yourself and into life. ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1564))
- A resonant encounter with life is suffused with significance, significances that concern us. These concerns pull us away from narcissistic self-absorption or depressive self-rumination. A resonant encounter with the world is to recognize a sacred presence. Emotions of gratitude, wonder, and love swirl here. ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1569))
- It’s easy to see how nature can amaze us. Nature is visible, and few would doubt the reality of Niagara Falls. But research has shown that goodness—value itself—is the most potent and powerful source of awe. More moving than nature itself and any natural wonder. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1572))
- “What most commonly led people around the world to feel awe? Nature? Spiritual practice? Listening to music? In fact, it was other people’s courage, kindness, strength or overcoming. Around the world, we are most likely to feel awe when moved by moral beauty. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1576))

- Transcendent values, the invisible facts of the world, from the intrinsic worth of human beings to the moral values that guide righteous action, cannot be detected by any invention of science. Yet these invisible facts are the most potent force in our lives—guiding our steps, shaping our judgments, informing our choices, forming our character, nurturing our dreams, and guiding our hearts. Your life is pushed and pulled by tidal forces far more powerful than the law of gravity. ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CTJFKQVX&location=1581))
- The word transcendence comes from Latin words meaning “to go beyond.” Joy starts by going beyond yourself. And that includes your doubts and skepticism. It’s not enough to step back from yourself, as helpful as that is. You have to step outside. The invisible facts of the world are shining around you.

- And given that neoliberal competition is a contest of king of the hill, 99.99 percent of us are going to fail to summit the mountain of our dreams.

- Here’s what I meant. It’s easy to tell people they matter, to insist that they need to recognize a transcendent truth about themselves.

- But if you don’t come from a spiritual tradition, here’s the best advice I can give you: Surround yourself with people who tell you that you matter—and unconditionally so.

- Basically, if you don’t believe—or can’t believe—that you cosmically and existentially matter, you can find ways to socially and relationally matter. You can matter to someone.

### Assistant - 2025-03-17 18:08:44

Based on your highlights from *The Shape of Joy*, the themes that resonated most with you seem to revolve around the following key ideas:

### **1. Joy is Found in How We Face Our Worst Days**
Beck repeatedly returns to the question of how we endure suffering, loss, and failure. Your highlights suggest that this idea stood out to you—particularly the assertion that true joy is not found in moments of happiness but in how we respond to hardship. The concept that "life is a final exam with only one question: how do you face your worst day?" seems particularly striking.

### **2. The Modern Self is Trapped in Itself**
The book critiques the inward turn of the self, drawing on thinkers like Charles Taylor and Descartes to argue that modern identity has become self-absorbed. You highlighted passages about the collapse of the self into an inward focus, which Beck argues has led to increased despair, instability, and mental health crises. The contrast between the “curved inward” self (incurvatus in se) and the “curved outward” self (excurvatus ex se) was a major theme for you.

### **3. Transcendence as the Answer**
A recurring idea in your highlights is that transcendence—looking beyond oneself to something greater—is key to finding joy and psychological stability. Beck contrasts transcendence with modern self-help techniques that keep a person trapped in their own mind. You flagged his argument that true grace and meaning come from beyond oneself rather than from self-affirmation tricks.

### **4. The Hero Game and the Exhaustion of Self-Esteem**
Beck critiques the "hero game"—the idea that people are constantly trying to achieve significance, status, and self-worth through comparison, competition, and external validation. Your highlights show a strong engagement with his argument that this status-seeking behavior is exhausting and ultimately self-defeating. The passages about self-esteem being a never-ending and unstable project particularly resonated with you.

### **5. Humility and the Quiet Ego**
Beck suggests that the antidote to the self-absorbed, competitive, and anxious modern identity is humility. You marked several passages about the qualities of humble people—how they are secure in themselves, not obsessed with performance, and are able to turn outward. The idea that humility quiets the ego and creates a more stable sense of self was clearly important to you.

### **6. Awe and the Small Self**
Another key takeaway from your highlights is the discussion on awe. Beck argues that experiencing awe—whether in nature, in acts of moral beauty, or in spiritual encounters—reshapes the self by making it "smaller" and more attuned to something beyond itself. You marked several passages about how awe interrupts self-focus and brings people into deeper connection with the world and others.

### **7. Mattering as the Foundation of Mental Health**
You seemed particularly engaged with Beck’s discussion of *mattering*—the idea that a stable sense of self-worth is crucial for well-being. He differentiates between *relational mattering* (feeling valued by others) and *existential mattering* (believing your life has cosmic significance). Your highlights suggest you were interested in how this idea bridges the gap between secular and spiritual perspectives.

### **8. The Dangers of Competitive Culture and Social Media**
Beck’s critique of neoliberalism, status anxiety, and social media’s role in exacerbating comparison and isolation also seemed to strike a chord. You highlighted his argument that modern society has turned everything into a competition, making friendships transactional and social validation precarious. His discussion of loneliness as a modern epidemic also stood out to you.

### **9. Psychological Techniques: CBT, ACT, and Mindfulness**
You highlighted Beck’s discussion of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), which advocate *distancing* from one's thoughts rather than getting lost in them. His argument that mindfulness, self-distancing, and contemplative practices can quiet the ego and foster resilience seemed to align with your interests.

### **10. The Search for a Transcendent Reality**
Toward the end of your highlights, you seemed particularly drawn to Beck’s discussion of whether transcendence is real. You noted his claim that the experience of transcendence feels like an encounter with something beyond the self rather than a mere projection. Your annotations suggest a curiosity about whether transcendence needs to be *universal* to be *true*, as well as an interest in the secular possibilities of existential meaning.

---

### **Your Resonant Themes in One Sentence**
You were most drawn to Beck’s argument that joy is found in turning outward—away from the anxious, self-referential mind and toward humility, awe, transcendence, and a stable sense of mattering that is not dependent on achievement or status.

Would you say that captures it? And would you like your review to focus on any particular aspects of the book more than others?

### User - 2025-03-17 18:10:22

What are my criticisms, based mainly on my notes?

### Assistant - 2025-03-17 18:10:23

Based on your notes and annotations, here are the main critiques you seem to have about *The Shape of Joy*:

### **1. Possible Conflation of Universality and Truth**  
One of your notes questions whether Beck is conflating *universality* with *truth* in his argument about transcendence. He asserts that mattering is a cosmic fact rather than a subjective experience, but you raise the possibility that values could be real without being universal. This suggests a skepticism toward the idea that there is only *one* correct form of transcendence that applies to everyone.

### **2. Potential Over-Reliance on the Theological Framework**  
While you engage deeply with Beck’s argument that transcendence is necessary for joy, your notes suggest some hesitation about whether this must take the form of religious belief. You mention that a *secular* version of cosmic mattering might exist, implying that Beck may be too quick to assume that faith in something beyond oneself must take on a theological shape.

### **3. Skepticism Toward the "Objective" Nature of Transcendence**  
Your annotations reflect a questioning of Beck’s claim that transcendence is an encounter with an *external* reality rather than an internal psychological state. While you seem open to the idea that something beyond the self exists, you also note that transcendence might be a shift in perception rather than a metaphysical encounter. In particular, you push back against his dismissal of subjective values, suggesting that people can still make *legitimate* choices among competing values.

### **4. The Risk of Overgeneralization in His Critique of the Modern Self**  
Beck strongly criticizes the modern self as being “curved inward,” trapped in rumination, comparison, and self-esteem struggles. While you seem to agree with much of his argument, your notes suggest a potential counterpoint: is the issue really that all modern people are *too* self-focused, or is it that they struggle to develop *healthy* self-reflection? You might be wondering if Beck overstates the case in portraying the inwardly-focused self as entirely pathological.

### **5. The Framing of the "Hero Game" Might Be Too Absolute**  
Beck argues that the drive for status, achievement, and self-esteem is a “trap” that people must escape. But your notes indicate some ambivalence—do people *have* to abandon all hero games to find joy, or is it possible to engage with them in a more balanced, non-exhausting way? His rhetoric might imply an *all-or-nothing* approach that leaves little room for finding meaning within the very structures he critiques.

### **6. Questioning the Limits of Psychological Research on Transcendence**  
Beck often leans on psychological research to support his claims, but you noted that while science can point toward *patterns* (e.g., transcendence is associated with happiness), it remains silent on whether transcendence is *real*. Your notes imply that he might overextend the reach of psychological studies by presenting them as proving something metaphysical.

### **7. The Book's Approach to Doubt and Skepticism**  
One of your notes suggests you’re wary of how Beck treats doubt and skepticism, particularly when he writes that joy requires "going beyond" one’s doubts. Your comment hints at a concern that Beck might be undervaluing critical thinking in favor of an embrace of transcendence. Does he leave enough room for intellectually honest uncertainty?

### **8. A Possible Blind Spot in His Critique of Self-Reflection**  
Beck argues that turning inward is a dead-end, leading only to self-absorption and depression. Your notes raise the question of whether this is always the case. While you acknowledge the dangers of excessive rumination, you also seem to wonder if there is value in a more *balanced* inward reflection—one that fosters wisdom rather than self-obsession.

### **9. The Role of Social Connection vs. Cosmic Mattering**  
Beck presents *cosmic* mattering (the belief that one’s life has inherent value beyond personal achievements) as the ultimate foundation for joy. You note, however, that *social* mattering—feeling valued by others—can also serve as a powerful grounding force. Your notes suggest that he might downplay the possibility that relationships and community alone can provide sufficient meaning for some people.

---

### **Your Main Critique in One Sentence**
While you resonate deeply with Beck’s core argument about the need to turn outward, you push back on his tendency to universalize his conclusions, his potential overstatement of the problems of inward reflection, and his framing of transcendence as an objective reality rather than a personal or pluralistic experience.

Would you like me to incorporate these critiques into your review in a particular way—perhaps as a gentle pushback, or framed as lingering questions rather than firm objections?

## Review

## Reflections

- Did I learn? Did I acquire new information? Did I grow? Did the form of my understanding change?
    - Yes. This brought together some familiar findings in psychology and turned them on their head. It looked at how so much of the modern world tells us to turn inward but that inward turning just causes us to collapse in our ourselves.
    - Instead, we should turn outward, with a focus on what is real outside of us. 
- Was it well written? Was it structured well, coherent, beautiful?
    - Generally, yes
- Did I enjoy it? Do I look back upon it fondly?
    - Generally, yes
- Other thoughts
    - One thingi that frustrated me about the book is that Beck quibbled on the nature of that transcendent reality. Not that I expected him to make a case that there is or is not a god backing reality. The first argument is, in my opinion, impossible. The second argument is impossible for him as a Christian teaching at a Christian college. That said, the way that he would sometimes equivocate between a transcendent reality and a transcendent being got annoying at times.
    - In particular, this showed up in the importance of cosmic mattering.

# **Book Review: *The Shape of Joy* by Richard Beck**

Richard Beck’s *The Shape of Joy: The Transformative Power of Moving Beyond Yourself* takes a strikingly counterintuitive stance against one of the dominant messages of modern life: the idea that happiness and fulfillment come from turning inward. Through an engaging blend of psychology, philosophy, and theology, Beck argues that our culture’s obsession with self-exploration, self-improvement, and self-actualization has left us trapped within ourselves—curved inward in ways that make us anxious, lonely, and fragile. Instead of more self-focus, what we truly need is to turn outward, toward something real beyond ourselves.

At its best, *The Shape of Joy* is a fascinating synthesis of research and reflection. Beck challenges the prevailing self-esteem model of well-being, showing how it often traps people in an exhausting cycle of comparison, status-seeking, and insecurity. He argues that the real key to joy lies in humility, self-forgetfulness, and what he calls the “outward turn”—a shift away from self-absorption toward meaningful engagement with the world, with others, and ultimately, with transcendence. The book is structured around this shift, moving from an exploration of the modern self’s collapse (*Curved Inward*), through strategies for stepping away from self-preoccupation (*Turning Away*), and finally into the practices that cultivate an outwardly curved life (*Curved Outward*).

## **The Book’s Strengths**
One of the book’s great strengths is how it integrates familiar psychological insights into a fresh and provocative framework. Beck draws on research from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and mindfulness to show how our minds can become prisons of rumination and self-doubt. His discussion of the “hero game”—our constant, often unconscious striving for status and validation—feels particularly timely, especially in an era of social media-fueled comparison. He is persuasive in arguing that much of our suffering stems not from external circumstances but from the mental loops we trap ourselves in, desperately trying to prove our worth.

Similarly, Beck’s discussion of awe is one of the book’s most compelling threads. He draws on psychological studies to show how awe can reconfigure our sense of self, making us feel smaller in the best possible way—less consumed by our own concerns and more attuned to the vast, interconnected world around us. Whether through encounters with nature, acts of moral beauty, or moments of transcendence, awe has the power to loosen the stranglehold of the ego and invite us into a deeper and more joyous way of being.

## **Where the Book Falters: The Limits of Its Transcendent Vision**
However, *The Shape of Joy* also has its frustrations—particularly in how it engages (or fails to fully engage) with the nature of transcendence. Beck is writing as a Christian, and while he doesn’t turn the book into a theological argument, he often wavers uncomfortably between speaking about transcendence in a broad, universal way and implying a more specifically theistic conclusion. He repeatedly suggests that joy requires an encounter with something *real* beyond ourselves, but at times, his language equivocates between transcendence as a *reality* and transcendence as a *being*.

This ambiguity becomes most noticeable in his discussion of cosmic mattering—the idea that we need to believe our lives have intrinsic worth beyond our personal achievements or social relationships. Beck argues that existential well-being requires a source of value that is not contingent on external success or failure. This is a compelling argument, but it raises an important question: does this require belief in a divine reality, or can cosmic mattering be affirmed from a secular perspective? Beck never fully commits to an answer, and this wishy-washiness weakens the book. While he acknowledges that people can find meaning in relationships and community (*relational mattering*), he still presents *cosmic mattering*—a deeper, unshakable sense of worth—as the more foundational reality. This leaves secular readers in an awkward place. If one does not believe in a transcendent order, does that mean true joy is out of reach? Or is Beck’s argument flexible enough to accommodate secular forms of transcendence?

There is also the question of whether Beck overstates the pathology of inward reflection. While he makes a strong case against self-absorption and neurotic self-evaluation, he sometimes seems to imply that all inward exploration is misguided. Yet self-reflection can also be a source of wisdom, growth, and clarity—especially when balanced with external engagement. The problem may not be *inwardness* itself, but rather *the way* people turn inward. Here, the book’s framing can feel a bit rigid, as if all self-examination leads to stagnation rather than self-awareness.

## **Final Thoughts**
Despite these critiques, *The Shape of Joy* is an insightful and thought-provoking book that challenges many of the assumptions embedded in contemporary conversations about happiness and well-being. Beck makes a compelling case that true joy is not found in chasing self-esteem or constantly monitoring our status but in embracing a quieter, more outwardly-focused way of being. While his argument about transcendence would have been stronger with a clearer articulation of how secular and spiritual perspectives can coexist, the book still offers a valuable perspective on how to escape the mental traps of modern life.

For readers who are interested in the intersection of psychology, philosophy, and spirituality, *The Shape of Joy* provides an engaging and worthwhile read. It will resonate most with those who feel exhausted by the constant demands of self-improvement culture and are looking for a way to step outside of themselves—whether toward the vastness of the natural world, the beauty of human connection, or something even greater. However, those who approach transcendence from a more secular standpoint may find themselves wishing for a sharper and more inclusive articulation of its implications.

### Assistant - 2025-03-17 18:13:19

Richard Beck’s *The Shape of Joy* challenges the modern fixation on self-exploration, arguing that true joy is found not in turning inward but in directing our attention outward—toward others, the world, and something larger than ourselves. Blending psychology, philosophy, and theology, Beck critiques self-esteem culture and the endless pursuit of status, showing how these efforts often leave us anxious, lonely, and exhausted. Instead, he suggests that humility, awe, and a shift away from self-preoccupation create the conditions for a more stable, fulfilling life.

The book’s strongest moments come from its engagement with psychological research, particularly in dismantling the idea that happiness depends on self-validation. Beck’s discussion of awe is especially compelling—how encounters with nature, acts of moral beauty, or transcendent experiences can shrink the ego and quiet our inner turmoil. His critique of the “hero game,” where people chase self-worth through competition and comparison, also feels strikingly relevant in an age of social media.

However, Beck falters in his discussion of transcendence, often wavering between treating it as a broad psychological phenomenon and implying a more theistic conclusion. His argument for *cosmic mattering*—the idea that true stability comes from knowing one’s worth is unshakable and beyond personal achievement—is persuasive, but he never fully reconciles whether this must be grounded in a divine reality or if it can exist within a secular framework. This vagueness weakens the book, especially for readers who might seek a more inclusive articulation of meaning beyond religious belief. Additionally, while Beck rightly critiques self-absorption, his dismissal of inward reflection at times feels too absolute—self-examination, when balanced, can also lead to growth and clarity.

Despite these limitations, *The Shape of Joy* is a thought-provoking and well-written exploration of how to move beyond the traps of modern self-focus. It will resonate with those weary of the relentless push for self-optimization and looking for a different path to joy—one that is quieter, humbler, and more deeply connected to the world beyond the self.
