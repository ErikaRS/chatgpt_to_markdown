What's a more casual way of saying "Potential projects (ideas that the team can consider at their discretion)"? The potential projects are in contrast to "Key projects (projects we expect to ship in some form in this release cycle)"

A more casual way to phrase it could be:

"Possible Projects (just some ideas for the team to think about)" 

Contrasted with:

"Main Projects (stuff we're planning to roll out this time around)"
