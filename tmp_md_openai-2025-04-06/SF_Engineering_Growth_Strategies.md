I am head of engineering of a tech company that is globally distributed with only a few people in SF and only about 1/3 of the engineering team in the US.

The CEO wants to grow the eng team in SF rapidly but we've had trouble hiring in SF. Traditionally our hiring advantage was that we hired globally and our salary and product were seen as quite compelling to a globally distributed talent pool. 

The situation in SF is quite different with our salaries coming in below market and our product offering being seen as one of many in the AI coding assistant space. 

We are so desperate to grow in SF that we're considering aquihires, despite the high cost and the high variance of the talent. 

The CEO has charged me to future out creative ways to grow the eng org quickly without lowering our quality bar. 

Outline how I can approach this problem at a high level and then list 2 dozen ideas on how I can grow the org.

### High-Level Approach

To tackle this problem, the strategy should balance maintaining high standards, being creative with sourcing talent, and acknowledging the specific challenges of the San Francisco market. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Understand and Realign Value Proposition**: The company’s traditional value proposition is not resonating as strongly in SF. Reevaluate what might make your company stand out locally. Can you emphasize flexible work, remote options, unique opportunities for growth, or a stronger cultural fit?

2. **Explore Hybrid Models**: Given the difficulty in SF, explore a hybrid model, combining global hires with strategic SF placements. Not everyone has to be in SF, but certain roles or senior leadership could anchor the local team.

3. **Compete Beyond Salary**: While salaries are below market, consider enhancing the offer with equity, career development opportunities, flexible work arrangements, and unique benefits that appeal to SF talent.

4. **Inorganic Growth via Acqui-Hires**: Consider acqui-hires, but be highly selective. Focus on cultural fit, growth potential, and alignment with your long-term vision. Use this strategically, not as a quick fix.

5. **Leverage Internal Talent**: Identify opportunities for global team members to temporarily relocate to SF to support short-term growth while recruitment efforts continue.

6. **Work on Building Your Employer Brand**: Competing in a crowded field like AI coding assistants means standing out. Showcase your mission, values, and what makes working for your company a unique experience.

### 24 Ideas for Growing the Engineering Org

1. **Revisit Remote Hiring**: Even with the SF push, continue tapping into global talent. Establish SF-based team leads, but allow distributed workforces to contribute.

2. **Build a Strong Internship Program**: Create an SF-based internship program with local universities (e.g., Stanford, Berkeley) to attract promising early-career engineers.

3. **Leverage SF Meetups/Conferences**: Increase the company’s visibility in SF by hosting or sponsoring tech meetups, hackathons, or conferences, potentially drawing in engineers interested in your space.

4. **Improve Equity and Benefits Packages**: While salaries might be below market, offering better equity or non-salary perks (e.g., work-from-anywhere for part of the year, wellness programs) can make you more competitive.

5. **Optimize Referral Programs**: Offer significant bonuses or incentives for SF-based employee referrals, encouraging your team to reach out to their networks.

6. **Strategic Acqui-Hires**: Focus on small, struggling teams or startups where cultural fit aligns. Carefully evaluate talent beyond surface-level CVs.

7. **Offer Relocation Packages**: Attract global talent to SF by offering generous relocation packages for top-tier engineers, perhaps targeting countries with lower living costs.

8. **Host a Tech Challenge Competition**: Organize coding challenges open to SF-based engineers. Use it as both a recruitment tool and a branding exercise.

9. **Develop a Local University Recruiting Pipeline**: Collaborate with university career services to create a pipeline of fresh engineering graduates from SF-based schools.

10. **Nurture Strategic Partnerships with Bootcamps**: Work closely with coding bootcamps in SF, offering top graduates a fast-track path to interviews.

11. **Hire Industry-Specific Recruiters**: Bring on recruiters with deep experience in hiring in the SF tech market. Leverage their networks and local expertise.

12. **Leverage Visa Programs**: Utilize programs like the H1-B to bring international talent into SF when possible, targeting skilled engineers globally who may want to relocate.

13. **Emphasize Work-Life Balance**: Highlight how your company's policies support a healthier work-life balance compared to the intense SF tech culture.

14. **Offer Sabbatical Programs**: Attract high-caliber candidates with unique perks like a sabbatical program after a set number of years, which is not always common in SF.

15. **Outsource Certain Roles**: For non-core engineering functions, consider outsourcing to engineering agencies or contractors, allowing the SF team to focus on more strategic roles.

16. **Flexible Remote/In-Office Options**: Offer engineers the flexibility of working remotely most of the time, coming into the SF office only occasionally, to broaden your talent pool.

17. **Highlight Social Impact**: Position your company’s AI coding assistant as having a greater mission beyond just market competition, appealing to engineers motivated by impact.

18. **Engage Tech Thought Leaders**: Partner with or bring on prominent figures in AI coding to consult or evangelize for the company, attracting engineers who admire their work.

19. **Engineer Swap Programs**: Establish temporary exchanges where engineers from global offices can work from SF for a few months to help the SF office grow and establish culture.

20. **Direct Outreach to Engineers in SF**: Actively seek out SF-based engineers on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through open-source contributions and initiate personalized recruitment outreach.

21. **Offer Partial Remote Contracts**: Provide SF-based engineers with an option for partially remote contracts, targeting those who want the flexibility of moving in and out of SF.

22. **Engage with VC Networks**: Work with your investors or VCs who have access to networks of engineers and talent from previous startups or connections.

23. **Open Small Satellite Offices**: Consider opening satellite offices in less competitive yet still appealing locations like Austin, Denver, or Seattle, and allow remote work in SF from those offices.

24. **Use Employer Branding Channels**: Highlight your work culture and growth opportunities on platforms like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Blind, where potential candidates might be exploring alternative options.

By addressing the core challenge and implementing some of these strategies, you can grow your SF engineering team while maintaining the high standards that have contributed to your global success.

Focus in on ideas (these or others) that apply in the situation where the CEO (who is one of the cofounders) wants to evolve the company into a SF hot startup style company where people are driven to work long days and 6-7 days a week. Also include the challenge that many of the employees at this company, including me as head of engineering, are skeptical of this change, both that it would help and that it is possible to transform an 11 year old fully global company into a hot SF startup in the year it would have to do so to be able to get back to the levels of efficiency needed to hit the growth targets. 

Note that the skepticism isn't about whether or not it would be better if we could wave a wand and all be together. It's about the transformation itself. 

The reason I am bringing up the skepticism and the current geographic distribution is that it adds another challenge. The team will have a hard time sincerely selling the company to others after such a fundamental shift.

The CEO, one of the cofounders, wants to evolve the company into an SF hot startup style, where people are driven to work long days and 6-7 days a week. The user, along with many employees, is skeptical that this change will help or that it is possible to transform an 11-year-old fully global company into a hot SF startup within the timeframe needed to hit the company's growth targets. This skepticism is not about whether it would be ideal to be co-located, but about whether the transformation itself is feasible, given the current distribution and culture. The team will find it hard to sincerely sell the company to others after such a fundamental shift.

Given the challenge of transforming an 11-year-old global company into a high-pressure, SF-style "hot startup" in a short timeframe, along with the skepticism among existing employees (including yourself), any strategy for growing the engineering team will need to address the deeper concerns around the feasibility and desirability of such a shift. Here’s a tailored approach that takes into account the specific dynamics you're facing:

### High-Level Strategy:
1. **Acknowledge the Reality of Skepticism**: The skepticism among existing employees needs to be addressed head-on. Before focusing on recruiting, it's essential to have internal alignment or at least a well-articulated company vision that acknowledges the doubts and provides a roadmap for how this transformation will unfold.
   
2. **Maintain Dual Narratives**: Instead of selling the shift as an immediate, wholesale transformation, frame it as an evolution. This would allow for recruiting efforts that cater to SF-style talent without alienating current global employees or creating a cultural rift.

3. **Evaluate the Cost of Cultural Mismatch**: The skepticism may limit the team’s ability to authentically recruit SF talent. This must be part of the conversation with leadership—there may need to be a more gradual or hybrid approach that combines global and SF growth.

### Specific Ideas for Growth, Aligned with the CEO’s Vision but Attuned to the Reality:

1. **Lean into SF Hype**: Create a strong PR campaign around the transformation, emphasizing any exciting new partnerships, funding, or innovation. This can generate the “buzz” that SF startups thrive on and potentially attract more startup-style engineers.

2. **Strategic Acqui-Hires with SF Culture**: Focus acqui-hires on teams that already embody the startup culture the CEO wants. This allows for quick cultural infusion, though these hires must be managed to prevent a clash with the existing global culture.

3. **Create a 'Hot Startup' Core Team in SF**: Rather than trying to immediately convert the whole company, establish a new “core team” in SF that will operate with the intensity, focus, and cultural values the CEO envisions. This core team can be marketed to new hires as the flagship team for the company’s future, while other teams globally can maintain more traditional or hybrid models.

4. **Selective Recruiting for Founders or Early Startup Members**: Specifically target individuals who have been part of startups that have had successful exits or IPOs. These individuals often thrive in environments where long hours and intense dedication are the norm, and they understand the high-stakes nature of the work.

5. **Offer Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) Roles**: Attract SF startup talent by offering EIR roles or opportunities for entrepreneurial engineers to lead high-impact projects within your company. This can appeal to engineers who are motivated by ownership and potential future leadership roles.

6. **Highlight the Opportunity for Innovation**: Even if the product is one of many in the AI coding space, emphasize the company's willingness to pivot and innovate. Engineers drawn to the SF startup scene are often motivated by opportunities to build groundbreaking features or shape the direction of a company.

7. **Implement Time-Limited, High-Intensity Projects**: Introduce SF-style sprint projects, where teams come together for a short period (6-12 months) to work with the intensity expected in a startup. Market these projects as high-risk, high-reward opportunities for engineers who want to make a big impact.

8. **Incorporate High-Visibility Leaders or Advisors**: Bringing on board well-known figures in the SF startup ecosystem as advisors or senior leaders can generate excitement and make the company feel more like a hot startup to prospective engineers.

9. **Reframe the Company’s “Age” as an Advantage**: While being 11 years old may seem at odds with the hot startup image, highlight the fact that the company has the stability and resources that many startups don’t. Market this as a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of startup culture and established business security.

10. **Differentiate Your Product with Ambitious Claims**: Even if your product is one of many, focus on differentiating it with bold, ambitious claims that appeal to engineers wanting to make a big impact. This could involve pivoting into underexplored areas or emphasizing your AI’s potential beyond its current use.

11. **Emphasize Equity and Wealth-Building Opportunities**: SF engineers are often drawn to opportunities where they can gain substantial equity and be part of a company’s financial success. Increase equity offers for SF hires, making it clear that success in the company’s future can be as lucrative as early-stage startups.

12. **Incentivize Internal Mobility to SF**: For existing global employees who might be interested in moving to SF, create pathways for internal mobility, with financial incentives, relocation packages, and leadership opportunities.

13. **Create an 'Intensity Track'**: Offer an optional track within the company where employees can opt into a more intense work environment (with corresponding compensation and equity). This can help recruit SF startup-style talent without forcing the entire organization into that culture immediately.

14. **Build Leadership in SF from Within**: Identify internal leaders who could lead the SF charge. By having someone who understands the company’s history and culture lead the new SF initiative, you may mitigate some skepticism and ensure smoother alignment.

15. **High-Profile Event Partnerships**: Partner with SF-based tech conferences, meetups, or hackathons. Being visible in these forums helps position the company as part of the SF startup ecosystem.

16. **Offer Project-Based Contracts for SF Talent**: Rather than fully committing to full-time SF hires, bring on engineers for high-impact, short-term projects. This could serve as a “try before you buy” approach, helping the company assess fit and allowing engineers to experience the culture before committing.

17. **Create SF Office Events with Influential Speakers**: Host events at your SF office where prominent figures in tech come to speak. These events create networking opportunities and showcase the company as a significant player in SF.

18. **Use SF Recruiting Agencies Specializing in Startups**: Partner with recruiting firms that have deep connections to the SF startup scene. These agencies can help source startup-style engineers who are likely to thrive in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment.

19. **Focus on Short-Term Wins to Demonstrate Feasibility**: To combat internal skepticism, set clear short-term milestones that show the transformation is producing positive results. This could involve showcasing early hires or demonstrating quick product advancements from the new SF team.

20. **Incorporate Startup Rituals into SF Operations**: Introduce SF-style rituals (e.g., all-hands meetings, hackathons, demo days) that appeal to engineers looking for a startup feel. These rituals can gradually shift the company culture toward something that aligns with the CEO’s vision.

21. **Offer Flexible Work Packages for Relocating Engineers**: If you’re recruiting global talent to SF, offer flexibility (e.g., temporary remote work) before requiring full-time presence in SF. This helps attract talent that might be hesitant about a permanent move.

22. **Leverage Existing Employees as Recruiters**: Encourage global employees who are passionate about the company’s mission to become recruiters themselves. Their enthusiasm (if genuine) can attract top SF talent, even with the cultural shift underway.

23. **Create a Dual Office Identity**: Market the SF office as the fast-paced innovation hub and the global offices as the “operational backbone.” This allows for different cultural expectations and roles to develop, while keeping the SF office aligned with the CEO’s vision.

24. **CEO-Led Recruiting**: The CEO, as a cofounder, can play a direct role in recruiting top SF talent, conveying the company’s future vision and emphasizing the personal stakes involved in the transformation.

By focusing on these ideas, you can thread the needle between the CEO’s vision of a SF-style startup and the practical concerns of transforming a global organization. This approach would allow the company to attract and grow the right kind of talent while gradually navigating the cultural shift needed for this transformation.

What is an EIR role? How are they structured?

### Assistant - 2024-09-09 21:02:56



### Assistant - 2024-09-09 21:02:56

An **Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR)** is typically a temporary position within a company, venture capital firm, or incubator, where an experienced entrepreneur is brought on board to work on specific projects or help identify new business opportunities. The role is often designed to give the entrepreneur the resources, time, and network to explore new ideas while providing value to the company or firm in the process. The structure of an EIR role can vary, but here’s an outline of how they are typically structured:

### Key Characteristics of an EIR Role:
1. **Temporary or Project-Based**: EIR positions are usually not permanent roles. They often last for a defined period (6-12 months), or they may be tied to the completion of a specific project or milestone.
  
2. **Entrepreneurial Focus**: The role is designed for individuals who have a strong entrepreneurial background, typically someone who has founded, scaled, or sold a company. The focus is often on identifying and executing new business opportunities.

3. **Flexibility**: EIRs are given the flexibility to explore new ideas or initiatives within a loose framework provided by the company or firm. They might focus on building new products, identifying acquisition opportunities, or even incubating their own startup ideas.

4. **Access to Resources**: EIRs are given access to the company's or firm's resources, such as funding, technical infrastructure, market data, and executive support, which helps them pursue innovative ideas more effectively.

5. **Advisory Role**: While the EIR is typically focused on pursuing their own initiatives, they often take on an advisory role within the company. This could involve mentoring teams, helping with product strategy, or offering insights into market trends.

6. **Pathway to Leadership or New Ventures**: At the end of the EIR role, the entrepreneur may have the opportunity to move into a full-time leadership position within the company or spin off a new venture based on the work they developed during the residency.

### Typical Structures of an EIR Role:
- **Within Venture Capital Firms**: 
   - The EIR is often tasked with exploring new investment opportunities, starting their own company, or helping portfolio companies scale.
   - The firm might sponsor or co-invest in the company that the EIR eventually starts.
   - The EIR may advise other startups in the VC’s portfolio.

- **Within Large Companies/Corporates**:
   - The EIR might focus on innovation and growth initiatives that the company doesn’t currently have the bandwidth to explore.
   - The role might involve prototyping new products, leading new business units, or identifying potential acquisitions.
   - EIRs within companies are often tasked with bringing an entrepreneurial mindset to more bureaucratic environments.

- **Within Incubators/Accelerators**:
   - EIRs in these environments often work closely with startups in the program, mentoring founders, helping refine business models, or even co-founding new ventures with other participants.

### Benefits for the Company:
- **New Business Opportunities**: The EIR can bring fresh perspectives, identify new market opportunities, or launch new initiatives that drive growth.
- **Talent and Network**: EIRs usually have strong networks and the ability to attract other top talent, potentially leading to new hires or partnerships.
- **Entrepreneurial Energy**: EIRs bring entrepreneurial drive and innovation to larger companies that may have become more risk-averse or slower to act.

### Benefits for the EIR:
- **Time and Resources**: The EIR gains access to resources, financial backing, and time to develop their ideas without the immediate pressure of running a startup.
- **Networking and Mentorship**: The role can provide valuable exposure to mentors, investors, or future co-founders, helping the EIR expand their network and expertise.
- **Transition Role**: For experienced entrepreneurs, the EIR role can serve as a bridge between ventures or a way to explore new business ideas without committing to a full-time startup from the outset.

### Example:
If an EIR role were implemented at your company, an experienced entrepreneur in the AI or software engineering space could be brought in to:
- Lead exploratory projects in AI coding assistants.
- Identify potential new products or markets.
- Advise on growth and strategy for the SF office or the engineering org as a whole.
- Help incubate internal projects that could be spun off into separate products or divisions.

This role provides an infusion of entrepreneurial energy and expertise while giving the entrepreneur the freedom to explore ideas with the company's backing.
