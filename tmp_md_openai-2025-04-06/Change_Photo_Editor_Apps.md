I encountered some challenges accessing specific resources that could provide detailed instructions for changing the photo editor apps for different profiles on an Amazon Kids tablet. However, based on general knowledge about Amazon Kids tablets, you can typically customize each child's profile by managing the apps and content accessible to them.

Here are the general steps you might follow:

1. Open the Amazon Kids (formerly FreeTime) app on the tablet.
2. Select the child profile you want to manage.
3. Enter your parental control password if prompted.
4. Navigate to the settings or content management section for the profile.
5. From here, you should be able to add or remove apps, including photo editor apps, for the selected profile.

Remember that these steps might vary slightly based on your tablet model and the software version it's running. If you continue to have difficulty, I recommend checking the Amazon Customer Service website or contacting their support for more tailored assistance.

Why do I appear to have two different default versions of the photo app?

### Assistant - 2023-12-13 21:26:50

If you're noticing two different default versions of the photo app on your Amazon Kids tablet, particularly across different child profiles, there could be several reasons for this:

1. **Different Profile Settings**: Each profile on the tablet can have its own set of apps and settings. If the profiles are set up with different permissions or access to content, this might result in different versions or settings for the same app appearing in each profile.

2. **App Updates**: One profile might have an updated version of the photo app, while the other might still be running an older version. This can happen if app updates are not set to occur automatically or if one profile has been used more recently than the other.

3. **Amazon Kids Settings**: The Amazon Kids environment often has a tailored version of apps that are more suitable for children. If one profile is under the Amazon Kids environment and the other is not, they might show different versions of the same app.

4. **Different App Installations**: It's possible that there are two different photo editing apps installed on the device, and each profile is set to use a different one as the default.

5. **Software Glitch**: Sometimes, inconsistencies in app versions can be due to software glitches or errors during app installation or updates.

To resolve this, you might want to check the app settings in each profile, ensure that both profiles have the latest app updates, and review the parental control settings to ensure consistency across profiles. If the issue persists, restarting the tablet or reinstalling the photo app might also help. If none of these solutions work, contacting Amazon's customer support for more specific guidance would be a good next step.
