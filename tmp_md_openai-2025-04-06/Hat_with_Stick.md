It sounds like you might be describing a **hat with a pin** or **hair stick with a cover**. Here are a few possible things that fit your description:  

1. **Bonnet with a hatpin** – A traditional head covering, often secured with a pin.
2. **Hair stick with a decorative cover** – A hairstyling tool used to secure buns or updos.
3. **Umbrella hat** – A hat with a canopy attached, sometimes collapsible.
4. **Veil with a holding stick** – Used in certain cultural or bridal wear.
5. **Wig with a stick for support** – Some wigs are styled or stored on stands that involve a rod or stick.

Could you clarify if it’s a specific cultural or functional item you’re thinking of?

It might be called a hair slide

Yes! A **hair slide** (also called a **barrette** in some regions) is a hair accessory used to hold hair in place. It typically consists of a **decorative cover** and a **stick or clasp** that secures the hair. Some common types include:

- **French Hair Slides** – Metal or plastic clips that snap or clasp shut.
- **Tortoiseshell or Wooden Hair Slides** – Often paired with a stick that threads through openings to hold hair in place.
- **Celtic or Bohemian-style Hair Slides** – Ornate designs with a stick that secures hair in a bun or twist.

Would you like recommendations on styles or how to use them effectively?
