As a leader, it is part of the job to make sure that people meet performance expectations. When somebody is not meeting performance expectations consistently and has been given feedback about it, but has been resistant to the feedback, to the point of denying that there is any problem at all, what can a leader do to more effectively get the person to perform?

Dealing with an employee who is resistant to feedback and consistently fails to meet performance expectations can be challenging. Here are some strategies a leader can employ to address the situation more effectively:

1. **Document Performance Issues:**
   - Keep a detailed record of the specific performance issues, including dates, examples, and any previous feedback given. This helps provide concrete evidence during discussions.

2. **Clarify Expectations:**
   - Ensure that performance expectations are clear, specific, and measurable. Sometimes, misunderstandings about expectations can lead to performance issues.

3. **Seek to Understand:**
   - Have a private, empathetic conversation with the employee to understand their perspective. There may be underlying issues (personal, professional, or otherwise) affecting their performance.

4. **Provide Constructive Feedback:**
   - Focus on specific behaviors and outcomes rather than personal attributes. Use the "SBI" (Situation-Behavior-Impact) model to provide clear, objective feedback.

5. **Set Clear Consequences:**
   - Explain the consequences of continued poor performance, including potential disciplinary actions. Be firm but fair in communicating that improvement is necessary.

6. **Develop an Action Plan:**
   - Collaborate with the employee to create a performance improvement plan (PIP) with specific, achievable goals and timelines. Provide support and resources to help them succeed.

7. **Offer Training and Support:**
   - Determine if additional training or support could help the employee improve. This might include coaching, mentoring, or skill development opportunities.

8. **Regular Check-Ins:**
   - Schedule regular follow-up meetings to monitor progress, provide ongoing feedback, and adjust the action plan as needed.

9. **Involve HR:**
   - If the employee continues to resist feedback and fails to improve, involve Human Resources for additional support and to ensure that all actions comply with company policies and legal requirements.

10. **Be Prepared to Make Tough Decisions:**
    - If all efforts fail and the employee's performance does not improve, be prepared to make difficult decisions, which may include reassignment or termination. It's crucial to prioritize the overall health and productivity of the team.

By following these steps, a leader can create a structured and supportive environment that encourages improvement while also being prepared to take necessary actions if improvement is not achieved.
