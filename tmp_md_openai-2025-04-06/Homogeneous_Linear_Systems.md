What's a homogeneous system of linear equations?

A homogeneous system of linear equations is a system in which all of the constant terms are equal to zero. This means that all the equations in the system have the form:

    a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ... + an*xn = 0

where `a1, a2, ..., an` are the coefficients of the variables, and `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the variables. 

Because all of the equations are equal to zero, a homogeneous system always has at least one solution: the trivial solution, where all variables are equal to zero (`x1 = x2 = ... = xn = 0`). This is always a solution, because no matter what the coefficients are, zero times any number is always zero.

However, a homogeneous system may also have nontrivial solutions, where at least one of the variables is not equal to zero. Whether or not nontrivial solutions exist depends on the coefficients of the equations and their relationships to each other. 

To find the solutions of a homogeneous system, you can use methods such as Gaussian elimination, matrix methods, or substitution, among others.
