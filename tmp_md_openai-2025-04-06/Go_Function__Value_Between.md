Output go code to test if a value is between two other values

### Assistant - 2023-03-21 13:34:58

Here's some sample Go code to test if a value is between two other values:

```
func isBetween(val, lower, upper int) bool {
    return val >= lower && val <= upper
}
```

This function takes three integer parameters - `val`, `lower`, and `upper` - and returns a boolean value indicating whether `val` is between `lower` and `upper` (inclusive).

You can call this function with your own values like this:

```
fmt.Println(isBetween(5, 1, 10)) // Output: true
fmt.Println(isBetween(15, 1, 10)) // Output: false
``` 

In the first call, `isBetween` returns `true` because `5` is between `1` and `10`. In the second call, `isBetween` returns `false` because `15` is not between `1` and `10`.

	- Location constraints: I can do almost anywhere in North America, LatAm, and Europe. The biggest exception is Ireland. Need visas for large chunks of the other continents.

	- Location constraints: I have a South African passport, so need sufficient notice for visa. I currently have a Schengen visa (for europe) and will be getting a UK one for June. US visa application is significantly backlogged so I can't go there or transit through US.  
	- Time constraints: 22 may. June I intend on being on holiday in the UK, but can adjust plans easily.

write go code which takes a start and end date and returns false if the range is less than 6 days

### Assistant - 2023-03-21 14:09:34

Here's some Go code that takes a start date and an end date, and returns false if the difference between the two dates is less than 6 days:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    start := time.Date(2023, time.April, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
    end := time.Date(2023, time.April, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)

    if end.Sub(start).Hours()/24 < 6 {
        fmt.Println("False")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("True")
    }
}
```

In this example, the start date is April 1, 2023 and the end date is April 5, 2023. The code calculates the difference between the two dates in days using the `Sub` method and then divides it by 24 to get the number of hours, and then checks if it's less than 6. If the range is less than 6 days, it returns false.
