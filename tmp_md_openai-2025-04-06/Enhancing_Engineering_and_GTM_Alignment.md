Edit this to increase clarity while keeping the friendly and understanding tone: Thanks. This is super useful. Improving alignment between eng and GTM is a goal that I have for this year. A couple of specific efforts in this space are making sure GTM requests are part of the GTM planning process and working with GTM to define the enterprise readiness bar for different parts of our products and for each area either decide to invest or find a way to deemphasize or deprecate where we're not willing to invest. Of course, we need to actually do that well. For engineering and product/leadership alignment, that's another area where we need to keep coming up ways to improve things, with PFP planning as a first step. However, I'd love for everyone to escalate areas where we're delaying or changing decisions in a way that's harmful so we can make those better.

Thank you for sharing this. Your focus on enhancing the synergy between engineering and GTM (Go-To-Market) is a commendable goal for the year. To specifically address this, two key initiatives stand out: firstly, ensuring that GTM requirements are integrated into the GTM planning process, and secondly, collaborating with the GTM team to establish clear standards for enterprise readiness across different aspects of our products. For each segment, we should either commit to further investment or consider reducing emphasis or phasing out areas where investment is not feasible.

Effectively implementing these strategies is vital. In terms of aligning engineering with product and leadership, continuous improvement is essential. Initiating PFP (Product, Feature, Project) planning is a positive first step. However, itâ€™s equally important to encourage everyone to proactively highlight instances where delays or changes in decisions are proving detrimental. This way, we can identify and address these issues more effectively.
