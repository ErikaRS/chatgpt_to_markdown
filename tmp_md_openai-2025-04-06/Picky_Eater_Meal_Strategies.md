Dealing with a picky eater who grazes throughout the day can be challenging. Here are some strategies you can try:

1. **Establish Routine**: Have set times for meals and snacks. This can help regulate her appetite and make her more likely to eat at mealtimes.

2. **Healthy Options**: Keep healthy snacks available. If she's grazing, it's better that she eats fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other nutritious foods.

3. **Involve Her in Meal Prep**: Kids are often more interested in eating food they've helped prepare. Let her choose some of the ingredients or help with simple tasks in the kitchen.

4. **Make Food Fun**: Present food in an appealing way. You can cut fruits and vegetables into fun shapes or arrange them in an attractive pattern on the plate.

5. **Limit Distractions**: Turn off the TV and put away electronic devices during meals so she can focus on eating.

6. **Be Patient and Positive**: Don't force her to eat. Encourage her to try new foods but donâ€™t make a big deal if she doesn't eat much at a meal.

7. **Set an Example**: Eat a variety of healthy foods yourself. Children often mimic the eating habits of their parents.

Remember, it's normal for children to go through phases of picky eating. If you're concerned about her nutrition, it may be worth discussing with a pediatrician or a dietitian. They can provide personalized advice based on her specific needs.
