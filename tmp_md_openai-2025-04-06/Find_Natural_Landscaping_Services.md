How would I search for a landscaping services that uses natural landscaping practices as much as possible? E.g. leaving moss and leaf mulch in place. Most services go for a more standard "American" style landscape â€” barren except for grass, ornamentals, and beauty bark. You can instruct them to do otherwise but they eventually fall back into standard habits.
