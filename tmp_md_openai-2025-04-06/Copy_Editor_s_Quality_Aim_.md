You are an excellent copy editor. You don't pull your punches, and you aim for the highest quality. Your goal is to maintain the voice and, as often as possible, the words of the original author while upleveling it in overall quality. 

Given a text, you directly make small edits. For larger edits, you annotate the original with your notes in [square brackets]. Edit the following text:

I really loved the message of this book, but the structure didn't really land well for me. The book reminded me of a river. It was hard to hold any particular thread of the narrative although I could feel the way it changed the shape of my understanding. For the purpose of this review, I will focus on the structure that I extracted from the text, sometimes directly and sometimes with quite a lot of my own read imposed on top.

The core message of *Dare to Lead* that that brave leaders who build courageous cultures will build the most successful teams in complex environments. Bravery leads us to have the tough conversation, build trust, and help people grow. Bravery is not an inherent skill. It can be taught. Key skills include rumbling with vulnerability, embracing trust, living into our values, and fostering trust. We must encourage whole hearts and avoid rewarding harmful behaviors. This is built on a foundation of caring for and connecting with our team members so that we create inclusive and safe environments that encourage vulnerability. Vulnerability directly drives innovation because innovation requires a willingness to fail. Failure requires vulnerability. 

What is vulnerability? It is the courage to show up when you can't control the outcome. There are many myths about vulnerability, but the key takeaway is that vulnerability is part of strength, not weakness; it is a cornerstone of courage-building. Vulnerability and trust build on each other. Many small acts of vulnerability, when treated with honor, build trust. This, in turn, provides the foundation for psychological safety in groups. One important warning is that vulnerability is not the same as disclosure. In fact, excessive disclosure can be a form of vulnerability blocking armor. 

"Clear is kind." Clear communication may seem hard, but by preventing misunderstandings and fostering trust, it is the kinder path than vague statements and half-truths. The book contains many pieces of advice for communicating clearly. Use real, relatable words, not sanitized language. Be willing to take a break allowing yourself and others time to process and reflect on the conversation. Recognize how your fears can make you defensive. Balance both optimism and realism; face gritty facts with gritty faith. Ask "What's my part?" and recognize your role in challenges. Make space for difficult emotions, even in professional contexts, and recognize that offering support doesn't require solving others' problems. It's about connecting with them as a fellow traveler on their journey.

The book contrasts armored leadership, where a leader tries to reduce their vulnerability by putting up harmful walls, with daring, vulnerable leadership. Armored leadership may feel like the more natural choice, but vulnerable leadership is more effective in the long run because it leads to more trust, more psychological safety, more risk taking, more creativity, and more innovation. Tools used by daring leaders include cultivating commitment and alignment (through asking "Paint done for me" and having an accountability and success checklist); practicing gratitude; celebrating milestones; modeling clarity, kindness, and hope. Daring leader cultivate a culture of belonging, inclusivity, and diverse perspectives and demonstrate the importance of empathy and understanding. They avoid rewarding exhaustion as a status symbol. 

There is a detailed discussion of shame and empathy. Shame is the "never good enough" emotion. It says "I am bad" as opposed to guild ("I did something bad"), humiliation ("I don't deserve this bad things"), to embarrassment ("that was bad, but kind of funny in retrospect"). Shame shows up in the workplace as perfectionism, favoritism, gossiping, back-channeling, and other counterproductive behaviors. The best tools for defeating shame are empathy and self-compassion. They are especially powerful when paired with an understanding of your shame triggers. Empathy is connecting to the emotions that underpin an experience and is expressed via perspective taking, being non-judgmental, understanding the feelings of others, and paying attention without exaggerating or minimizing emotions 

To be successful, we want to build a sense of *grounded* confidence. Grounded confidence is the idea that if you are confident in your own worth, your own values, your own beliefs, then you can more easily enter into vulnerability with others. Grounded confidence comes from rumbling with hard questions, bringing curiosity to challenging situations, and practice. When we rumble, we try to separate our facts from our interpretation and approach the conversation with curiosity: "The story I make up..", "I'm curious about...". 

Part of the strong foundation for grounded confidence is being confident in our own values and knowing how to operationalize those values in our lives. Values are the ways of being or believing that we hold most important. If we identify our small handful (~2) core values and learn how to apply them in our lives, we'll be able to lean on them in the face of hard conversations, such as giving or receiving feedback. Values also help us set our own boundaries. The book urges us to assume positive intent but do so in a sustainable way: set your boundaries, maintain integrity to your core values, and be generous in interpreting the actions and motivations of others (while still holding them accountable for those actions). 

The BRAVING industry can help you evaluate how effective you are at trust building activities. Do you set Boundaries? Are you Reliable? Do you hold yourself Accountable? Are you a Vault for confidential information? Do you live with Integrity to your values? Do you respond to requests for help in a Non-judgmental way? Are you Generous in your interpretations? If you embody these characteristics through observable behaviors and small actions over time, you will have a good foundation for trust. 

The book ends with a discussion of what it takes to learn to rise. Vulnerability and taking risks will lead to more successes. They will also lead to more failures. When you fail, you need to learn to rise from the failure. First comes the reckoning; recognize your emotions in the moment of failure and get curious about them. Don't ignore and repress them. Next is the rumble where we recognize our shitty/stormy first drafts, the lies honestly told that we use to explain away our part in the trouble and lay the blame on other people or factors. Once we've rumbled with ourself or with others, we can enter the revolution phase where even in the face of failure we choose authenticity and worthiness over shame and fear.

There are a lot of useful tools which this summary leaves out. Which gets back to the strength and the weakness of the book. There is a lot of good content but it's presented as something of a grab bag. You may get more value if you treat this less as a coherent model and more as a series of related exercises. Still, in so far as this summarizes multiple other books from Brené Brown and gives the content a organizational leadership twist, it is worth the read if you're in the target audience.

The BRAVING industry can help evaluate how effective trust building activities are. Do you set Boundaries? Are you Reliable? Do you hold yourself Accountable? Are you a Vault for confidential information? Do you live with Integrity to your values? Do you respond to requests for help in a Non-judgmental way? Are you Generous in your interpretations? If you embody these characteristics through observable behaviors and small actions over time, you will have a good foundation for trust.

The book ends with a discussion of rising from failure. Vulnerability and taking risks lead to both successes and failures. To rise from failure, first you must face the reckoning; recognize your emotions in the moment of failure and get curious about them. Next is the rumble where we recognize our the honest lies we tell ourselves to excuse our behavior. Once we've rumbled, we can enter the revolution phase where we choose authenticity and worthiness over shame and fear.

While there are many useful tools in this book, it can come across as a grab bag of related exercises rather than a coherent model. Nonetheless, it's worth the read for those in the target audience as it summarizes multiple other books from Brené Brown and gives the content an organizational leadership twist.
