Flux essays, as featured in the **FLUX Review**, are thought-provoking pieces that explore complex topics through systems thinking, organizational theory, and interdisciplinary lenses. They dive into themes like organizational change, adaptation, and the nature of flux—ongoing transformation in the business, social, and environmental spheres.

These essays often draw from a variety of fields, including complexity science, cybernetics, and the humanities, to frame problems in novel ways. Their goal is to provoke reflection on how individuals and organizations can better navigate uncertainty, interdependence, and rapid change.

The core essence of **flux essays** is their emphasis on understanding and thriving in dynamic, interconnected environments, with a focus on adaptability, holistic thinking, and resilience. They invite readers to look beyond linear cause-effect reasoning and embrace the more intricate, non-linear processes that govern modern systems.

Draft up a Flux essay: writing that has a richer world behind it than explicitly shown (e g . Tolkien and bluey) is higher quality because it has a conference and sense of cause she effect and meaning that others lack. Use this as a metaphor for how coherent our actions and beliefs are richer and more coherent if there is a "world" behind it we are not showing.

### The Unseen World: Why Depth Matters in Writing—and in Life

In the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien or even children’s shows like *Bluey*, there’s a remarkable quality that often goes unnoticed by casual readers or viewers. Both creators offer stories with a richness that feels infinitely more expansive than what’s on the surface. Tolkien’s Middle-earth, with its vast histories, languages, and cultures, seems to stretch out far beyond the pages of *The Lord of the Rings*. Similarly, *Bluey* is not just a simple show about a family of anthropomorphic dogs—its emotional depth, social dynamics, and unsaid truths create a layered world that resonates with both children and adults. 

This "rich world behind the story" is what sets these works apart. It’s what gives them coherence, a sense of cause and effect, a feeling of gravity and meaning. There is a structure and logic beneath the surface, even if it's not always explicitly presented. 

But what if we think of this idea as more than just a hallmark of great storytelling? What if we extend this metaphor to the way we live and the coherence of our own actions and beliefs?

#### The Visible vs. the Invisible

Just as a great novel or show has a world behind it that lends depth, our actions and beliefs, when they are supported by a deeper set of values and experiences, carry a similar weight. We often judge people or ourselves based on what’s visible: the things we say, the actions we take, or the decisions we make. Yet, the richness comes from what’s unseen—our internal worldview, the "mythology" of our lives, and the coherence of our beliefs.

In systems thinking, this idea is not far from the concept of **root causes** or **mental models**. The actions we take (the visible surface) are often driven by mental frameworks that are deeply held but unexpressed (the world behind the action). These underlying structures give our actions coherence over time. When these deeper layers align with our behavior, the result is a sense of meaning and consistency in our lives, just as an unseen world gives a story its meaning and depth.

#### Building a Coherent World for Yourself

Imagine for a moment that your life’s actions are like the visible chapters of a book, but the real story lies in the notes, drafts, and appendices you never show. When we act without a deeper sense of alignment, our lives can feel fragmented, disjointed—like a series of disconnected events. But when we cultivate an internal world rich with values, beliefs, and purpose, our actions gain coherence and meaning.

In Tolkien’s work, there’s a history behind every object, a backstory for every character, and a deeper cultural context for every conflict. Similarly, the decisions we make today might seem like small choices, but when they’re informed by a larger vision or philosophy of life, they resonate on a deeper level. The way we approach a conflict, choose a career, or treat others can all be reflections of a more extensive internal narrative.

#### The Consequence of a Shallow World

On the flip side, when we act without an internal "world" behind our choices—when our actions are purely reactive or unanchored—we lose that richness. Our choices may appear random, lacking in purpose, much like a story that jumps from event to event without any connective tissue. We become like characters in a shallow novel, whose actions seem arbitrary, without deeper meaning or consequence.

This is particularly evident in organizations that fail to articulate a clear mission or set of values. Actions become disjointed, policies seem random, and long-term coherence is lost. Just as a poorly built fictional world leaves a story hollow, an organization or individual without an underlying belief system feels similarly shallow.

#### Cultivating Your World

So how do we build this unseen world behind our actions? It starts with self-reflection, understanding the beliefs, values, and experiences that shape who we are and why we make the choices we do. This isn’t about creating a rigid set of rules, but rather about cultivating an evolving, adaptive internal landscape that can guide us through the complexities of life.

Like Tolkien’s deep lore, our inner world doesn’t have to be fully visible to others for it to be effective. It’s not about broadcasting every belief or explaining every motivation; it’s about having that sense of depth within ourselves, so that when we act, our choices carry the weight of something larger than the moment. There is a cause and effect, a meaning behind even the smallest decision.

#### Conclusion: Living with Coherence

In great stories, the richness often lies in the world behind the scenes. And so it is in life. When our actions are supported by a deeper coherence, an unseen structure of beliefs and experiences, they carry a sense of meaning that resonates beyond the immediate. We may not always be aware of it, but others can feel it. Like a well-built fictional world, our lives become richer, fuller, and more meaningful when they are grounded in a deep internal landscape.

In the end, living with this internal coherence allows us to not only navigate the complexities of life more effectively but to do so with a sense of purpose, alignment, and richness that others—consciously or unconsciously—can recognize and respect.
