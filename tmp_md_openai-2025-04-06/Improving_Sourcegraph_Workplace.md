This is a personal message I'll be sending to ever person in our engineering, product, and design org. Please give feedback on it.

(Non-urgent, optional)
What is one thing that would make you feel more enthusiastic recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work?

Context:
The trends in our Lattice anonymous pulse surveys show that EPD is not feeling very enthusiastic about Sourcegraph these days. In particular, our sentiment is trending quite negative on the question:
How likely are you to recommend Sourcegraph as a place to work?

I want us to be a place where people want to work, so I am asking everyone the question above. It doesn't matter (and I don't need to know) what you would answer on the sentiment survey question. Rather, wherever you are, I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work. 

I can't say what I can do with the responses until I know the content, but I will read every response and put together a plan. 

Answering is completely optional. Or, if you'd like, you can give more than one thing. I'll take that too. 

Thank you so much!

Hi Team,

**What is one thing that would make you feel more enthusiastic about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work?**

**Context:**
