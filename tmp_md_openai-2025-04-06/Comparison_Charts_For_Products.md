what are those tables called where you rate products on multiple dimensions

Those tables are commonly referred to as "comparison charts" or "feature comparison tables." They allow you to evaluate and compare multiple products based on various attributes or features side-by-side. This type of table is especially useful in product reviews, buyerâ€™s guides, and when making purchasing decisions, as it visually breaks down the differences and similarities between products across multiple dimensions, such as price, quality, performance, and specific features relevant to the products being compared.

What about the ones for getting feedback?

For gathering feedback, the tables you're thinking of are often called "rating scales" or "feedback forms" that include "Likert scales." Likert scales are particularly popular in surveys and feedback forms for evaluating attitudes, opinions, or perceptions across several dimensions. They typically ask respondents to rate their level of agreement, satisfaction, or frequency on a scale, usually ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" or from "very satisfied" to "very unsatisfied."

These scales can be part of a larger feedback form or survey and are used to quantitatively measure people's attitudes, opinions, or perceptions about products, services, experiences, or hypotheses. The data collected from these scales can then be analyzed to understand general sentiments, preferences, or feedback trends.
