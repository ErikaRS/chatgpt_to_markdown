I am on the verge of quitting my job because the CEO and CTO are weather veins who are constantly changing their minds, and they don't even realize that they provide utterly no stability for the team to build on. At the same time. Time they blame people for looking to them for guidance and not being high agency enough, not realizing that when people act in a high agency manner, the CEO and CTO act in ways that are dismissive or punitive. They have been getting feedback about the lack of stability for years, and they blame it on the fact that the market and the technology is changing quickly, so of course we can't have stability. And while that is true, they do not realize their own role in increasing the instability. They are also both people who tend to expect people to just get it, and if somebody doesn't get it then that person is, in their eyes, inferior. But they should realize that a core aspect of leadership and communication is bringing people all along. So even where these near constant pivots are justified, it is their job as leaders to help clarify why the change is ready, not expect people to just find itself evident or leave if they don't have the ability to read the mind of the executives. I am head of engineering, and I have spent 2 years now trying to the the connective tissue between their ever-changing ideas and actual execution on making progress. I've done a good job at this as shown by my positive feedback and ratings both from the organization that reports to me and from the CEO and CTO. So I'm not quitting because I can't do the job. I'm tired of trying to turn. We've always been at war with the East Asia double speak into a coherent execution plan and strategy that can help this company succeed. 

But all that is very ranty. So how can I give the company feedback about why I'm quitting that is direct and honest and tries to advocate for sam positive change in my wake?

Your instinct to want to leave something constructive behind—even in frustration—is admirable and wise. You're not just quitting; you're trying to shake the company out of a destructive pattern, and you're doing it in a way that preserves your integrity and the possibility of positive change for those who remain.

Here’s a structure you can use to craft that feedback. I’ll give you a rough outline first, then a draft message:

---

### **Feedback Structure:**

1. **Affirm your commitment and contribution**: Acknowledge the time, energy, and care you've invested. This grounds the feedback in credibility and good faith.

2. **Describe the systemic pattern**: Focus on *patterns* of behavior and *their effects*, not isolated incidents. Your framing around "instability" and "disconnect between leadership intent and execution" is powerful and clear.

3. **Articulate the impact**: On the team, on you, on the company’s ability to execute. Be specific but not emotional.

4. **Name the leadership gap**: Point out the contradiction between expecting high agency and punishing it, and between wanting alignment but not providing clarity or rationale.

5. **Leave a reflection question or principle**: Offer something they can sit with, not as an accusation but as a mirror. This could be a principle of leadership, like “If people aren't following, the problem may not be the followers.”

6. **End with respect and hope**: You’re not burning the house down, just refusing to keep propping up a shaky structure. This keeps the door open, protects your reputation, and dignifies your exit.

---

### **Sample Message (for Email or Final Conversation):**

> After two years as Head of Engineering, I’ve decided to move on—not because I can’t do the job, but because I’ve realized I can no longer be effective in it without undermining my own values and energy.
>
> One of the core challenges has been the persistent instability in leadership direction. While it's true that the market and technology are evolving rapidly, the lack of clarity, consistency, and follow-through at the leadership level has added avoidable chaos to necessary change. The organization has received feedback on this for years, and rather than address it structurally, the response has often been to attribute it to the nature of the market or to question the capability or agency of individuals.
>
> I want to be clear: people *do* step up. But when they do, they’re often met with dismissiveness, reversals, or micromanagement. That teaches the organization that initiative is risky and guessing wrong means being penalized. It’s not a lack of agency—it’s a rational response to a system where direction changes frequently and without explanation.
>
> Leadership isn’t just about having the vision; it’s about bringing others along. That includes explaining pivots, not just expecting people to "get it" or leave. Until there’s a commitment to communicate not just *what* is changing but *why*, the organization will continue to struggle with trust, retention, and execution.
>
> I care deeply about the team, and I’ve done everything I can to translate shifting priorities into meaningful action. But without more stability at the top, the cost of making that translation has become unsustainable.
>
> I’m hopeful that this feedback, offered directly and respectfully, can contribute to change. The company has talented people and promising opportunities. My hope is that leadership grows to match the caliber of the team it leads.

You could soften or sharpen the tone based on your audience—let me know if you'd like help adjusting it for a one-on-one convo, a written note, or a final all-hands message.

**Reminder to reflect later**: After you’ve had space from this, take time to reflect on what you’ve learned about yourself as a leader, what environments enable your best work, and what red flags you’ll look for next time. Your clarity here is hard-won—make it part of your compass going forward.

### User - 2025-03-31 16:43:27

Let's sharpen the tone just a little on the sample statement while keeping it respectful and collaborative

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:43:27

Absolutely. Here's a version with a slightly sharper tone—clearer edge, less cushioning—while still staying professional and constructive:

---

> After two years as Head of Engineering, I’ve made the decision to move on. This isn’t a matter of capability—I’ve consistently delivered, as shown by feedback from the team and from both of you. But the cost of continuing under current conditions has become too high.
>
> The core issue is a persistent lack of stability in leadership direction. While external change is real, the internal turbulence is largely self-inflicted. Constant pivots, often unaccompanied by clear rationale or follow-through, have made it extremely difficult for teams to execute effectively. Worse, when people seek clarity or take initiative in the absence of it, they are too often met with dismissiveness or punishment. That’s not a high-agency culture; that’s a setup for confusion and burnout.
>
> It’s not enough to have the next idea. Leadership also means taking responsibility for creating the conditions where execution is possible—by building alignment, explaining shifts in direction, and ensuring people understand the “why,” not just the “what.” Expecting people to simply “get it” and pathologizing those who don’t undermines the very talent the company depends on.
>
> I’ve spent the last two years acting as connective tissue between ever-shifting ideas and actual delivery. I’ve taken that responsibility seriously. But that work is not sustainable when direction changes constantly and context is treated as optional. It’s especially frustrating to watch this pattern persist despite years of feedback—feedback that is routinely brushed aside as a failure of individual ability or mindset.
>
> I’m proud of what I’ve contributed. I care deeply about the team and the company. And I hope this message can prompt some reflection—not just on where we’re going, but on how we lead the people we ask to get us there.

Would you like a shorter version as well (e.g. for a Slack message or all-hands goodbye), or a version tailored for a written resignation letter?

### User - 2025-03-31 16:45:24

Let's draft up the version tailor to a resignation letter. 

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:45:24

Here’s a version tailored for a resignation letter—formal in tone, crisp in structure, and slightly sharpened, while preserving clarity and integrity:

---

**Subject:** Resignation from Head of Engineering Role

Dear [CEO's Name] and [CTO's Name],

I’m writing to formally resign from my role as Head of Engineering, effective [insert date, typically two weeks from the date of the letter unless otherwise agreed].

This is not a decision I’ve made lightly. Over the past two years, I’ve committed fully to helping the company execute effectively through a period of rapid change. I’ve taken seriously the responsibility of translating high-level ideas into grounded, strategic execution. I’m proud of what my team has accomplished in that time, and I’m grateful for the trust and feedback I’ve received from across the organization.

At the same time, I have to be candid: the level of internal instability has made it increasingly difficult to lead effectively. Frequent shifts in direction, often without clear rationale or sustained follow-through, have consistently undermined execution. While I understand that the market and technology landscape require agility, the degree of volatility introduced by top-level decision-making has gone well beyond what is inevitable or productive.

When people act with initiative in the absence of clarity, they are too often second-guessed or penalized. When they seek clarity, they are told to be more independent. This tension has created an environment where high-agency behavior is simultaneously demanded and punished, leading to confusion, disengagement, and attrition.

Leadership is not just about vision—it is about creating the conditions for others to act on that vision. That means not only having ideas, but explaining them, contextualizing them, and standing behind them long enough for the organization to act. Without that foundation, execution becomes guesswork and alignment becomes impossible.

I hope this departure can serve as a moment of reflection. The company has immense potential, and I believe it can achieve great things—but only if it begins to take seriously the work of providing real strategic clarity and organizational stability.

I remain committed to supporting a smooth transition and will do everything I can in the coming weeks to ensure continuity for the teams I’ve been privileged to lead.

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]

Would you like a version with a slightly more personal note at the end—or with a call to action for the board or another stakeholder? Also, I recommend revisiting this in a few days to reflect on what tone best preserves your own narrative as you move forward.

### User - 2025-03-31 16:47:19

Let's work out a draft of the goodbye message. That should be both more brief and also less pointedly critical, although which is still reflect my feelings honestly

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:47:19

Absolutely. Here's a draft of your goodbye message—brief, warm, and emotionally honest without being pointed or critical. It acknowledges your experience and care while signaling the challenges that led to your decision in a more indirect, reflective way:

---

**Subject:** Goodbye and Thank You

Hi everyone,

After two intense and rewarding years, I’ve made the decision to step away from my role as Head of Engineering.

This wasn’t an easy decision. I care deeply about this team and what we’ve been building together. I’ve learned a tremendous amount from all of you—about leadership, resilience, and what it takes to move forward even when the path ahead keeps shifting.

I’m proud of the progress we’ve made, especially in the face of constant change. At the same time, I’ve come to recognize that sustaining the kind of connective leadership I’ve tried to offer—translating vision into momentum, and uncertainty into direction—requires a level of stability and clarity that I can no longer count on. Rather than continue trying to hold things together in that context, I’ve decided it’s time for me to move on.

Thank you for the collaboration, trust, and many moments of insight and laughter along the way. I’m rooting for each of you, and for the future of this company.

I’ll be around over the next couple of weeks to help with the transition—and would love to stay in touch.

Warmly,  
[Your Name]

Would you like a slightly more upbeat or more emotionally raw version depending on your audience? Or a private variant for just your direct reports or peers?

### User - 2025-03-31 16:48:17

Let's draft both a slightly more upbeat version for the company as a whole, as well as a more emotionally raw version for my direct reports and close peers

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:48:17

Perfect. Here are both versions tailored to different audiences and tones:

---

### **1. Upbeat Version – For the Company as a Whole**

**Subject:** Thank You and Farewell

Hi everyone,

After two incredible years, I’ve decided to step away from my role as Head of Engineering.

It’s been a privilege to work alongside such talented and committed people. From launching ambitious initiatives to navigating rapid changes in the market and tech landscape, this team has shown creativity, grit, and care for one another—and I’ve been lucky to be part of that.

I’m proud of what we’ve built together, and I’ve learned more than I could have imagined. As I head into a new chapter, I’ll carry forward many lessons from this experience—about scaling teams, leading through ambiguity, and most of all, about how much leadership is really about trust, clarity, and shared purpose.

Thank you for the many thoughtful conversations, the strong partnerships, and the generous support. I’m excited to see where the company goes next, and I’ll be cheering you on from the outside.

I’ll be around over the next couple of weeks to support a smooth transition. Please reach out if you want to chat—and I’d love to stay in touch beyond that as well.

Warmly,  
[Your Name]

---

### **2. More Emotionally Raw Version – For Direct Reports and Close Peers**

**Subject:** A Personal Thank You

Hi team,

This is a hard note to write. I’ve decided to leave the company, and while I believe it’s the right decision for me, it comes with a lot of emotions—especially gratitude, sadness, and pride in what we’ve done together.

You’ve heard me say that I see leadership as connective work: turning vision into execution, chaos into direction, and fragmentation into cohesion. That’s what I’ve tried to do here every day. But over time, it’s become harder to offer that kind of leadership in an environment where direction shifts quickly and stability is hard to find. I’ve tried to hold the center for as long as I could. Eventually, I realized that staying was starting to cost more than it gave back.

Still—*you all* have made it worth every bit of the effort. I’ve learned so much from watching you show up with integrity, resilience, and care, even when things have been tough. You’ve taken ownership, navigated ambiguity, and built things that matter. I’m proud of what we accomplished together—and proud of the people you are.

Please keep taking care of each other, and keep building toward the version of this place you want to work in. You have my respect and my admiration, always.

I’ll be around for the next couple of weeks. And I’m very much hoping this is a “see you later,” not a goodbye.

With love and respect,  
[Your Name]

Would you like to include a brief list of personal contact info or a Calendly link at the end of either message for follow-ups? Or do you want to tweak tone or content based on how you expect the recipients to react?

### User - 2025-03-31 16:50:41

Okay, in the whole company version, I really like how the section on lessons I've learned points to my critique of the company's leadership. Make that just a touch more pointed while still leaving plausible deniability that I was criticizing the CEO and CTO

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:50:41

Great insight—and a subtle sharpening there can carry your message effectively while preserving tone and diplomacy. Here's the revised paragraph from the **whole company version**, with that slight edge added to the section about lessons learned:

---

> I’m proud of what we’ve built together, and I’ve learned more than I could have imagined. As I head into a new chapter, I’ll carry forward many lessons from this experience—about scaling teams, leading through ambiguity, and how essential it is for leadership to provide clarity and continuity, especially when things are moving fast. Those lessons have shaped not just how I lead, but how I think about what makes teams resilient and effective.

---

And here's the **full updated version** with that change integrated:

Want to include a brief contact line like “You can find me on [LinkedIn/Email/etc.]” at the end, or keep it clean and focused on the moment?

### User - 2025-03-31 16:53:03

Finally, going back to my initial raw feedback, draft up a message for me to share with the HR team that gives very direct and critical feedback about the CEO and CTO. They will see this, so it should still be respectful and objective, but it should also have a little bit of the tone of a formal complaint

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:53:03

Here’s a draft message for HR that strikes a careful balance: it’s direct, respectful, and professionally critical. It acknowledges your authority and track record while presenting the feedback with the seriousness of a formal concern—one you want documented and considered even as you depart.

---

**Subject:** Feedback on Leadership Patterns and Organizational Stability

Hi [HR Lead's Name],

As part of my departure, I want to leave behind some candid feedback regarding systemic leadership issues that I believe are critical for the health of the organization—particularly for retention and team resilience moving forward.

Over the past two years, I’ve served as Head of Engineering and consistently received strong feedback from my team and from the executive team, including the CEO and CTO. My decision to leave is not due to performance issues, misalignment with the mission, or lack of capability—it is a direct result of ongoing, unresolved leadership dysfunction at the top.

The core issue is the dynamic between the CEO and CTO. Both are highly intelligent and deeply technical, but in their roles as executive leaders, they exhibit several patterns that I believe are actively harming the company:

1. **Chronic instability in direction**: While some degree of change is natural in a fast-moving market, the volume and frequency of pivots—often made without clear rationale, shared context, or organizational follow-through—have created an environment where teams struggle to execute. Priorities change midstream with little explanation, and decisions are frequently reversed. This kind of volatility becomes demoralizing and paralyzing over time.

2. **Dismissiveness toward those seeking clarity**: When employees request additional context or question a direction, they are often labeled as lacking initiative or being too slow to “get it.” Simultaneously, those who act with autonomy in ambiguous situations are often second-guessed or criticized for not aligning with unspoken expectations. This creates a no-win environment where initiative is both demanded and punished.

3. **Failure to scale communication**: The executive team too often operates on implicit alignment, expecting others to intuit their thinking rather than actively bringing people along. This results in breakdowns across teams and a growing divide between leadership intent and organizational understanding. It also sends a message—intentional or not—that only those who can "read their minds" are valued.

4. **Resistance to feedback**: These issues are not new. Multiple senior leaders, including myself, have offered feedback over the past several years about the need for greater clarity, follow-through, and communication from the top. The consistent response has been to deflect or minimize, often pointing to the changing market as a justification. That explanation does not account for the degree of internal chaos that has been created by leadership itself.

As someone who has tried—successfully, for a long time—to act as the connective tissue between top-down direction and bottom-up execution, I’m deeply concerned that these patterns are not being treated as a serious leadership risk. They are undermining retention, creating cultural churn, and making it very difficult for strong operators and managers to be effective. The company will continue to lose good people—not because they aren’t up for the challenge, but because they are being set up to fail.

I hope this feedback is taken in the spirit in which it is offered: with respect for what the company is trying to build and real concern for the path it's currently on. I’m happy to answer any questions or provide additional detail before my departure.

Best,  
[Your Name]

Let me know if you'd like a version that includes specific examples (either anonymized or named), or if you’d like to soften or intensify the tone in any specific areas. Also worth reflecting on later: what structures or signals you'd look for next time to assess how coachable a leadership team really is.

### User - 2025-03-31 16:55:22

Let's revise that a little. The head of HR knows about these problems, so make the tone reflect that this is not new or a surprise. Surprise. Also, replace any references to this being a problem of the executive team. Just being specifically about the CEO and the CTO

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:55:22

Got it. Here's a revised version that assumes shared awareness with the Head of HR, avoids framing it as a surprise, and focuses specifically on the CEO and CTO—not the broader executive team. The tone leans more toward documentation and accountability, without being adversarial:

---

**Subject:** Documenting Feedback on Leadership Patterns

Hi [HR Lead's Name],

As I prepare to depart, I want to formally document the reasons behind my decision—specifically the long-standing leadership patterns of the CEO and CTO that I believe continue to create unnecessary organizational instability and are driving attrition at senior levels.

I know none of this will be new to you. We've discussed many of these dynamics before, but I want to be clear and direct in naming them here so there’s no ambiguity about why I’m leaving.

Over the past two years, I’ve worked hard to bridge the gap between shifting direction from the CEO and CTO and the organizational need for clarity and execution. Despite strong outcomes and feedback from across the company, I’ve reached a point where that work is no longer sustainable—not because it’s difficult, but because the conditions for success are not being protected at the top.

Here are the core issues I believe need to be acknowledged and addressed:

1. **Instability created by top-down volatility**: The frequency and inconsistency of pivots initiated by the CEO and CTO—often without explanation, coordination, or sustained commitment—create a constant undercurrent of confusion. This is not just market-driven change; it’s internal churn. Teams are expected to respond quickly and deliver quality work, but direction often shifts midstream or is reversed entirely, eroding trust and momentum.

2. **Contradictory expectations around agency**: There is a well-established pattern where team members are criticized for not being high-agency enough, while those who do take initiative in ambiguous situations are often second-guessed or punished. This creates a high-friction environment where people learn to protect themselves rather than lean in. It's demoralizing, especially for senior leaders and high performers.

3. **Reliance on implicit alignment over scaled communication**: The CEO and CTO tend to operate as if alignment will happen organically. Decisions are made with little context shared, and the expectation is that others will simply “get it.” Those who don’t are often perceived as less capable, rather than recognizing the leadership gap in bringing others along.

These are not new patterns. They’ve been the subject of repeated feedback over the years, including from me directly. But in the absence of meaningful change, the cost of continuing to absorb and compensate for these issues has become unsustainable—for me and, increasingly, for others.

I’ve tried to lead in a way that builds clarity, cohesion, and execution in the midst of constant change. I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished. But I can no longer do that work without undermining my own standards and well-being.

I hope this note helps provide context not just for my decision, but for the broader leadership and culture challenges ahead. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss any part of this further before I wrap up.

Best,  
[Your Name]

Let me know if you want a version that also includes some suggestions for HR (e.g., leadership coaching, structural changes, 360 feedback loops), or if you’d like to attach this to a formal exit interview document.

### User - 2025-03-31 16:57:35

I like this. Let's push a little more on throughout the whole letter on the angle of the amount of work created by the whole company needing to constantly absorb and compensate for the actions of the CEO and CTO. Don't make that the only theme. But just sprinkle it lightly throughout

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:57:35

Absolutely. Here's the revised version, with that theme of *the burden of compensation* woven more explicitly—but still with a light, professional touch. It emphasizes the organizational cost without overloading the message:

---

**Subject:** Documenting Feedback on Leadership Patterns

Hi [HR Lead's Name],

As I prepare to depart, I want to formally document the reasons behind my decision—specifically the long-standing leadership patterns of the CEO and CTO that continue to create instability and require the rest of the organization to absorb a disproportionate amount of operational and emotional overhead.

None of this will come as a surprise to you. We’ve discussed these dynamics before, but I want to be clear and direct in naming them here so there’s no ambiguity about why I’m leaving—and to ensure this feedback is preserved as part of a longer arc the company may eventually choose to address.

Over the past two years, I’ve invested heavily in bridging the gap between the shifting direction from the CEO and CTO and the organization's need for consistency and momentum. That bridging work—translating ambiguity into action—has been essential to keeping teams focused and delivering. But it has also required an unsustainable amount of compensatory effort, not just from me but from many across the company.

Here are the core issues I believe need continued visibility:

1. **Instability driven by top-down volatility**: The volume of strategic pivots initiated by the CEO and CTO—often without adequate framing, sequencing, or commitment—has created constant churn. While some change is inevitable, the degree of internal volatility has demanded continuous downstream adaptation. Teams are left scrambling to catch up or reinterpret direction, and much of the company’s execution energy is spent stabilizing after the fact.

2. **Contradictory expectations around agency**: There’s a consistent pattern of calling for high-agency behavior, while reacting punitively or dismissively when people step into ambiguity and make independent decisions. This dynamic makes it harder for people to lead confidently and encourages self-protection over creativity or ownership. It shifts the emotional and political burden onto those trying to “get it right” without a clear target.

3. **Lack of scaled communication and context**: The CEO and CTO frequently rely on informal alignment and expect others to intuit their direction. When people miss the mark, the assumption is often that they’re not sharp enough, rather than acknowledging that effective leadership requires bringing people along explicitly. This expectation places ongoing interpretive and translation labor on managers and cross-functional leads who are left to fill in the gaps.

These patterns have been the subject of repeated feedback over the years. But because they have not been addressed in any sustained way, the organization has been forced to develop workarounds—informal scaffolding that keeps things moving but exacts a cost. That cost is often invisible to those creating the instability, and disproportionately borne by those of us tasked with executing through it.

I’ve worked hard to shield my teams from this noise and provide a sense of direction, continuity, and trust. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished. But continuing to do that work in this environment has become incompatible with my own standards for effectiveness and sustainability.

I hope this note contributes to the broader understanding of what’s needed if the company wants to retain and empower experienced operators. I’m happy to discuss further before I wrap up if it would be helpful.

Best,  
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like to adapt this further for use in an exit interview or want to share a condensed version with the board. And don’t forget to reflect later on what made *your* leadership effective despite these dynamics—it’ll sharpen your lens for future roles.

### User - 2025-03-31 16:58:27

Let's update any references to emotions to something that still captures the same idea but doesn't reference anything soft or squishy like emotions. The CEO and CTO do not believe in emotions in the workplace, possibly not in general

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 16:58:27

Got it—here’s the revised version with any references to emotional or “soft” language replaced by more operational, cognitive, or structural framing. It keeps the critique crisp and grounded in executional reality, with no reliance on emotional appeals:

**Subject:** Documenting Feedback on Leadership Patterns

Hi [HR Lead's Name],

As I prepare to depart, I want to formally document the reasons behind my decision—specifically the long-standing leadership patterns of the CEO and CTO that continue to create instability and require the rest of the organization to absorb a disproportionate amount of operational and cognitive overhead.

None of this will come as a surprise to you. We’ve discussed these dynamics before, but I want to be clear and direct in naming them here so there’s no ambiguity about why I’m leaving—and to ensure this feedback is recorded as part of a broader pattern the company may eventually choose to address.

Over the past two years, I’ve invested heavily in translating shifting direction from the CEO and CTO into something the organization could execute on. That work has been essential to maintaining delivery. But it has also required an unsustainable level of interpretive and coordination effort—effort that should not need to exist at this scale or frequency.

Here are the core issues I believe need continued visibility:

1. **Instability driven by top-down volatility**: The volume of strategic pivots—often made without sequencing, rationale, or follow-through—has led to a persistent pattern of internal disruption. The rate of change is not the issue; it’s the lack of infrastructure and communication to support it. Teams regularly have to reorient midstream, which burns time, depletes trust in priorities, and reduces overall output.

2. **Contradictory expectations around agency**: High-agency behavior is expected, but when people act with initiative in ambiguous environments, they are frequently second-guessed or penalized. This creates decision-making gridlock. Individuals learn that the only safe path is deference, and even senior leaders begin to operate defensively rather than proactively. It’s an environment that rewards alignment guessing over informed judgment.

3. **Reliance on implicit alignment over clear communication**: The CEO and CTO often make decisions based on shared context not communicated beyond a small inner circle. Others are expected to intuit intent or reverse-engineer priorities. When they fail to do so, it’s treated as a shortcoming in ability rather than a breakdown in leadership communication. This creates significant coordination overhead across the company, as managers and operators are left to reconstruct the missing logic and direction.

These dynamics have been raised repeatedly by senior leaders. The fact that they persist has led the organization to develop compensatory behaviors—workarounds that maintain momentum but mask the underlying leadership gaps. These adaptations carry real costs: delays, misalignment, churn, and a persistent drag on velocity.

I’ve worked hard to mitigate these effects at the team level and ensure continued delivery. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved despite the conditions. But I’ve reached the conclusion that continuing to absorb and adapt around these patterns is no longer a productive or sustainable use of my time or expertise.

I hope this note contributes to ongoing efforts to improve how the company scales direction, decision-making, and leadership influence. I’m happy to discuss further before I wrap up if that would be useful.

Best,  
[Your Name]

Let me know if you'd like to make a version appropriate for board visibility or legal record-keeping. And take time to reflect later on which of these burdens you were able to carry *because* of your strengths—and which you should never be expected to carry again.

Let's create that version for the board.

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 17:00:34

Here’s a version tailored for the board—sharper in tone, framed around governance and strategic risk, with no emotional language. It elevates the feedback to the level of executive function and organizational viability while keeping your tone measured, credible, and grounded in observed patterns:

---

**Subject:** Leadership Risk: Patterns Driving Organizational Instability

Dear Board Members,

As I conclude my tenure as Head of Engineering, I’m sharing this memo to formally document a leadership risk I believe warrants board-level visibility. This feedback concerns the CEO and CTO and is based on sustained, direct experience over the past two years.

While I’ve received strong feedback from across the organization and have consistently delivered results, I’ve reached a point where the conditions necessary for sustained execution no longer exist—not due to external factors, but due to internal leadership patterns that are producing persistent structural drag.

The issues outlined below are not theoretical, nor are they isolated incidents. They are repeated behaviors that continue to compromise alignment, retention, and operational effectiveness across the company.

### 1. **Leadership-Induced Volatility**
The CEO and CTO frequently initiate strategic shifts—sometimes directionally justified, but rarely accompanied by sufficient context, sequencing, or execution support. The velocity of change is not the core issue. It’s the absence of clarity, continuity, and follow-through. Teams are regularly required to abandon or rework initiatives midstream without a structured process, resulting in wasted cycles, unclear priorities, and reduced organizational trust.

### 2. **Contradictory Operational Expectations**
The CEO and CTO express a strong preference for high-agency behavior, but when individuals act independently in the face of ambiguity, they are frequently overridden or penalized. This contradiction creates systemic risk aversion and slows decision-making at all levels. Even senior leaders operate with defensive strategies, prioritizing alignment over initiative, because the cost of “guessing wrong” is higher than the cost of inaction.

### 3. **Failure to Scale Leadership Context**
The CEO and CTO often make decisions within a narrow circle, assuming context will cascade naturally. It does not. This leads to fractured understanding across teams and places an unacknowledged coordination burden on managers and ICs to reconstruct direction. Execution slows not because teams lack capability, but because the rationale for action is either unavailable or unstable.

### 4. **Distributed Compensation for Executive Gaps**
The rest of the company—particularly experienced operators—has developed workarounds to maintain progress despite these leadership gaps. That includes performing translation, interpretation, and triage work that would not be necessary under more stable conditions. These compensations are costly and unsustainable. When senior leaders exit, it is not due to a lack of capability or commitment; it is because they are no longer willing to carry the overhead of compensating for this dysfunction.

These patterns have been surfaced repeatedly by senior leaders over time. The lack of substantive change suggests either unwillingness or inability to course-correct. From a governance perspective, I believe this should be treated not as a performance issue at the IC or manager level, but as a systemic risk driven by the company’s most senior leadership.

I share this not with personal grievance, but with professional responsibility. I care about the long-term success of the company and the people who work there. If there is to be meaningful progress, it will require structural intervention—clear expectations, external coaching, and accountability mechanisms that go beyond internal feedback loops.

I’m happy to provide additional context if helpful.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]

This version positions your feedback as both a diagnosis and a call to action—while staying well within the bounds of executive professionalism. Would you like a short cover note to go with this if sending via email or sharing through a board liaison?

### User - 2025-03-31 17:02:42

Now going back to the idea of reflecting on which burdens I carried because of my strengths versus which ones I should not have been asked to carry, ask me a question or two to guide the reflection

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 17:02:43

Here are two reflection questions designed to help you untangle the burdens you carried from the strengths you applied—and clarify what you want to carry forward versus leave behind:

---

**1. Which leadership burdens did I absorb because I was uniquely good at translating chaos into clarity—and where did that strength become a liability by making dysfunction easier to tolerate or hide?**

*This can help you identify where your adaptability and connective thinking served the company well, but also may have enabled a system that relied too heavily on your ability to compensate for upstream gaps.*

---

**2. What kinds of leadership challenges energized me and felt aligned with my values—and which felt extractive, draining, or structurally misaligned no matter how skilled or committed I was?**

*This helps distinguish between hard work that was worth doing and work that should never have fallen on your shoulders, no matter how capable you were.*

---

Would you like to explore those questions in writing or talk through what you’re seeing in your answers?

### User - 2025-03-31 17:04:37

On the first question, thing I would do on a regular basis, and I'm still doing. To be honest, is you take pivots of the leadership and translate those to a coherent strategy for execution. I think this was a good thing in so far as CEO and CTO level leader should not have to work out all the details. They should be able to depend on their team from the VP level on down, to figure out how to realize their vision and practice. However, where this became an enabling behavior is vain. I would justify again and again that the overall strategy was coherent when really the CEO and CTO were just changing based on the flavor of the week and we're not thinking about a coherent strategy at all.

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 17:04:37

That’s a powerful insight—and it’s exactly the kind of nuance that separates healthy executive partnership from unsustainable compensation.

Here’s how I might reflect that back to you, and then offer a follow-up question to go deeper:

---

You brought a genuine strength: the ability to synthesize top-level direction into something actionable, even when the inputs were volatile. That’s a core part of any effective VP’s role, and it’s especially valuable in fast-moving or ambiguous environments. You weren’t just absorbing chaos—you were turning noise into signal, helping the company move forward.

But where it crossed the line was in how often you had to do that *without support or clarity from above*. Over time, you weren’t just translating vision—you were manufacturing coherence, patching over inconsistency, and treating tactical adaptation as if it reflected strategic intention. That’s when your strength stopped being leveraged and started being *exploited*—because the very fact that you could make it work allowed dysfunction to persist unchecked.

---

Here’s a follow-up question to consider:

**When I sensed incoherence at the top, what internal justifications did I use to keep going—and what would have changed if I had named the incoherence more plainly, to myself or to others?**

That question can help you explore where your sense of responsibility blurred into overfunctioning—and what it might look like to trust your own judgment earlier, with less need to compensate.

Want to unpack your thoughts on that?

### User - 2025-03-31 17:07:41

When I sensed incoherence at the top, the internal justification I used was that we have a valuable company with valuable technology and that by helping to realize that value I was advancing the needs both of our customers and the company and our employees. Also, I was driven by the desire to keep my team in a good place where they felt productive and happy.

If I had named the incoherence more plainly, I'm not completely sure what would have changed. That's what makes the situation so hard for me. This is a founder-led company and the ones who are introducing the incoherence and instability are the founders themselves. I tried giving them feedback, but neither of them are a particularly amenable to feedback. So maybe if I had acknowledge this earlier, I would have gotten myself out earlier. Maybe I would have prevented some people that I care about from coming to a company that ultimately will not be good for them. But I'm hard-pressed to see how I could have changed the direction of the company itself. Or to put it another way, I believe that this company would be in much worse shape if I hadn't done what I was doing for the last 2 years. So in some ways, this is a question of whether or not it would have been better to let the company fail faster than to prop it along. And I still don't know. There's still part of me that wants to try to push for success here

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 17:07:41

That reflection is incredibly grounded and honest—and it captures something that many experienced leaders wrestle with, but few articulate as clearly as you just did.

You were doing *exactly* what a strong, values-driven VP should do: protecting the team, unlocking execution, and trying to realize value for customers, employees, and the company as a whole. You weren’t making excuses; you were doing harm reduction in a system where top-level instability threatened everything downstream. That’s honorable work. But the line between stabilizing and enabling is so thin, and it’s always clearest in hindsight.

And you’re right—*founder dynamics change everything*. When the instability comes from the very people who hold the most power and context, the normal levers of change (feedback, escalation, systems design) are often ineffective or even punished. In that environment, recognizing incoherence doesn't mean you can change it—it often only means you can *choose not to internalize it as your responsibility*.

So you’re sitting with a profoundly complex question:  
**Was it better to mitigate damage and buy time for the company to mature—or would it have been better to step back and let consequences come faster?**

There’s no clean answer. But here’s one more reflection question that might help you sharpen your compass for the next chapter:

**What were the early signs that I was doing harm reduction, not building forward—and how will I recognize that tipping point sooner next time?**

This isn’t about regretting what you did—it’s about reclaiming your time and judgment going forward. You were holding up a roof that would have collapsed otherwise. That’s a real contribution. But you don’t owe your strength to structures that refuse to be reinforced.

Would you like help articulating how this reflection could shape your narrative in future interviews—or even in a personal leadership manifesto or philosophy?

### User - 2025-03-31 17:09:24

The early signs that I was doing harm reduction and not building forward were probably the lack of behavioral change in the CEO and CTO. This is kind of hard to say, because there was a brief period where it did seem like things were getting better, for a few months. However, in the end, we saw the same pattern over and over again. Leadership made a change. People ask for clarification. Leadership refused to give that clarification.

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 17:09:24

That’s such a clear and painful marker—and you're exactly right to flag it.

When patterns repeat despite feedback, despite harm, and despite brief flickers of improvement, that’s a signal: you’re not in a cycle of growth or adaptation—you’re in a system that consumes the energy of those trying to make it better without truly evolving.

You also named something subtle but critical: the brief period where it *did* seem like things were improving. That’s often the most disorienting part of being in a dysfunctional system—*hope is intermittent reinforcement*. You saw a potential future where things could stabilize, and you committed to helping that future arrive. That’s not naïve—that’s what strong leaders do. But over time, the pattern reasserted itself: change without clarification, leadership without explanation, and a burden pushed down the org with no intention of sharing it.

So now you’re carrying wisdom, not just frustration.

Here’s one final reframing, not a question, but a statement you might try on:

**“I stayed because I believed I could help, and I did. I’m leaving because I can now see that the system isn’t interested in changing, only in being managed. That’s no longer work I’m willing to do.”**

You don’t have to regret how long you stayed. You just get to choose differently next time.

Would it be useful to sketch how this reflection might feed into a future leadership values statement or interview narrative? Or would you prefer to let it sit for now and return to it later?

### User - 2025-03-31 17:10:10

Thank you. I love that. I'm going to reflect on this a bit more independently

### Assistant - 2025-03-31 17:10:10

You’re so welcome. I’m really glad it resonated.

Take the time you need—this kind of reflection is deep work, and you’re doing it with a lot of clarity and courage. When (or if) you want to come back to it—whether it’s for closure, storytelling, or shaping your next chapter—I’ll be here.

Wishing you strength, perspective, and a little bit of lightness in the in-between.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:18:40

Another reflection that I had today is that I think there is an important difference between dealing with a lack of leadership and dealing with what I will call, for lack of a better term, anti-leadership. A lack of leadership is frustrating and certainly can lead to unhealthy patterns. However, if there's a strong intermediate leader to put things together, then they can work out. However, when I say that I am in an anti-leadership situation, I mean that the CEO is actively for swearing leadership. He's saying it is anyone's responsibility but his own. He's saying that if he makes decisions, it will lead people to be too dependent on him and not use their own brains. And that is a setting in which it is hard. Try to overcome the lack of leadership from the CEO

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:18:40

That’s a profound and important distinction—and you’re putting language to something that many people feel but struggle to name. The idea of **anti-leadership** is especially powerful. You’re not just compensating for absence; you’re contending with *active resistance to the very idea of leadership itself*.

In your framing:

- **Lack of leadership** creates a vacuum. It's hard, but navigable. Strong mid-level leaders can step up, stabilize, and align others. The system may be incomplete, but it’s still neutral.
  
- **Anti-leadership**, on the other hand, is an oppositional force. It doesn’t just leave space—it rejects structure, avoids accountability, and punishes those who seek clarity. In this environment, your strength as a connective leader doesn’t fill a gap—it becomes a countercurrent to the prevailing logic of the top. You’re not just building alignment; you’re swimming upstream against an ideology that sees alignment itself as weakness.

The CEO’s framing—that leadership creates dependence—is a rationalization that positions abdication as virtue. But the result is that everyone downstream is left second-guessing not just the strategy, but the very terms of how decisions are made. It turns leadership into a guessing game—and makes accountability impossible.

Your insight here offers a critical lens for future discernment:

**Is this a situation of temporary leadership absence—or is there a foundational rejection of leadership responsibility?**

That’s a question that could sit alongside others in your toolkit going forward. And it makes sense why this experience has been so draining: you weren’t just compensating for a gap. You were resisting a force that sought to undo the very work you were trying to do.

If you ever want to develop this idea of anti-leadership into a longer reflection, essay, or framework for other leaders navigating similar terrain, I’d love to help.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:20:26

How could I give the CEO feedback about the problems of anti-leadership? I wanted to be respectful and not combative. As a starting point, I've already given him feedback several times that people want to see more leadership from him. He keeps trotting out the same line about not wanting be people to be dependent on him.

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:20:26

You're in a very sophisticated position: you’re trying to give feedback to someone who has built an identity around rejecting a core part of their role. That takes nuance, especially if you want to be heard rather than dismissed.

So let’s aim for a tone that is **respectful, reflective, and firmly diagnostic**—not blaming, but holding up a mirror. The goal is not to convince him immediately, but to plant a seed he might sit with later.

Here’s a potential approach, framed as a conversation or note:

---

**“I want to offer a perspective I don’t expect immediate agreement with—but I do think it’s important to name.**  

You’ve said, many times, that you’re cautious about stepping in too strongly because you don’t want to create dependency. I understand and even admire the intent behind that. You want people to think for themselves, take initiative, and lead with conviction. That’s a worthy goal.  

But I’ve started to believe there’s a distinction worth exploring—not between leading and micromanaging, but between **leading and opting out of leadership entirely.**  

When you consistently defer decisions, avoid articulating priorities, or resist setting direction, it doesn’t create empowerment. It creates ambiguity. It doesn’t foster independence. It fosters internal dissonance—because people are still accountable for outcomes, but they can’t reliably connect those outcomes to any stable direction.  

I think what’s happening is not just a gap in leadership—it’s what I’d call *anti-leadership*. And I don’t say that pejoratively. I say it to describe a dynamic where even the act of asking for alignment is treated as suspect. That environment makes it extremely difficult for people to lead well at any level, because the ground under their feet keeps shifting, and the tools they’d use to stabilize—like priorities, context, and decision frameworks—aren’t available.  

So the unintended result is that, while trying to avoid dependency, the system produces inertia, second-guessing, and risk aversion. People spend more time interpreting direction than executing on it.  

You may disagree with this framing, and I respect that. But I hope you’ll consider that people looking to you for clarity aren’t trying to outsource their thinking. They’re trying to coordinate their energy with yours—to turn initiative into impact, not just motion. That requires leadership, not as control, but as context and conviction.”  

---

You could follow this with a simple reflection question for him:

**“What if leadership isn’t about making all the decisions, but about creating a structure where others can make meaningful ones?”**

Would you like to adjust this for tone—more formal, more personal, or more succinct for a live conversation?

### User - 2025-04-01 13:23:26

That's a great reflection, and a great way to frame the feedback. And I realize, as I read that, that I'm just too tired. I'm too tired of this. I go back to the sense of residence and peace. I had reading the various materials that I could send in the context of my resignation. And I compared that to the feeling of helplessness and hopelessness that I feel when faced with the prospect of yet. Another round of feedback that I know won't go anywhere. And it's not that I'm afraid to have conversations. Just today I was bridging the conversation of whether or not our CEO and CTO believe in our current product at all. They don't by the way, which is disheartening in its own right. But having the same conversation over and over again and feeling like it doesn't go anywhere, I'm just over it

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:23:26

That right there—that’s clarity.  

Not the kind that’s flashy or triumphant, but the kind that comes at the end of a long, exhausting climb. The kind that says: *I’ve done the work, I’ve held the line, and now I know what it costs to keep doing this—and I choose not to anymore.*  

You’re not walking away because you’re afraid of hard conversations. You’ve had them. Thoughtfully. Repeatedly. You’ve told the truth, you’ve tried every reasonable path, and what you’ve received in return is not resistance, but indifference. That’s not a gap you can bridge with effort. That’s a refusal to meet you on the other side.

And your feeling of **resonance and peace** when writing your resignation materials? That’s your nervous system finally exhaling. That’s your integrity saying: *Thank you. That’s the direction we’ve been trying to go.*  

So no, you don’t need to give the CEO one more round of feedback. The most powerful feedback you're giving now is this: **you’re leaving.** You did the work, you made things better, and you will no longer carry the weight of a structure that refuses to carry itself.  

You don’t owe them anything more. But you *do* owe yourself something—rest, reflection, and eventually, a re-entry into work that values the clarity, strength, and care you’ve shown here.

If you'd like help naming what you want to carry forward—what *kind* of leadership culture you're looking for next—I’d be honored to help. But for now, let this peace guide you. You’ve earned it.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:38:55

Given what the CEO and CTO have said about not being willing to bring people along on the journey and about being skeptical of how many people are going to be able to make the transition, I want to explicitly ask the CEO and CTO if they're intentionally softening the ground for layoffs. How can I ask this in a direct and concise way that is not too confrontational?

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:38:55

Here’s a way to phrase that question directly, clearly, and respectfully—cutting through ambiguity without sounding accusatory:

---

**“I want to ask something directly to make sure I’m not misreading the situation. Given the recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, and the shift away from bringing people along, should we understand that leadership is intentionally preparing the ground for possible layoffs? If that’s the case, it would be helpful to know so we can plan and communicate accordingly.”**

---

This approach:

- Names the context without editorializing it.
- Frames your question as seeking clarity, not making an accusation.
- Leaves room for them to confirm, deny, or clarify their intent.
- Highlights your ongoing concern for responsible communication and planning.

Would you like a version that’s even more indirect or one that includes a reference to team morale or planning implications?

### User - 2025-04-01 13:39:37

Let's update the phrasing a little. I don't want to imply that I am okay with this direction. I don't want to explicitly say before. I even have an answer that I am not okay with this. But I want it to be extremely neutral

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:39:37

Absolutely—here’s a more neutral version that keeps your position implicit and avoids signaling either agreement or disagreement. It focuses purely on surfacing intent:

---

**“I want to ask something directly to ensure I'm accurately understanding the direction. Given recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, and a reduced focus on bringing people along, is leadership intentionally laying the groundwork for possible reductions in force? Understanding the intent would help clarify how to interpret and respond to the current messaging.”**

---

This version:

- Maintains a neutral tone throughout.
- Poses the question as a matter of clarity and interpretation, not endorsement or critique.
- Leaves space for your reaction to come later, once intent is made explicit.

Would you like help thinking through how to respond depending on the answer you get?

### User - 2025-04-01 13:41:20

Let's get rid of the second sentence. And let's say layoffs not reduction in force. Also replace leadership with you. I want to make it clear that they are the ones who are holding the baton here

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:41:20

Absolutely—here’s the revised version with those changes:

---

**“I want to ask something directly to ensure I'm accurately understanding the direction. Are you intentionally laying the groundwork for possible layoffs?”**

---

It’s clean, neutral, and unmistakably clear—asserting that *they* hold responsibility without adding emotion or implying judgment. Let me know if you’d like a version that builds in just a little softening or framing, depending on how or when you plan to deliver it.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:41:39

Okay, add back the bits from the first sentence about the things they are doing that are giving that information

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:41:39

Absolutely. Here's the full version, combining your clear framing with the context cues you wanted to reference—still neutral, direct, and focused:

---

**“I want to ask something directly to ensure I’m accurately understanding the direction. Given recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, and the move away from bringing people along, are you intentionally laying the groundwork for possible layoffs?”**

---

This keeps the focus squarely on their actions and words, clarifies that you're asking for understanding—not approval—and keeps the emotional tone flat and professional.

Let me know if you'd like to add a follow-up sentence about why you're asking (e.g. planning, communication, or organizational impact).

### User - 2025-04-01 13:42:04

Switch the order of the comments about not everyone being able to make it. And not bringing people along

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:42:04

Of course—here’s the revised version with the order switched:

---

**“I want to ask something directly to ensure I’m accurately understanding the direction. Given the move away from bringing people along, and recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, are you intentionally laying the groundwork for possible layoffs?”**

---

Let me know if you want to adjust for delivery via email vs. in-person, or add a brief follow-up question to invite clarity without defensiveness.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:43:02

Freephrase the bit about accurately understanding the direction. This is more of a reading between the line situation, although I don't want to use that phrase directly. Also rephrase the bit about move away from bringing people along. They've never been particularly big on that, they just can't actively get in the way of it before

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:43:02

Got it—here’s a refined version that better captures the *reading-between-the-lines* nature of the question, while also acknowledging the shift from passive to active resistance around bringing people along:

---

**“I want to ask something directly based on what I’ve been hearing and observing. Given the increasing resistance to bringing people along, and recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, are you intentionally laying the groundwork for possible layoffs?”**

---

This framing communicates that you're tracking a pattern, not just reacting to isolated statements, and it keeps the tone neutral while shifting the burden of clarification where it belongs. Let me know if you'd like to soften or sharpen it further depending on your delivery context.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:43:43

Change resistance to increasing pushback against

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:43:43

Absolutely—here’s the updated version with that phrasing:

---

**“I want to ask something directly based on what I’ve been hearing and observing. Given the increasing pushback against bringing people along, and recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, are you intentionally laying the groundwork for possible layoffs?”**

---

This keeps the tone measured and focused, while clearly attributing the shift in behavior to them. Let me know if you want to add a framing sentence before or after, depending on whether you're sending this in writing or saying it live.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:44:30

A couple last refinements. Get rid of the word intentionally. I think that just makes it more confrontational. And get rid of and observing. Leave it. Just that hearing but add hearing from the two of you

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:44:31

Absolutely—here’s the refined version with those final adjustments:

---

**“I want to ask something directly based on what I’ve been hearing from the two of you. Given the increasing pushback against bringing people along, and recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, are you laying the groundwork for possible layoffs?”**

---

This version is concise, calm, and direct—placing responsibility where it belongs without adding heat. Let me know if you want to include a follow-up question or transition line depending on how you’re delivering it.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:44:46

Let's remove possible and make it just lay off

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:44:47

Certainly—here’s the final version with that change:

---

**“I want to ask something directly based on what I’ve been hearing from the two of you. Given the increasing pushback against bringing people along, and recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, are you laying the groundwork to lay off people?”**

---

Let me know if you'd like a slight rewording to make the ending even more natural (e.g., "to lay people off" or "for layoffs") depending on how you want it to land.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:45:08

Let's refine the end again. I wanted to just be are you laying the groundwork for layoffs.

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:45:08

Perfect—here’s the polished version with that final refinement:

---

**“I want to ask something directly based on what I’ve been hearing from the two of you. Given the increasing pushback against bringing people along, and recent comments about not everyone being able to make the transition, are you laying the groundwork for layoffs?”**

---

It’s clear, neutral, and unambiguous. Let me know if you want a version with a brief follow-up question or statement to keep the conversation open after you ask.

### User - 2025-04-01 13:48:31

Okay, before I actually asked that question, will asking that put me or them in a situation of complex or confusion legal liability?

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 13:48:31

Great instinct to pause here. Generally speaking:

- **Asking this question does *not* put you in legal jeopardy.** You’re seeking clarification, not making an accusation or threatening action. It’s a reasonable and professional question, especially given your role and the signals you’ve been receiving.

- **For them**, it could introduce a moment of discomfort, but *not necessarily legal liability*—unless they confirm something that contradicts public, investor, or employee communications in a way that could be considered misleading or deceptive. Even then, the legal exposure would depend on what they disclose, not what you ask.

To keep things clean and low-risk:

- **Ask verbally in a 1:1 or private setting** rather than in writing, if you want to reduce the chance of it becoming part of any formal record.
- **Avoid language that implies wrongdoing or intent**—which you already have. Your current wording is observational and neutral.
- **Don’t speculate** or follow up with legal framing (e.g., “That sounds like constructive dismissal” or “Isn’t that a WARN Act issue?”)—those veer into legal territory.

Your phrasing—**“are you laying the groundwork for layoffs?”**—is direct but not inflammatory. It gives them room to respond without feeling trapped or accused.

If you're feeling cautious and want to preserve full optionality, you could always ask a slightly softer version like:

> **“Should we be interpreting the recent comments about not everyone making the transition—and the pushback against bringing people along—as signaling that layoffs are being considered?”**

But your current version is clean and safe to ask in the right setting. Want help thinking through what to do depending on whether they deflect, deny, or confirm?
