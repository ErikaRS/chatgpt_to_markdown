Good questions for a 30 minute hiring manager screen for an Engineering Manager. 

Job description:
Why this job is exciting
At Sourcegraph, we see code search and the code graph as big data challenges. We handle tasks like indexing multi-terabyte monorepos, indexing clusters of hundreds of thousands of repos, providing fast & high-quality ranking, and extracting a code graph which is used throughout our products. 
As Engineering Manager, Search & Graph, you’ll utilize both your leadership skills and technical acumen. You will be instrumental in propelling Sourcegraph’s Cody  to become the top AI coding assistant and our Code Search product to become the “Google of Code Search”. You will lead a team of high-agency, self-directed team mates and  will have opportunities to dive in and be deeply technical yourself. You will report directly into the Head of Engineering, Search & Platform. 
Your deep experience in high-scale sharded-computation will help us define the scalability story for our search engine. Your experience in programming language tooling will help us extract a code graph that can be used to power a platform that drives everything from search and navigation to providing the best context for an LLM. 
Within one month, you will…
Take responsibility for two distributed, FAANG-bar teams, roughly a half dozen engineers, and lead them as a front-line manager. Your organization will grow as the company grows.
Work closely with other Engineering department heads on cross-functional initiatives that touch Cody and Code Search. 
Within three months, you will…
Identify any gaps you see in the Engineering org and help address them in an appropriate way, bringing prior experience to bear in recommending and driving solutions.
Build a variety of systems, many of which are systems that you yourself may already know we need, and are not listed here. A few examples include
a hybrid search architecture which combines modern ML and traditional search techniques for natural language search
extending our code graph to cover an ever growing set of languages with every easier configuration
a search quality measurement and reporting system
Within six months, you will…
Champion customer engagement in all phases of design, development and deployment. 
Within one year, you will…
Have hired and retained exceptional people to make our team even more representative of the world’s population.
Collaborate with product and engineering leadership to develop the next set of ambitious goals that your org should work towards.
Develop a clear technical and execution strategy to achieve that next set of goals.
About you 
You are an experienced, customer-driven manager who works from a place of compassion and curiosity. You have experience working with highly technical customers across business sectors. You can represent your team with customers roughly as if you were a rotation engineer on the team. You can work across departments to align requirements and priorities from a broad set of engineering, product, and business stakeholders. You are strongly aligned with our values, inspired by our mission to make it so that everyone can code, and motivated to do your best work at Sourcegraph.
You find joy in solving complex problems in the search and code graph spaces. You have personal domain expertise with more than one of modern data pipelines, mapreduce-family batch processing, data representations, or programming language tooling such as compilers, build tools, static/semantic analysis, or language servers. You may not code everyday, but you are eager to jump into the code for anything from answering a customer question to fixing a bug to adding some new functionality. 


Qualifications:
You have at least 4 years of experience managing engineering teams and 5 years of hands-on coding experience.You have held a high technical bar for teammates as well as yourself.
You have relevant domain knowledge and experience in one or more of the following areas: search, indexing, information retrieval, relevance, compilers, build tools, static/semantic analysis, language tools.
You can work effectively across multiple programming languages with and without prior experience.
You share our values, and work in accordance with those values.
Nice to haves:
You have worked with search quality
You have experience with machine learning
You have worked with technologies such as AWS, GCP, Azure, Spark, Hadoop, BigQuery, JVM, .NET, C++.
