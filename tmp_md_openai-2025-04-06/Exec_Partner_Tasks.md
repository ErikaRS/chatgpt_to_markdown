An Executive Business Partner typically works closely with a senior executive to provide administrative, operational, and strategic support. This may include tasks like managing schedules, coordinating meetings, conducting research, and helping with decision-making processes. They often act as a liaison between the executive and other staff members, and may also assist with project management and execution of business strategies.
