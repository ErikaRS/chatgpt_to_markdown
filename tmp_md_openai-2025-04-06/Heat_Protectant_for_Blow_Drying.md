Videos about using a blow dryer on hair always strongly recommend using heat protection. But then the amount of heat protectant they use is so lightly sprayed it's not touching all the hair. Is that actually useful? Should they be using more? Or is heat protectant for drying  just a marketing gimmick?

Heat protectant products for hair are designed to reduce damage from heat styling tools like blow dryers. They generally contain ingredients that form a protective barrier over the hair shaft, helping to reduce moisture loss, prevent cuticle damage, and minimize the impact of high temperatures.

The effectiveness of heat protectants and the amount needed can depend on several factors:

1. **Hair Type and Texture**: Different hair types and textures might require different amounts of product. Thicker, coarser hair might need more protectant than fine hair.

2. **Product Formulation**: Some heat protectants are designed to be lightweight and require only a small amount to be effective. Others might need to be applied more generously.

3. **Heat Level**: The higher the temperature of the styling tool, the more protection your hair might need.

4. **Application Technique**: Even distribution is key. While it may seem that only a small amount is being sprayed, as long as it's evenly distributed, it can be effective.

5. **Purpose of Use**: Some people use heat protectants to add additional benefits like smoothing, adding shine, or detangling, which can influence how much they apply.

While it's possible that some products are not as effective as claimed, or are marketed more aggressively than necessary, many heat protectants do provide a measurable level of protection against heat damage. It's always a good idea to use some form of heat protection when regularly using heat styling tools, but the exact amount and type of product can vary. If you're unsure, consulting with a hair care professional about your specific hair type and needs can be helpful.
