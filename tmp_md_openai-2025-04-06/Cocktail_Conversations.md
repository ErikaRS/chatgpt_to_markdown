Two glasses shimmer in the ambient light,
One pink and frothy, a delicate delight.
The other, clear with a citrusy zest,
Each sip a journey, each taste a quest.

They sit together on a polished wood,
Whispers of laughter, a moment understood.
One a vibrant blush, like a sunset's kiss,
The other golden, a promise of bliss.

In their simplicity, stories unfold,
Of evenings cherished, of secrets told.
Two cocktails, side by side, complete,
A symphony of flavors, a moment sweet.
