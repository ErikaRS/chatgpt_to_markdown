Come up with ten 5 word titles for this piece. No subtitle, just a main title.

Sometimes you are solving a problem directly. Other times, you are setting up the environment in which others will solve a problem. What’s the best way to set others up for success? The default answer, at least in organizational settings, is to create a process. When people need to accomplish a task, they pull out the process definition, go through the steps, and find success! If the process is well structured it may be accompanied by a tool which turns part of the process into structure. 
But is process always the right answer? Process certainly gets something of a bad rap. Process is the realm of pointless bureaucracy where you have to submit a form to get a new pen. It’s the realm of suppressed creativity where you have to stick to a certain narrative structure because that’s what is required by the assignment. However, processes can help complicated procedures like surgery to be more successful by ensuring that the right actions are taken in the right order. 
Instead of always turning to process when setting up a problem solving environment, we can expand our toolset by looking at the challenge at hand through the cynefin framework. Defining a process is often effective when the problems you are asking others to solve are complicated. The process can help people systematically go through the steps needed to solve the problem.  For example, when an employee is hired, there’s a fairly standard procedure to follow, but there are often small exceptions: they need to start on an atypical day; they need special equipment; they are going on leave 2 weeks after their start date; etc. A process helps people gather the data they need, analyze it systematically, and develop the right solution.
When someone is solving a simple problem, going through a process feels like overhead. Imagine if an employee had to go through a checklist every paycheck. That would be tedious for everyone involved. Simple problems can often be solved manually. However, if they’re frequent enough it can be worth using the second tool in our set: structure. By adding structure to a simple problem, we can make it more efficient and less tedious. Direct deposit is an example of structure being used to solve the problem of payroll. Structure can also help move a problem from the realm of complicated into the realm of the simple. (This example points out an interesting asymmetry: problems don’t present the same level of challenge to everyone. Getting a paycheck should be simple. Managing payroll, on the other hand, is complicated.) Note that structure can also be used to simplify processes. The Checklist Manifesto is all about how a structured tool, the checklist, can help add consistency for the simpler components that make up part of a complicated procedure. 
When it comes to helping people solve complex problems, things get harder. By their very nature, we can’t encode the right answer in a structure or give a step by step process for how to figure out the right answer. We can’t even be sure there is a right answer. The tool we can give people tasked with solving a complex problem is context. They will need to navigate this unknown landscape on their own, but we can tell them everything we know about it. For example, a product manager who needs to come up with a roadmap for a product whose growth is flattening needs to know about the current user base and why they use the product, potential user bases, things the company has tried in the past that did and did not work, and much more. 
When things get chaotic, even context is not sufficient because what was true yesterday may have very little bearing on what is true today. In chaotic situations, the best we can do is arm people with probing tools. We can give people the means to learn about what is currently true in their environment. For example, in the midst of a contentious merger, we might advise people to spend less time on formal, structured presentations and instead have many small conversations to learn how different stakeholders are thinking about priorities.   
When we find ourselves in a position where we need to enable others to solve problems, we can resist the instinct to define a process and instead ask ourselves about the nature of the challenge. Is this a problem we can solve by putting a simple structure in place, like a template or an automated process? Is it a creative or innovative challenge where we should provide context about the environment so they can explore effectively? Is this a shifting and dynamic challenge where we should teach people how to be aware of the shifting sands? If so, then there are better solutions than process. However, when the the challenge we are faced with is one of navigating through a space of varied but understood solutions, then a process may be exactly what you need.

What are 5 options that capture the idea that these are specifically tools for helping others within an organization solve problems, not personal problem solving tools. (They can but, but the main point is that this is about finding the right way to help others solve problems)

Critique this article. Give feedback on clarity, especially on how clearly it lies out the framework and how clearly it communicates that this is about setting up structure so that others can solve problems.

**Critique of the Article**

**1. Clarity:**
The article does an admirable job diving into the nuances of problem-solving in organizational settings. It weaves in the challenges of processes, the Cynefin framework, and the need to provide different tools for different problem types. However, the clarity could be further enhanced:

- **Opening section:** The introduction sets the stage by discussing the default solution of creating processes. It's well-articulated, but the transition from processes to the Cynefin framework is not as smooth as it could be.
  
- **Use of examples:** The examples provided, such as the one about an employee being hired or about managing payroll, are helpful for understanding. However, more illustrations could be integrated to demonstrate the different facets of the Cynefin framework. 

**2. Communication of the Framework:**
The Cynefin framework is introduced somewhat abruptly. The reader would benefit from:

- **Clearer introduction:** A concise definition or overview of the Cynefin framework at the outset would help anchor the subsequent discussions.

- **Visual aid:** The Cynefin framework, given its categorization nature, would be better understood with a visual representation. A simple diagram or chart could be beneficial.

**3. Emphasis on Setting up Structures for Others:**
The article's premise is about setting up environments for others to solve problems. While this is touched upon, a few enhancements could make this clearer:

- **Explicit statements:** The idea of "setting up for others" could be reiterated more frequently to drive home the point.

- **Contrast:** By contrasting the differences between personal problem-solving and organizational problem-solving, the reader could get a clearer understanding of the article's focus.

- **Reframing examples:** Some examples, like the one about direct deposit, focus more on the solution itself rather than emphasizing how it was set up for others to solve subsequent problems.

**4. Overall Flow and Structure:**
While the article covers a lot of ground, the flow could benefit from some restructuring:

- **Section headers:** Breaking the article into sections with headers, such as "The Role of Processes," "Introducing the Cynefin Framework," "Structures vs. Processes," etc., would make the content more digestible.

- **Conclusion:** A succinct conclusion summarizing the main points and reiterating the importance of setting up structures for others would wrap up the article effectively.

**In Summary:**
The article provides valuable insights into problem-solving within organizations and the importance of processes and structures. With some enhancements in clarity, a clearer introduction to the Cynefin framework, and a stronger emphasis on the primary objective of setting up environments for others, it could resonate even more effectively with its intended audience.
