The ideas listed can be arranged on a spectrum from more individualistic to less individualistic as follows:

1. Formal equality of opportunity
2. Meritocracy
3. Equal opportunity
4. Inclusive meritocracy
5. Fair equality of opportunity
6. DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion)
7. DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging)
8. JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion)
9. Anti-racism
10. Equality of outcome

Formal equality of opportunity is the most individualistic idea, as it focuses on ensuring that everyone has the same starting point but does not address systemic barriers. Meritocracy and equal opportunity share similar principles, with meritocracy emphasizing the importance of individual talent, skill, and effort. However, equal opportunity goes a step further by addressing some barriers faced by historically disadvantaged groups.

Inclusive meritocracy expands upon the concept of meritocracy, taking into account a broader range of talents and skills and promoting a diverse workforce. Fair equality of opportunity, on the other hand, works to eliminate systemic barriers and provides individuals with necessary resources to achieve success.

DEI, DEIB, and JEDI are progressively less individualistic, as they each emphasize the importance of collective action to address systemic inequities. DEI focuses on promoting diversity, ensuring equitable treatment, and fostering inclusive environments. DEIB adds the concept of belonging to the mix, highlighting the need for everyone to feel valued and respected in a diverse community. JEDI goes even further by advocating for justice and addressing systemic issues at their roots.

Anti-racism is an active approach to identifying, challenging, and dismantling racist policies and practices, placing it further along the less individualistic side of the spectrum. Finally, equality of outcome is the least individualistic idea, as it seeks to ensure that all individuals achieve the same results, regardless of their initial circumstances.

Historically, the concept of meritocracy gained prominence in the 20th century as an alternative to aristocracy and other hereditary systems of social stratification. However, as awareness of systemic barriers and unequal access to opportunities grew, ideas like inclusive meritocracy, fair equality of opportunity, and diversity initiatives (e.g., DEI, DEIB, JEDI) gained favor. These concepts have evolved over time to better address historical injustices and promote social equity. Conversely, the concept of equality of outcome has generally fallen out of favor, as it is often seen as incompatible with the values of individual freedom and personal responsibility.

Which terms are currently in favor? With whom and why? 

### Assistant - 2023-05-07 08:49:16

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the following terms are currently in favor with various stakeholders, including governments, educational institutions, private corporations, and social justice activists:

1. Inclusive meritocracy: This term is popular among organizations and individuals who advocate for a broader definition of merit that takes into account diverse talents, skills, and backgrounds. By doing so, they aim to create a more equitable and diverse workforce that better reflects society as a whole.

2. DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion): DEI has gained widespread adoption across various sectors, as organizations recognize the importance of promoting diversity, ensuring equitable treatment, and fostering inclusive environments. Many companies have established DEI programs and initiatives to address these issues and create more inclusive cultures.

3. DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging): Building on DEI, DEIB adds the concept of belonging, emphasizing the importance of creating environments where everyone feels valued, respected, and able to contribute their unique perspectives. This term is gaining popularity as organizations increasingly recognize the need to foster not only diverse and inclusive environments but also a sense of belonging among employees and members.

4. JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion): This term has been embraced by activists and organizations that focus on systemic change and social justice. JEDI expands upon DEI to include the pursuit of justice, addressing structural inequalities and advocating for policy changes to create a more equitable society.

5. Anti-racism: Anti-racism has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly following the Black Lives Matter movement and protests against racial injustice. This term is popular among activists, educators, and organizations working to dismantle racist systems, policies, and practices. Anti-racism goes beyond promoting diversity and inclusion by actively challenging and addressing racism at its roots.

It's important to note that these terms and their popularity can evolve over time. Different stakeholders may prefer or prioritize specific concepts depending on their goals, values, and context.

Which terms have fallen out of favor and why? Are there groups that still prefer those terms?

### Assistant - 2023-05-07 08:50:40

Some terms that have fallen out of favor or are less popular in mainstream discourse are:

1. Meritocracy: While meritocracy as a concept is still valued by many, the term has faced criticism for oversimplifying the idea of merit and overlooking systemic barriers that create unequal access to opportunities. Critics argue that meritocracy can perpetuate existing inequalities by rewarding those with greater access to resources and reinforcing the status quo. However, there are still groups and individuals, especially in business and political circles, who advocate for meritocracy as a principle of fairness and efficiency.

2. Formal equality of opportunity: This concept, which emphasizes equal access to opportunities without addressing systemic barriers, has been criticized for being insufficient in promoting true social equity. While it may still be preferred by some who emphasize individual responsibility and a laissez-faire approach to social issues, many others have moved towards more comprehensive frameworks, such as fair equality of opportunity, to better address historical injustices and structural inequalities.

3. Equality of outcome: This term has become less popular, as it is often criticized for being incompatible with individual freedom and personal responsibility. Critics argue that focusing on equality of outcome may lead to a disregard for individual differences and preferences and could undermine incentives for hard work and innovation. However, some leftist groups and proponents of more radical social and economic reforms may still advocate for this concept as a means to address systemic inequality and redistribute resources more equitably.

It is essential to recognize that the popularity of these terms may vary across different contexts, regions, and political environments. Groups and individuals may still prefer certain terms based on their ideological stances, experiences, or specific goals.

Tell me more about inclusive meritocracy. Is that actually in common use?

### Assistant - 2023-05-07 08:52:06

Inclusive meritocracy is not as widely used a term as others, such as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). However, the underlying concept of inclusive meritocracy is gaining attention and support among various stakeholders, including governments, educational institutions, and corporations.

Inclusive meritocracy builds on the idea of meritocracy, which is the belief that power, positions, and resources should be distributed based on merit, i.e., individual abilities and achievements. However, it acknowledges that the traditional notion of meritocracy often overlooks systemic barriers, privileges certain skills and knowledge, and perpetuates existing inequalities. Inclusive meritocracy aims to address these issues by taking a more holistic approach to recognizing and rewarding merit.

The key principles of inclusive meritocracy include:

1. Broadening the definition of merit: Inclusive meritocracy recognizes that merit is not limited to test scores, credentials, or traditional indicators of success. It values a wide range of skills, talents, and backgrounds, taking into account factors such as cultural capital, emotional intelligence, and adaptability.

2. Addressing systemic barriers: Inclusive meritocracy acknowledges that historical and structural disadvantages can hinder equal access to opportunities for certain groups of people. It strives to create more equitable systems and processes that take these barriers into account and provide support to those who need it.

3. Promoting diversity and inclusion: Inclusive meritocracy emphasizes the importance of creating diverse and inclusive environments where people from all backgrounds can thrive. It recognizes that diversity and inclusion are not only ethical imperatives but also essential for innovation, creativity, and problem-solving.

4. Encouraging continuous learning and development: Inclusive meritocracy values growth and development, fostering a culture that encourages continuous learning, feedback, and improvement.

While the term "inclusive meritocracy" may not be as commonly used as others, its principles and ideas are gaining traction as organizations and institutions work to create more equitable and inclusive systems. Many companies and organizations are already implementing initiatives that align with the principles of inclusive meritocracy, even if they don't explicitly use the term.

Can you give specific organizations or speakers who are moving toward inclusive meritocracy as a term?

### Assistant - 2023-05-07 08:53:03

While the term "inclusive meritocracy" may not be as widespread as other diversity and inclusion-related terms, there are several organizations, thought leaders, and speakers who are advocating for or discussing the concept. Some examples include:

1. Deloitte: Deloitte, a global professional services firm, has been advocating for inclusive leadership and using the term "inclusive meritocracy" in their publications. They emphasize the importance of broadening the definition of merit and creating an environment where all employees can reach their full potential.

2. Dr. Rohini Anand: Dr. Rohini Anand is an expert in diversity and inclusion who has served as the Global Chief Diversity Officer for Sodexo. She has written about the concept of inclusive meritocracy and its importance in achieving gender equality in the workplace. Dr. Anand emphasizes the need to recognize and address systemic barriers to create a truly inclusive meritocratic culture.

3. Avivah Wittenberg-Cox: Avivah Wittenberg-Cox is a global expert on gender balance and CEO of 20-first, a gender balance consultancy. In her work, she advocates for more inclusive definitions of merit and argues that organizations need to move beyond traditional meritocracy to foster greater diversity and inclusion.

These examples demonstrate the growing interest in and discussion around inclusive meritocracy as a concept. However, it is essential to note that organizations and thought leaders may use different terminology or focus on specific aspects of inclusive meritocracy without explicitly using the term itself. As the conversation around diversity, equity, and inclusion continues to evolve, it is possible that inclusive meritocracy will gain more traction and become more widely used.
