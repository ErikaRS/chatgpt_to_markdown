Suppose a company has two products. One is a coding assistant. Another is a more big picture, command center sort of product that helps people understand the big picture view of a code base. The latter is currently called Code Search but that no longer feels reflective of the broader command center purpose. What are some alternate product names?

Creating a product name that reflects its purpose and functionality can be challenging, but it's also an exciting opportunity for creative thinking. Here are some suggestions for the 'big picture' command center product:

1. **CodeSight**: This implies a broad perspective and understanding of the codebase.
2. **CodeCompass**: As a tool that helps guide you through a project.
3. **CodeGalaxy**: Implies a wide, expansive view of all the parts of the code base, like stars in a galaxy.
4. **CodeNavigator**: Similar to compass, it suggests a tool that helps navigate through code.
5. **CodeScape**: This name suggests a comprehensive view, like a landscape of your codebase.
6. **CodeAtlas**: Reflects a resource for comprehensive navigation and understanding.
7. **CodePanorama**: Implies a wide view covering all areas of the code base.
8. **CodePulse**: Conveys the feeling of keeping your finger on the pulse of the codebase.
9. **CodeMatrix**: Suggests a complex network of code that this product helps to understand.
10. **CodeSphere**: Implies a 360-degree, comprehensive view of the code base.
11. **CodeHub**: Reflects the idea of a central place for understanding the entire project.
12. **CodeOracle**: Suggests a product that can predict or provide insights into the codebase.
13. **CodeEpicenter**: Implies that this is the central point for understanding the codebase.
14. **CodeSymphony**: Suggests the product harmonizes and makes sense of various parts of code.
15. **CodeSentry**: Conveys the feeling of overseeing, guarding and managing the code base.

Consider your target audience, the product's unique selling points, and your company's overall branding when choosing a name. The right name can say a lot about the product and can be a major factor in its success.
