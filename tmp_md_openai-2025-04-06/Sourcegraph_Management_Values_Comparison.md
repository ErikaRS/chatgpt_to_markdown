The best values are those where the opposite is a legitimately good choice under different circumstances. For example, both "move quickly" and "move carefully" could be legitimate values. On the other hand, "respect people" is not a good value because while some organizations may take the opposite as a principle in practice, no one is going to write down "disrespect people" as a value. 

From that perspective, list out some of the ways that Sourcegraph has different management values than other companies based on this essay. The goal isn't to imply that we are good and they are bad. The goal is to highlight the choices we made where there are other legitimate choices.

Leading high-performing engineering teams at Sourcegraph
At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time… and it feels like everything needed to be done yesterday. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, prioritize effectively, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed.
Ineffective managers: fixers, phantoms, and friends
Ineffective managers fall into two categories: fixers or phantoms.
The fixer jumps in at every issue, giving step-by-step instructions and solving problems themselves. This undermines autonomy, leaves engineers dependent, and stifles creativity. Fixers struggle to delegate and fail to develop their team's skills, ultimately slowing the team down.
The phantom assumes autonomy means hands-off management, offering little guidance. They avoid involvement, leaving the team without direction or support. This often leads to misalignment, wasted effort, and poor outcomes due to a lack of oversight and structure.
The friend coddles their team, fails to deliver results, and cannot effectively challenge ideas. They rely on secondhand information and avoid getting into the code when needed, which causes drag and divides the team from the company.
All three approaches hinder high agency: fixers smother it, phantoms let it run without guidance, and friends decouple it from meaningful results.
The impactful manager: coach, not hero
Impactful managers act as coaches, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute. However, impactful managers also ensure accountability by setting clear expectations, monitoring progress, and doing their part to keep projects on track. They balance empowerment with hands-on involvement to ensure that delivery standards and deadlines are consistently met.
1. Deliver business needs
Impactful managers ensure engineering delivers outcomes that benefit the business. They make sure developers don't just understand customer needs. They feel them. This enables devs to iterate quickly toward high quality solutions through internalized feedback loops.
Impactful managers understand that engineering doesn’t exist in a bubble. They ensure cross-team and cross-functional alignment, collaborating closely with Product, Design, TPM, Technical Success, and Marketing. When cross-functional partners such as Product or Design are unavailable, impactful managers advocate for those perspectives, making decisions that reflect the business as a whole. This helps ensure that engineering efforts are always aligned with larger priorities.
One of the biggest challenges we face is balancing customer-specific work with work that benefits the broader user base. Customer requests can be urgent and critical for business success, but the long-term health of the product depends on improvements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this balance, pushing back if customer requests are impeding their ability to progress on other work. 
Techniques for this:
Encourage internalized feedback loops by ensuring developers use our products in their work and directly watch/read/gather customer feedback.
Cross-functional meetings to ensure alignment with stakeholders.
Clear prioritization to weigh customer-specific work against broader product goals.
Acting as an advocate for stakeholders, ensuring decisions reflect the full company perspective.
Ineffective managers either prioritize short-term customer work to the detriment of the broader product or overlook customer needs, causing friction between teams.
2. Prioritize and push for delivery
At Sourcegraph, starting work is easy... but finishing is what delivers value. Impactful managers are hands-on, working alongside their teams when needed, whether by participating in coding or providing direct feedback. They ensure teams prioritize tasks that deliver the most value to customers and the business. Every engineer should understand how their work moves the business and the developer experience forward.
Techniques for this:
Prioritization of projects in Linear, getting stakeholder input and escalating decisions when needed.
Timeboxing work to focus on deliverables.
Regular check-ins to ensure alignment on goals and progress on top priorities.
Ineffective managers either allow the team to spread too thin or fail to prioritize, leading to activity without output.
3. Cultivate high agency
Impactful managers build autonomy by asking the right questions rather than providing all the answers. However, there are times when providing answers directly is crucial, especially when clarity is needed quickly. This helps avoid unnecessary delays when the path forward is already known, such as when reacting to competitive pressures. Impactful managers balance fostering autonomy with providing guidance as needed, ensuring that engineers are expected to act fast, take ownership, and make decisions in the best interest of developers and the business. When engineers face challenges, impactful managers guide them to think through solutions, helping them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.
Techniques for this:
One-on-one coaching to help engineers think critically.
Socratic questioning to guide engineers to solutions.
Feedback on RFCs and project overviews to help engineers outline their thought process.
Ineffective managers either solve problems themselves or fail to address them, preventing engineers from growing their autonomy.
4. Assess team performance
Who is on the team is likely the single most important factor in team success. Impactful managers assess their team members to understand how best to utilize their strengths. They identify bullets—people who can effectively execute tasks when given clear direction—and barrels—people who can "aim" and take ownership of a project end to end. Delegating effectively means knowing which tasks are best suited for bullets and which require the strategic ownership of barrels.
Flagging signs of underperformance quickly is crucial. Impactful managers deliver direct feedback to address issues early, ensuring that everyone is set up to contribute effectively to the team's goals.
Techniques for this:
Identify bullets and barrels to understand team strengths and delegate effectively.
Deliver direct feedback to address underperformance early.
Set clear expectations to ensure alignment on responsibilities and outcomes.
5. Create conditions for effective execution
Impactful managers set clear goals aligned with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. Everything we do is for developers, and every effort is aimed at delivering results that make a tangible impact. Projects should be well scoped and defined, giving teams clarity and purpose without micromanagement.
Impactful managers encourage developers to get into the zone where they internalize feedback loops as much as possible. This state allows them to make rapid, informed decisions that boost productivity and enjoyment. Anything outside this zone is significantly less productive and less enjoyable.
Impactful managers enable alignment and accountability by promoting transparency within their teams and across the entire organization. They create a culture where honest feedback is encouraged, allowing teams to learn quickly from both successes and failures.
Impactful managers trust their engineers to execute once the goals are clear, but they do not abdicate their responsibility. They actively monitor progress, provide timely feedback, and intervene when necessary to ensure that delivery meets quality and time expectations. They expect engineers to take responsibility for delivering results, while maintaining transparency in how progress is communicated. When roles and responsibilities are clearly assigned, teams can work autonomously while staying connected to the broader vision.
Techniques for this:
Getting into the zone by internalizing feedback loops to make rapid and informed decisions.
Kickoff meetings should define objectives, set expectations, and assign clear roles.
Transparent communication provides open information flow and regular feedback.
Clear roles and responsibilities enable alignment while preserving autonomy.
Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving teams without a clear sense of purpose. Without transparency and clear guidance, teams lose focus and momentum, ultimately affecting the impact of their work.
6. Balance speed and stability
Speed and stability are not at odds; they often go hand in hand. True velocity pairs fast execution with solutions that enable greater stability in the future. Impactful managers ensure that engineers build solutions that meet today’s needs effectively, while also laying the foundation for future growth. We strive for simple, robust, and easy-to-modify code, which allows us to move quickly without compromising quality. This means addressing today’s problems efficiently, without overbuilding or accumulating technical debt.
Impactful managers hold a high bar for both speed and stability, recognizing that sustainable speed is achieved through maintaining quality. Engineers are expected to take ownership of their code’s quality—delivering quickly while ensuring the codebase remains scalable and maintainable.
A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to velocity investments—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. (Testing and documentation are always required.) This approach reduces technical debt build up. Additionally, impactful managers identify code hotspots that slow development and prioritize cleanup projects to address them.
Techniques for this:
Schedule planning that accounts for 25% of time for velocity improvements.
Tracking hotspots in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.
Ineffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term stability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt. Or they allow their teams to build overengineered designs that are hard to modify as requirements change. Both these create teams that execute slowly.
7. Celebrate wins and build resilience
Impactful managers celebrate wins and frame failures as opportunities to drive future success. They celebrate wins, big or small. They frame failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.
Techniques for this:
Demo days and company demos to showcase achievements and celebrate progress.
Retrospectives to learn from mistakes (and successes!)  without assigning blame.
Public recognition (e.g., in #thanks and #progress) to reinforce team successes and build momentum.
Ineffective managers either ignore achievements or punish failure, creating a culture of fear rather than innovation.
Conclusion: nurture high-performing teams
At Sourcegraph, impactful managers empower their teams to focus on what matters, take action, and deliver real value to customers and the business. They are hands-on. They create an environment where autonomy thrives, accountability is embraced, and every challenge is an opportunity to learn and improve.

Model set context updated.

### Assistant - 2024-10-06 19:59:01

Based on the essay you shared, here are some key management values at Sourcegraph where other companies might make different, but equally legitimate, choices:

1. **High Agency vs. Detailed Direction**  
   - At Sourcegraph, managers emphasize fostering high agency by asking questions and letting engineers think through problems. This promotes autonomy and ownership.  
   - A legitimate alternative is a more directive management style, where managers provide detailed instructions, especially in fast-moving or highly regulated environments where precision and consistency are crucial.

2. **Balancing Speed and Stability**  
   - Sourcegraph values a balance between moving quickly and maintaining stability, with a focus on building scalable, maintainable code.  
   - Another valid approach would prioritize speed above all, accepting higher technical debt to capture market opportunities faster, especially in hyper-competitive industries where short-term gains outweigh longer-term technical concerns.

3. **Empowerment vs. Centralized Control**  
   - Managers at Sourcegraph encourage empowerment and transparency, trusting teams to deliver once objectives are clear.  
   - Conversely, some organizations might centralize control, especially in situations where leadership needs to maintain tight alignment across a large organization or in industries where risk management is paramount.

4. **Prioritizing Long-Term Product Health vs. Immediate Customer Requests**  
   - Sourcegraph balances customer-specific work with broader product goals, making sure urgent customer requests don’t overshadow long-term product health.  
   - Other companies might prioritize customer satisfaction more heavily, addressing immediate customer needs first to secure deals or maintain key client relationships, even if it risks longer-term technical debt or feature complexity.

5. **Direct Involvement vs. Hands-Off Autonomy**  
   - Impactful managers at Sourcegraph strike a balance by being involved when necessary but fostering autonomy and accountability in their teams.  
   - Another valid approach could be very hands-on management, particularly in high-risk projects, or conversely, a more laissez-faire style in creative environments where independence is valued above all else.

6. **Continuous Learning vs. Failure Avoidance**  
   - Sourcegraph frames failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging experimentation and resilience.  
   - In contrast, some organizations prioritize risk avoidance, focusing on minimizing failures and strictly adhering to proven processes, which may be appropriate in industries with high regulatory or safety standards.

These differences highlight management values at Sourcegraph without implying superiority—just choices based on different circumstances and goals.

Come up with more, especially areas where Sourcegraph varies from conventional advice on how to be a good manager

### Assistant - 2024-10-06 20:00:57



### Assistant - 2024-10-06 20:00:57

Here are additional areas where Sourcegraph’s management values differ from more conventional management advice, emphasizing how Sourcegraph’s approach can diverge from typical guidelines:

1. **Actively Prioritizing Developer Experience vs. Purely Business-Driven Goals**  
   - At Sourcegraph, impactful managers focus on delivering business needs but do so by ensuring engineers internalize and feel customer feedback. Developer experience is treated as an equally important part of this balance.
   - Conventional advice often stresses prioritizing pure business outcomes over employee experience, where managers might push for business-driven metrics without emphasizing how the process impacts the engineering team’s motivation and engagement.

2. **Coaching as the Primary Role vs. Heroic Leadership**  
   - Sourcegraph champions the idea of managers as coaches who help teams solve problems independently, avoiding a “heroic” leadership style where the manager swoops in to fix issues.  
   - Conventional management advice may often lean toward managers who take decisive action themselves, especially in crisis situations or when immediate results are necessary. Sourcegraph’s focus on coaching might be seen as slower but ultimately builds long-term team capability.

3. **Challenging Customer Requests for Product Health vs. Always Saying Yes to Customers**  
   - Sourcegraph managers are encouraged to push back when customer-specific requests interfere with broader product goals, balancing immediate customer satisfaction with the long-term integrity of the product.  
   - Conventional wisdom, particularly in customer-driven environments, might encourage always accommodating customer requests to secure revenue or maintain relationships, even at the expense of long-term product health.

4. **Fluid Leadership Involvement vs. Fixed Role Boundaries**  
   - Sourcegraph managers shift between being hands-on when necessary and stepping back when engineers are capable of delivering autonomously, adapting their involvement level based on context.  
   - More conventional advice suggests keeping clearer boundaries between roles—e.g., a manager should always be more strategic and hands-off, trusting the team fully to execute, or should always be more directive.

5. **Celebrating Small Wins vs. Only Celebrating Major Milestones**  
   - Sourcegraph places emphasis on celebrating both big and small wins to build momentum and team morale, which encourages continuous improvement.  
   - Traditional management might prioritize celebrating only significant achievements, focusing on larger milestones, and overlooking smaller successes that contribute to the larger picture.

6. **High Trust with Accountability vs. Micromanagement for Consistent Results**  
   - Sourcegraph managers operate with high trust, giving engineers autonomy while ensuring clear accountability. This is balanced with light but consistent oversight.  
   - Conventional advice often emphasizes closer tracking of every step to ensure consistent results, especially in large organizations or high-stakes projects where control is viewed as key to avoiding mistakes.

7. **Mixing Business and Engineering Accountability vs. Separating Them**  
   - Sourcegraph’s impactful managers make sure engineers are deeply tied to business needs and understand their impact on the company's success. Engineers are not just builders but also advocates for customer and business needs.
   - Conventional approaches often maintain a separation between business accountability (held by product, marketing, or sales) and engineering execution, where engineers focus purely on technical delivery without needing to worry about broader business outcomes.

8. **Managing Individuals as “Bullets and Barrels” vs. Universal Management Approaches**  
   - Sourcegraph’s nuanced approach of identifying “bullets” (people who execute when given direction) and “barrels” (people who can take end-to-end ownership) tailors delegation to individual strengths.  
   - A more traditional view might promote the idea of managing everyone uniformly, applying a one-size-fits-all approach to task delegation and leadership expectations.

9. **Encouraging Cross-Functional Involvement vs. Staying in Your Lane**  
   - Sourcegraph managers actively promote cross-functional collaboration and will advocate for absent stakeholders when making decisions, taking on roles beyond their immediate responsibility to ensure alignment.  
   - Conventional management advice may suggest staying within defined lanes—engineering managers focus on engineering, product managers on product—without stepping into cross-functional areas unless explicitly required.

10. **Balancing High Agency with Hands-On Guidance vs. Letting Engineers Sink or Swim**  
   - Sourcegraph’s managers balance fostering autonomy with stepping in when needed for clarity, rather than completely hands-off delegation or fully managing every decision.  
   - Traditional management styles might embrace more extremes—either letting engineers sink or swim entirely on their own to “prove” their capability or micromanaging to ensure no mistakes are made, often based on organizational risk tolerance.

These areas reflect how Sourcegraph’s values sometimes challenge more conventional management approaches. They often prioritize longer-term team growth, developer experience, and cross-functional alignment over short-term wins or strict adherence to narrowly defined roles.

Make the beginning more like: "Effective managers at Sourcegraph won't look like effective managers at other companies." Then work in a very brief pointer to the ideas below to give the flavor of the environment we are operating in. Then point to the X and Y pairs as illustrations of areas we made an intentional choice to support operating effectively in that environment. 

The idea below: 
Here's what you can expect as part of the Sourcegraph team:

Things move fast and change often: We move quickly and adapt swiftly. In the rapidly evolving world of AI and dev tools, we iterate fast and ship often. You'll need to think on your feet and be comfortable with change. We seek out high-performing individuals who excel in dynamic, fast-paced environments and we value those who can navigate ambiguity, take initiative without constant oversight, and turn uncertainty into opportunity. 
We’re hands-on and results-oriented: Everyone at Sourcegraph cares deeply about what we do and how it affects our users and customers. This means you'll see our co-founders coding, you'll get feedback on projects from people outside your immediate team, and we expect you to be an active contributor and speak up if you see ways we can improve. We do whatever it takes to get things done (including working late nights and weekends when necessary).No job is too big or too small, regardless of your role, because we’re all focused on delivering tangible results that move the needle for our company and our customers.
We’re ambitious: Our goal is to become the indispensable tool for every dev on the planet. We tackle complex challenges head-on and constantly push the boundaries of what's possible. We expect everyone, regardless of role, to bring their A-game and to never settle for "good enough". We're here to build the most impactful company in our space, and that requires our team members to reach the pinnacle of their field. 


### Assistant - 2024-10-06 20:10:37

Effective managers at Sourcegraph won’t look like effective managers at other companies. In our fast-moving, ever-evolving environment, we value adaptability, hands-on involvement, and a relentless focus on results. Things change quickly here, and we need managers who thrive in ambiguity, take initiative without needing constant oversight, and empower their teams to deliver tangible outcomes. You'll find our co-founders coding alongside engineers and team members across functions stepping in to provide feedback, all aligned on pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

We’ve made intentional management choices to support this dynamic environment. For example, we prioritize cross-functional involvement over staying within strict role boundaries, and we focus on building high trust and accountability rather than relying on heavy oversight. We believe success comes from empowering teams with high agency and the right level of guidance, not from rigid direction or hands-off management. These are just a few examples of how we’ve shaped our approach to foster effectiveness in our unique environment.

### User - 2024-10-06 20:11:22

What other contrasting idea pairs seem most relevant to add to this? 

### Assistant - 2024-10-06 20:11:37

In addition to the contrasting idea pairs of **cross-functional involvement vs. staying in strict role boundaries**, **high trust and accountability vs. heavy oversight**, and **high agency with guidance vs. rigid direction or hands-off management**, the following pairs could also be relevant:

1. **Adaptability vs. Predictability**  
   - Sourcegraph thrives on quick iteration and change, whereas many companies prioritize predictability and fixed plans. At Sourcegraph, managers need to embrace ambiguity and adapt rapidly, rather than expecting a stable, predictable environment where plans rarely shift.

2. **Hands-On Leadership vs. Delegation-Only Approach**  
   - Managers at Sourcegraph are hands-on and get involved where needed, even stepping in to code or provide direct feedback. In contrast, many organizations emphasize a delegation-only approach where managers remain strategic but distant from day-to-day execution.

3. **Results Over Process vs. Process-Oriented Management**  
   - Sourcegraph focuses on tangible outcomes, prioritizing results and impact over rigid processes. Other companies may place a higher emphasis on strict adherence to process, viewing it as the key to efficiency and control.

4. **Empowering Ownership vs. Top-Down Direction**  
   - We empower engineers to take ownership and make decisions, trusting their judgment. This contrasts with companies that prefer top-down direction where decisions come primarily from management to ensure alignment.

Adding any of these idea pairs would reinforce how Sourcegraph’s environment encourages fast-moving, flexible, and empowered teams, in contrast to more conventional management approaches that favor stability, process, and top-down control.
