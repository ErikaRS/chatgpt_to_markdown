This feels a bit "meh". Make it more crisp and motivating

- All roles on Cody Core and Code Search and Context are SF targeted unless noted. Backend roles are not location restricted. 
-- Dec 3, 2024 addendum: 
--- Given the progress we made on SF hiring (4 roles: 2 PM, 1 Eng IC, 1 Eng manager), we are loosening up the location restrictions.
--- The logic behind continuing to focus on SF for Cody Core, Code Search, and Context is that these teams benefit most from having a very tight feedback loop with PM. Cody Core and Code Search because they own the bulk of the UI. Context is a core part of our differentiation strategy.
