What is a term for micromanaging but upward instead of downward?

The term you're looking for is probably "managing up". Managing up refers to the process of managing your relationship with your boss or other superior, with the aim of ensuring that both you and they are as effective as possible. This can include anticipating needs, communicating effectively, and helping them to see your perspective or understand your needs. It's important to note that "managing up" is not about manipulation or subterfuge; it's about building a healthy, productive working relationship.

Managing up is good, but I was looking for something that also captured the negative aspects of micromanaging.

The term you might be thinking of is "reverse micromanagement" or "upward micromanagement." These terms are not as commonly used, but they can describe situations where an employee excessively tries to control or influence their superior's actions, often to the point of being disruptive or counterproductive. This can occur when an employee oversteps boundaries, overanalyzes decisions, or insists on being too involved in their superior's processes. 

It's important to understand that while some degree of upward influence (like "managing up") can be beneficial and even necessary in certain situations, "upward micromanagement" can harm relationships, create unnecessary tension, and undermine the necessary hierarchy within an organization.
