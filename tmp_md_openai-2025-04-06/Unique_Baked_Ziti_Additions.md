What are some unexpected ingredients I could put in baked ziti?

Sure, I can suggest a few unexpected ingredients you can try adding to your baked ziti to mix things up a bit:

1. **Non-traditional Cheese:** While mozzarella and Parmesan are standard, try using smoked gouda or sharp cheddar to give a different twist to the flavor. Feta or goat cheese can also provide a tangy twist.

2. **Veggies:** Beyond the usual tomato sauce and garlic, you might want to include unexpected veggies like roasted butternut squash, mushrooms, spinach, or zucchini for added texture and flavor. 

3. **Protein:** Instead of the usual Italian sausage or ground beef, you could experiment with grilled chicken, shrimp, or even diced tofu or tempeh for a vegetarian version. 

4. **Pickled or Fermented Foods:** Try adding pickled jalapenos or olives for a tart, tangy note. Capers or pickled onions could also work well. You could even experiment with adding a small amount of kimchi or sauerkraut for a unique twist!

5. **Herbs and Spices:** Herbs and spices are a great way to introduce unexpected flavor. Consider rosemary, smoked paprika, za'atar, or even a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg. 

6. **Nuts and Seeds:** Toasted pine nuts, slivered almonds, or pumpkin seeds could add an interesting crunch.

7. **Fruit:** This might seem out of place, but small amounts of certain fruits can bring a surprising and delicious twist. Consider finely chopped figs, dates, or sundried tomatoes (technically a fruit!).

8. **Grains:** Mixing in cooked grains like quinoa, farro, or barley can add an interesting texture and make the dish even more filling.

9. **Seafood:** If you're adventurous, small bits of anchovy or flakes of canned tuna can add a rich, umami flavor.

Remember, when adding these unexpected ingredients, you'll want to make sure they're cooked (if necessary) and properly seasoned before adding them to your pasta and cheese. Enjoy experimenting with your baked ziti!
