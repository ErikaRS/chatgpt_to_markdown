The following notes are chapter-by-chapter notes from a book about exposure in photography. Write a 3-7 paragraph review of the key points, keeping the original tone and language of the notes as much as possible. The summary should include the key points as well as surprising or interesting takeaways. 

The tone should be:
Objective and Informative: Your review offers a balanced, objective view of the book, focusing primarily on conveying information about the book's content, key themes, and practical applications rather than passing subjective judgments or opinions.

Structured and Organized: Your review is well-structured and systematically organized. It follows a logical flow, beginning with an overall impression, then diving into the key ideas, concepts, and practical takeaways, before concluding with a summary of the book's value.

Clear and Concise: You employ clear, concise language, making the review easy to understand. You succinctly summarize complex ideas, making them accessible to the reader.

In-Depth Analysis: You provide a detailed, in-depth analysis of the book's content. You don't just skim the surface or give a vague overview; you delve into specific ideas, theories, and principles discussed in the book.

Balanced Perspective: You acknowledge the book's strengths as well as its limitations. For instance, you note that the team topologies introduced in the book aren't one-size-fits-all solutions and that organizations will need to adapt them to their specific context.

Reflective: Towards the end of your review, you reflect on how the principles in the book align with your own philosophy. This personal touch adds authenticity to your review and provides a unique perspective for the reader.

Recommendation: You conclude the review with a recommendation, based on your assessment of the book's value and relevance to a specific audience. This final note helps guide potential readers in deciding whether the book might be useful to them.

The notes follow:
The third edition of this book was published to better cover the advances in digital photography. It also adds new images. 

The introduction sets out the purpose of the book: all of camera manufacturers additions to make it easier to take photographs have created a plethora of options that make it harder to understand the core elements of exposure. Although these settings can work well, when they don't, they leave the photographer with little understanding of how to get the effect they want. 

This wasn't mentioned in the introduction, but to capture it somewhere, a key part of the value in this book is the many many photographs with notes about how they were exposed. These serve to illustrate the theory with concrete example. 

- *Exposure* "refers to the amount, and act, of light falling on photosensitive material"
- The right exposure is the "correct" exposure. This means that the exposure which achieves the creative intent of the photography. 
- Exposure is determined by three elements of the *photographic triangle*:
    - Aperture: How widely the hole that lets in light is opened. 
        - The full stop values for all lenses are f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, and f/22
        - Moving between these halves / doubles the amount of light. Moving from one stop to the next smaller stop is called *stopping down*.
        - The larger the number, the smaller the hole.
        - Technically, 'f' is the focal length, so f/4 means that the size of the opening is the focal length divided by 4. That's why larger numbers mean smaller openings.
    - Shutter speed: How long sensor is exposed to light.
        - This is the amount of time that the sensor is exposed, in fractions of a second. 
        - So, e.g., shutter speed of 125 means that the shutter is open 1/125th of a second.
        - Moving between stops (halving/doubling the light) is a matter of simple multiplication with shutter speed: e.g., 125 let's twice the light of 250.
        - The math isn't exact, but standard shutter speed stops are: 1/250, 1/125, 1/60, 1/30, 1/15
    - ISO: The sensitivity to light. For film, this was an inherent property of the film. For digital cameras it is a configurable sensitivity for the digital sensor.
        - You can think of this as approximately how much "effort" the sensor puts into gathering light. 
        - Higher numbers mean more effort, with a linear mathematical relationship, so ISO 200 gathers twice as much light as ISO 100, all else being equal.
        - However, higher ISO increases the amount of noise in the image and reduces the sharpness and contrast, so it's better to keep the ISO as low as works for the given conditions. 100 or 200 are good targets to aim for, with 400 being acceptable.
        - At the time that this book was written, the author did not recommend going above 400 ISO. Modern digital cameras have less noise at higher ISOs, so it's worth testing with your camera as to what is an acceptable upper bound in different conditions. 
- The light meter is a critical tool for determining whether or not you have a technically correct exposure. 
    - The light meter assesses a scene and determines whether or not the scene is under exposed, over exposed, or balanced. 
    - The general goal is to go for a balanced exposure (0, +/- 1/3 stop).
    - If you can't get a perfectly balanced exposure, it's better to go for a slightly under exposed image.  
    - (Some of this information comes from later)
    - However, there is nuance: there are different ways of measuring exposure: at a point, over a larger area, over the whole image. Look at your camera manual to find out more.
    - Also, the light meter assumes that overall exposure should be targeting 17% overall luminance. 
    - This works on average, but for black or white objects (e.g., a black cat or snow), this average luminance will result in a dull image, pushing everything toward gray.
    - A photographic gray card can be used to get the right exposure (or your hand if you've figured out the right correction factor relative to a grey card). 
    - When metering against something not your subject, make sure to put the card/hand in the same light as the photographic subject to ensure correct metering. 
- White balance
    - White balance controls the color temperature of the taken image. Higher temperatures are more blue (7000-11,000K), lower temperatures are more red (2000-4000K). Daylight is between 4000-7000K.
    - Although this has an important impact on the final image, it's also easy to adjust in post-processing (especially when processing RAW files), so it's not worth stressing over. 
    - The author's preferred white balance setting is "Cloudy", even when it's not cloudy. It tends to give a fairly warm image, which is the author's preference. 
    - You can use white balance for artistic effect such as using the cooler "Tungsten" white balance at dusk for richer blue skies or even at other times to give a blue tint that can be reminiscent of moonlight. 
- The one artistically correct exposure
    - Although there are many combinations of Aperture and Shutter Speed which give the same exposure relative to the light meter reading, they have different artistic impacts. 
    - The "correct" exposure is the balanced exposure that realizes the creative vision of the photographer. 
- Seven creative exposure options
    - As a rule of thumb, you can divide exposures into 7 categories which have different creative properties
    - Aperture dominance exposure options
        - Story telling exposures
            - Small apertures keep most of the image in focus: they have great depth of field. 
            - f/16, f/22, f/32
        - Singular-theme / isolation exposures
            - Large apertures have a shallower depth of field that puts focus on a small portion of the photo.
            - f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6
        - "Who cares?" exposures
            - Middle apertures have maximum sharpness and are useful when depth of field isn't a concern. This is most often when the image doesn't have much depth, such as taking a picture of a person against a wall.
            - f/8, f/11
        - Macro / close-up exposures
            - These images have to deal with the optical reality that for a given aperture and lens, the depth of field is shallower the closer the subject is to the lens. 
            - This can be used creatively to get specular highlights (these days more often called bokeh).
    - Shutter speed dominant exposure options
        - Freeze action exposures
            - Faster shutter speeds (1/250, 1/500, 1/100) freeze motion creating a clear image even of fast moving subjects.
        - Panning exposures
            - Moderate shutter speeds (1/60, 1/30, 1/15) allow the photographer to pan the camera and capture a sharp image of the subject with some background blurring.
        - Implied motion
            - Super slow shutter speeds (1/4, 1/2, 1) can be used to capture longer exposures the imply motion. 
            - This can be done by keeping the camera still (e.g., blurring water)
            - It can also be used by moving the camera/lens through intentional camera motion (e.g., zooming in on the subject to imply motion)

Aperture controls depth of field. 
    - The wider the aperture, the more blurred the background.  This can be used to separate the subject from the background. 
    - The narrower the aperture, the more in focus everything is. 
- Storytelling Apertures
    - Storytelling images of broad scenes often call for narrower apertures to keep the whole scene in focus.  (f/16, f/22, f/32)
    - Note that concerns about smaller aperture leading to less sharpness are overrated. While it is true that sharpness decreases at the smallest apertures, with modern cameras and lenses, it's generally only noticeable if you zoom very close, 200% or more. The creative possibilities of small apertures are worth the small loss of sharpness. 
    - You still need to choose a focal point for the image. To prevent the foreground from being blurry, the best focus is generally achieved by setting the focus fairly close, e.g., a couple feet into the scene. That ensures sharpness throughout, including in the foreground. 
    - Smaller apertures are well matched with wide angle lenses which allow you to capture a large area.
    - When composing with narrow aperture, think about what goes in your foreground, midground, and background. 
    - With wide angle lenses in particular, you can significantly increase the quality of the image by getting really close to your foreground subject. 
    - When taking an image of a faraway subject, one way to add foreground interest is to frame the subject, e.g., with plants. 
- Isolation or Singular-Theme Apertures
    - Large lens openings (f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6) are useful for isolating the subject from the background. 
    - This can be used to reduce the business of the subject. 
    - It's not always a more or better situation: some background detail can add context / interest. 
    - The blurring can be used to good effect by putting a subject (e.g., a person) far from a colorful background and using a isolation aperture to turn it into an abstract colorful background.
- "Who cares?" Apertures
    - These apertures are good when there is not much depth of field (f/8, f/11).
    - There apertures maximize sharpness and contrast for most lenses so when depth of field isn't a concern, they're a great choice for producing high quality images.
    - Examples of where these are good are a shell on a beach or a person against a wall.
- Aperture and Macro Photography
    - Macro photography can capture amazing detail from objects, both natural and man-made. 
    - In general, the same concerns about storytelling vs isolation apply for macro photography.
    - However, when a lens is close to a subject, the depth of field will be quite small. Even at small apertures, the image will have some blurring. At large apertures, it can be hard to get even a small subject all in focus. 
    - Also, when so close up, even small amounts of movement can feel like 50mph wind gusts. 
    - Macro photography highly benefits from a tripod / beanbag / steady elbows to allow for the longer shutter speeds that are needed to support narrower apertures. 
    - One way to make macro photography easier is to photograph subjects with less depth overall (e.g., the side of a boat or a feather against a rock)
    - But the impact of depth of field can also make stunning images, such as water droplets against an abstract background or abstract closeups of flowers or oil droplets.
- Aperture and Specular Highlights
    - Sources of light can create stunning specular highlights when apertures are wide. This will be round when the aperture is fully open and shaped like the aperture fins (usually hexagonal) when it is less than full. 
    - One way this an be used it to give the impression of a perfectly circular sun or moon by using a wide aperture with a light source behind.

Freezing motion 
    - Short shutter speeds freeze motion. Depending on the subject, the needs may vary. For example, sports photography might require shutter speeds of 1/500 or 1/1000 of a second to not get blur.
    - Factors to consider when freezing motion are:
        - The distance between you and the subject
            - The closer the subject, the faster the shutter speed because they will move more quickly relative to you.
        - The direction the subject is moving
            - Subjects moving perpendicular to you requires faster shutter speeds, again because they move more quickly relative to you.
        - Lens choice
            - Longer lenses make you effectively closer and so require faster shutter speeds
    - When trying to freeze motion, it can help to use continuous focus and burst mode to increase your odds of getting a good shot
- Panning
    - Panning involves deliberately moving the camera parallel to and at the same speed as the motion
    - The goal is to get the subject in focus while capturing motion in the background
    - It's important to pick a background that will blur well. If your subject is against a solid blue sky, for example, you may as well just freeze the motion. 
- Implying motion 
    - Implied motion shows the moving subject as a blur while stationary items are in crisp focus
    - Using a tripod is critical to get good results. 
    - 1/4 second can be enough to imply motion
    - Water is a typical implied motion subject, but wind can also provide good opportunities
    - You can also imply motion with a stationary subject, e.g., by moving the camera or zooming the lens. 
    - As an aside, you can create compelling photos by using a sprinkler to create artificial rain and using the drops to imply motion

Every exposure is built on a foundation of the available light
- Although it's not true that "light is everything" — creative exposure is equally important — light is important
- However, you don't need to do anything different to expose for the light. The same principles of creative exposure apply.
- The light does make a big difference though. The same photograph can feel very different depending on whether it is taken when the sun is or is not behind a cloud. A nice composition can become dramatic in stormy light. 
- One recommended exercise is to try taking pictures of the same scene at different times of day and different times of year to learn the different qualities of light.
- Frontlight
    - Frontlight is when the front of your subject is lit (*not* when the light is in front of you). 
    - Frontlight evenly illuminates a subject and can reduce visible shadows. It's very forgiving and easy to expose for.
    - However, the best natural frontlight is available only for the first hour after sunrise and the last hour before sunset. 
    - It can result in flat looking images.
- Overcast frontlight
    - This is considered to be the "safest" form of lighting, making for easy exposures and no shadows. 
    - It's good for natural looking portraits.
    - It can result in rich colors, especially if the sky is not in the photo.
    - If the sky is in the photo, it can result in dull photos.
    - It can result in flat looking images.
- Sidelight
    - Sidelight gives a sense of three-dimensionality. Photos can elicit a much stronger reaction since it better simulates how people see. 
    - It's available several hours after sunrise and several hours before sunset. 
    - It can be challenging to expose for because of the combination of light and shadow.
    - Whether your subject is macro, a portrait, or a story telling exposure, sidelight can provide added depth.
    - Exposing for sidelight may require finding an evenly lit part of the scene and using that to meter the exposure.
- Backlight
    - Backlight occurs when the subject is between the camera and the light.
    - The backlit subject will often appear as a silhouette.
    - Effective backlit photography requires finding the right place to meter.
        - When taking a picture that involves the sun (e.g., sunrise, sunset) and you want the sky properly exposed and the foreground in silhouette, meter against the sky to the *side* of the sun.
        - If you want the subject correctly exposed, fill the frame with the subject, meter for that, move back, recompose, and take the exposure.
        - To photograph backlit somewhat transparent subjects you can silhouette by exposing for the light beyond the subject. If you want to expose for the subject, meter the light falling on the subject itself. You can also meter the subject against the strong backlight to balance the two.
- Exposure Meters
    - Exposure meters, usually built into the camera these days, help to choose the creatively correct exposure. 
    - Center weighted metering looks at the whole scene but biases toward the center
    - A spot meter measures light at a narrow angle in the field of view
    - Evaluative metering matches the image against a library of images (presumably using ML magic) to help choose the right exposure.
    - Which one of these to use depends on the scene .
- 18% Reflectance
    - The exposure meter assumes that the scene should have overall 18% reflectance. 
    - This is true on average, but not for every dark for very light scenes.
    - Perhaps unintuitively, a dark scene requires you to reduce exposure to compensate and a light scene requires you to increase composure to compensate. This is because the 18% reflectance pushes everything toward gray.
    - An easy way to do this correctly is to use a grey card.
    - Since hands also have a moderate reflectance, another trick is to calibrate your palm. Use a grey card to balance the exposure. Then put your hand in the same light and see what the exposure meter reads (e.g., +2/3 to 1 stop over exposed). Now, if you don't have a grey card expose for your hand and adjust to the same level of over exposure. 
- The Sky Brothers
    - Brother Blue Sky: On sunny days, expose for the blue sky to be properly exposed for any subject.
    - Brother Backlit Sky: When shooting backlit landscapes, take a meter reading to the side of the sun to have a beautifully exposed sky with the foreground in shadow.
    - Brother Dusky Blue Sky: For scenes at dusk, meter from the the dusky blue sky for proper overall balance without over exposing the sky.
    - Brother Reflecting Sky: When taking an exposure by water at sunrise or sunset, take a meter reading from the light reflecting off the water to have beautiful water.
    - Note that when you use these, your light meter will show as having an inappropriate exposure when you recompose. That's fine. Just ignore it and take the exposure.
- Mr. Green Jeans
    - When exposing imagines with a lot of green in them, you can take a meter reading off a green area and expose for -2/3. 
    - This works because green's reflected value is a bit shy of neutral grey (18% reflectance). Green at -2/3 matches neutral grey in reflectance. 
- Night and low-light photography
    - With modern digital cameras it is possible to take high quality low light and night photography.
    - The key is long shutter speeds and a tripod. 
    - It can take extra effort to go out before dawn or after sunset but you can get spectacular photographs that stand out.
    - For low light photography, the sky is one of the best way to take a correct exposure, no matter the lighting conditions.
    - Use the same aperture guidelines you would for daylight photography. Just expect significantly longer shutter times.

Polarizing filters
    - Polarizing filters reduce glare and is one filter that every photographer should have.
    - They can reduce glare off of water.
    - They can reduce haze in landscapes. 
    - However, they only help to the degree that the light is at a 90 degree angle to you.
    - If you must make images in the harsh light of midday, they can always help because the sun is always at a 90 degree angle.
    - In the morning or late afternoon, polarizing filters help when facing the north or south. 
    - You can use polarizing filters at other angles, but the effect will be less. If you're facing into or directly away from the light, they'll have pretty much no effect
    - On grey or rainy days they can reduce the dull grey glare of reflected light.
- Neutral density filters
    - Neutral-density filters reduce the exposure of a scene
    - This means that you can use smaller apertures or longer shutter speeds
    - Because you can use smaller apertures, they effectively increase you depth of field
    - They allow allow for "cotton candy" long exposure shots of water
    - They can also help reduce overexposure on the bright days, allowing you to use larger apertures for creative effective even when it's sunny
- Graduated neutral density filters
    - These are filters that are clear on one side and an ND filter on the other (usually 1/2 or 1/3). They are useful for darkening the sky for better balance between sky and foreground in landscape images. 
    - Be sure to make sure the graduated filter is properly aligned with the horizon though!
- Multiple exposures
    - While it's possible to create multiple exposures in post processing, many cameras can do a 2 image multiple exposure in camera. 
    - This allows for creative possibilities. It can be used to imply motion. 
    - It can also allow for creative compositions such as exposing for the moon and then composing a scene where you want the moon to appear. 
- HDR 
    - A high dynamic range image better simulates the range of brightness the human eye can see. 
    - It requires taking at least 3 images that are exposed for, respectively, the low-lights, mid-lights, and high-lights. 
    - The broader the contrast, the more images are needed.
    - HDR requires post processing (at least, when this book was published)
    - Software is used to combine the images into one with a full dynamic range. Different options impact the overall image giving different effects.
    - A tripod is a must for HDR images since it's critical that all of the exposures are perfectly aligned. 
    - Any motion in the exposures will show up as ghosting in the combined images, so HDR is best suited to still scenes.
- Fill flash
    - Even under daylight conditions, a fill flash can be used to better expose subjects in high contrast scences
    - Expose for the part of the image that won't be impacted by the flash.
- Ring flash
    - A ring flash can be useful for macro photography to ensure that the subject is evenly lit
    - Good lighting allows for faster shutter speeds. This is critical when you want to use small apertures to maximize your depth of field at macro distances.
    - You can also use a ring flash to light up your subject and render a distant background darker, for a "natural" black background composition.
- Rear curtain sync
    - Be default, the flash occurs at the beginning of an exposure. The flash is the main source of light for an image.
    - In rear curtain sync, the flash occurs at the end of the exposure.
    - This allows you to get the creative exposure of a long exposure while using a flash at the last moment to illuminate a near subject.
    - This can make for some interesting night photography because it allows a long exposure image while still capturing a sharp

The third edition of the book on exposure in photography offers a comprehensive guide to understanding and mastering the core elements of exposure, particularly in the context of digital photography. The book acknowledges the multitude of options and settings available on modern cameras, which can often be overwhelming and hinder photographers from achieving the desired creative effects. To address this, the book emphasizes the importance of understanding exposure and provides practical insights through numerous photographs with accompanying exposure notes.

The key elements of exposure, known as the photographic triangle, are explained in detail. Aperture, which controls the size of the hole that lets in light, is described using full stop values such as f/4, f/5.6, and f/8. Shutter speed, the duration the sensor is exposed to light, is discussed in fractions of a second, with common stops including 1/250, 1/125, and 1/60. ISO, the sensitivity to light, is explained as a configurable setting for digital sensors, with higher numbers gathering more light but potentially introducing noise and reducing sharpness.

The importance of using a light meter to achieve technically correct exposure is emphasized. The book explains different methods of measuring exposure, including spot metering, center-weighted metering, and evaluative metering, each with its own considerations. It also highlights the need to account for the 18% reflectance assumption made by exposure meters and provides techniques like using a grey card or calibrating with one's hand to achieve accurate exposure.

The book delves into creative exposure options, categorizing them into seven types based on the dominance of aperture or shutter speed. It covers aperture settings for storytelling, singular-theme or isolation, and "who cares?" situations, as well as macro photography. The effects of shutter speed on freezing action, panning, and implying motion are also explored. The author provides practical tips for achieving desired effects and suggests using a tripod or steady support for longer exposures.

Understanding available light is another crucial aspect of exposure covered in the book. It discusses different types of lighting, including frontlight, overcast frontlight, sidelight, and backlight, and how they can affect the mood and composition of photographs. The author recommends exploring the qualities of light by taking pictures of the same scene at various times of day and year.

Throughout the book, practical advice is provided, such as recommended settings for different scenarios and explanations of the creative impact of certain exposure choices. The use of polarizing filters to reduce glare, neutral density filters to control exposure, and graduated neutral density filters for balancing the sky and foreground in landscape images is also discussed. Additional topics include multiple exposures, HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography, fill flash, ring flash, and rear curtain sync.

Overall, this book serves as an excellent resource for photographers looking to deepen their understanding of exposure. It covers a wide range of concepts, techniques, and practical considerations, allowing readers to enhance their creative control and achieve desired effects in their photographs. The inclusion of numerous example images with exposure notes adds a valuable visual element to the book, aiding in the understanding and application of the discussed principles.

One interesting takeaway from the book is the emphasis on the artistic aspect of exposure. While technically correct exposure is essential, the author emphasizes that the "correct" exposure is the one that aligns with the photographer's creative vision. This perspective highlights the importance of understanding exposure as a tool for artistic expression rather than just a technical requirement.

As a photographer, I found this book to be a comprehensive and insightful guide to exposure. The explanations are clear and concise, making complex concepts accessible. The practical examples and tips enhance the learning experience and provide inspiration for experimentation. The book aligns with my philosophy of valuing both technical proficiency and creative intent in photography.

I highly recommend this book to photographers, especially those seeking to
