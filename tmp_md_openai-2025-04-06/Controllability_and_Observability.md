What is that idea from control theory that a controller can only control a system that has less states than the controller can represent

The idea you're referring to is related to the concept of "controllability" and "observability" in control theory. This is captured by the principle known as the **"Controllability and Observability Principle"** which is fundamental in the design and analysis of control systems.

### Controllability and Observability Principle:

1. **Controllability**: A system is controllable if it is possible to move the system from any initial state to any desired final state within a finite time period, using appropriate control inputs. This implies that the controller must have enough capability (or degrees of freedom) to influence all the states of the system.

2. **Observability**: A system is observable if, based on the outputs of the system over time, it is possible to determine the complete state of the system. This means the observer (or controller in some contexts) must have enough information to reconstruct the entire state vector from the observed outputs.

### Representation and States:

The principle you're mentioning can be interpreted as an implication of the above concepts:
- A controller can effectively control a system if the number of states (or dimensions) it can represent and influence is greater than or equal to the number of states in the system. This ensures that the controller can manage all possible states of the system, achieving controllability.
- If the system has more states than the controller can represent, then the controller cannot fully manage or influence the system, leading to a lack of controllability.

This concept is crucial in control system design, ensuring that controllers are designed with sufficient complexity to handle the dynamics of the systems they are intended to control.

That sounds right but I feel like there's another term. Maybe one that starts with the letter. R

The term you're thinking of is likely **"Requisite Variety."**

### Requisite Variety:

**Requisite Variety** is a concept from cybernetics and systems theory introduced by W. Ross Ashby. It is often summarized by Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety, which states:

> "Only variety can absorb variety."

### Explanation:
- This means that for a controller (or regulatory system) to effectively manage a system, the controller must have at least as much variety (number of states or degrees of freedom) as the system it is trying to control.
- In simpler terms, the complexity of the controller must match or exceed the complexity of the system for the controller to effectively regulate or control the system.

This principle applies broadly across various domains, including engineering, biology, and organizational management, emphasizing that the ability to handle complexity requires an appropriate level of complexity in the controlling or regulatory mechanism.
