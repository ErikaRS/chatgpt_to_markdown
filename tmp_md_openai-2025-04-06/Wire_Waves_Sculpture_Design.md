{"size":"1024x1024","prompt":"A delicate wire sculpture of waves made from a single continuous piece of aluminum wire, with an intricate and flowing design. The waves have a rhythmic, undulating pattern, capturing the motion and energy of the sea. The sculpture uses no more than 85 inches of wire, emphasizing the minimalism and elegance of the design. The aluminum wire is polished, giving the waves a subtle reflective quality, and the entire piece is balanced on a small, discreet base that doesn't detract from the sculpture's form."}
