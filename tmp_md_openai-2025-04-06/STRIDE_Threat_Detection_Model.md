The **STRIDE** threat detection model is a framework developed by Microsoft for identifying and categorizing potential security threats to systems or applications. It is particularly useful in threat modeling, helping teams systematically assess risks and vulnerabilities. STRIDE is an acronym, where each letter represents a different type of threat:

1. **S**poofing: This refers to impersonation attacks, where an attacker pretends to be another entity (e.g., a user or system) to gain unauthorized access. Example: Faking credentials to log in as someone else.

2. **T**ampering: This involves unauthorized alteration of data, either in transit or at rest, to compromise integrity. Example: Modifying a configuration file or intercepting and changing data between a user and a server.

3. **R**epudiation: This occurs when an entity (e.g., a user) denies having performed an action, and the system lacks sufficient logs or proof to refute the claim. Example: A user claiming they didnâ€™t perform a financial transaction due to lack of logging.

4. **I**nformation Disclosure: This is the unauthorized exposure of confidential or sensitive information to entities who should not have access. Example: Exposing personal details via an unsecured API.

5. **D**enial of Service (DoS): This refers to attacks that overwhelm a system, rendering it unavailable or significantly degraded in performance. Example: Flooding a server with traffic to prevent legitimate access.

6. **E**levation of Privilege: This occurs when an attacker gains higher access rights than they should have, enabling them to perform unauthorized actions. Example: Exploiting a vulnerability to gain administrator privileges.

The STRIDE model helps teams consider security from multiple perspectives and is often used alongside other techniques like data flow diagrams (DFDs) to identify threats at different stages in system design.
