This is way too long and a bit ranty. Fix this response up. 

I feel like this thread is being a bit tough on the team. We have been throwing priority after priority on the team and not giving them time to clean things up. The reason the team hasn't been able to fully work on bug bash is because releases have been a mess for going on two months due to some changes causing instability and performance issues and the Bridgewater remote support was declared to be more important than working on bug bash and quality issues. Also, remember that we don't have two separate teams for supporting VS Code and JetBrains.  We have one team supporting both with individuals who tend to lean more one way than the other.  

Yes, we need things to get better here, and to do that we need for both JetBrains and VS Code to be stable so the team has time to work on them. 

I also think we're being a bit harsh on Kalan on gathering feedback. As both Dominic and Piotr note, we have a process right now that relies on things getting reported on slack. Sometimes these get turned into bugs and sometimes they don't. Also, the information we do get is often low on detail and hard to reproduce.

I think the more useful thing to do here is to help things get into a better state is to let the team continue to prioritize quality work and have Kalan improve the process for getting and tracking feedback.

Here’s a revised version that’s more concise and less rant-like:

---

I think we’re being a bit tough on the team here. We’ve been shifting priorities frequently without giving them the time to address quality issues properly. The recent instability in releases, along with the priority given to Bridgewater remote support over bug bashes, has meant the team hasn’t been able to fully focus on quality.

It’s important to remember we don’t have separate teams for VS Code and JetBrains support; it’s one team managing both, with individuals leaning one way or the other.

To move forward, we need stability in both environments so the team can effectively tackle the necessary improvements.

On Kalan’s feedback process, as Dominic and Piotr mentioned, we currently rely on Slack reports, which sometimes become bugs but are often incomplete or hard to reproduce. Rather than criticize, I think the better approach is to support the team in continuing their quality work and help Kalan improve the feedback gathering and tracking process.

Does this address your concerns better while maintaining a constructive tone?

Change "rather than criticize" to something more like "rather than wondering why they didn't prioritize differently" 

### Assistant - 2024-10-15 15:16:17

{
  "updates": [
    {
      "pattern": "Rather than criticize",
      "multiple": false,
      "replacement": "Rather than wondering why they didn't prioritize differently"
    }
  ]
}

It seems there was an issue when trying to make the edit. Here’s how the revised section would look with your change:

---

"Rather than wondering why they didn't prioritize differently, I think the better approach is to support the team in continuing their quality work and help Kalan improve the feedback gathering and tracking process."

You can replace the relevant part with this phrasing. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to adjust!
