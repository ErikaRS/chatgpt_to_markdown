Give me more options that are clever in the way of The Princess Bride, Hitchhikers Gift to the Galaxy, or Terry Pratchett more than they are intelligent

Ah, looking for movies with a mix of wit, humor, and cleverness, akin to the style of "The Princess Bride," "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," and Terry Pratchett's Discworld? Here are some options that capture that blend of whimsy, satire, and smart storytelling:

1. **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)** - If you haven't seen the film adaptation of Douglas Adams' classic, it's a must. While fans often prefer the book, the movie captures a lot of the humor and absurdity of the original work.

2. **Galaxy Quest (1999)** - Although just outside your 20-year window, this film is a hilarious take on sci-fi television series and their fandoms. It's about a group of actors from a space opera TV show who become real-life heroes.

3. **Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (2010)** - A visually inventive and witty adaptation of the graphic novel series, blending video game culture, rock music, and romantic comedy.

4. **The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)** - While not strictly sci-fi or fantasy, Wes Anderson's film is a visually stunning, quirky tale with a clever script and unique characters, much in the spirit of whimsical storytelling.

5. **Paddington 2 (2017)** - A charming, clever, and heartwarming film that appeals to adults and children alike, with humor and storytelling that may remind you of Pratchett's warmth and wit.

6. **Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)** - Another Wes Anderson gem, this animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's book is filled with quirky humor and clever dialogue.

7. **Stardust (2007)** - Returning to this suggestion because of its blend of humor, adventure, and a fairy tale-like narrative that captures a Pratchett-esque whimsy.

8. **Moonrise Kingdom (2012)** - Not sci-fi or fantasy, but the storytelling, characters, and humor have that offbeat cleverness you're looking for.

9. **The World's End (2013)** - Part of Edgar Wright's Cornetto Trilogy, this film blends sci-fi elements with British humor, pub culture, and themes of friendship and nostalgia.

10. **Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004 and Netflix series 2017-2019)** - Both the film and the more recent Netflix series capture a unique blend of dark humor, whimsical storytelling, and clever narrative twists that fans of Pratchett and Adams might appreciate.

These films and series play with genre conventions in fun, clever ways, offering humor, heart, and a touch of the absurd.
