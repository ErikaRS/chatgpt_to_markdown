Why did airlines start getting so strict about only two bags even if things can still fit under your seat? Was there a specific event or scandal or problem or regulatory change that caused it?

Airlines became stricter about carry-on baggage limits due to a combination of **safety concerns, operational efficiency, and revenue opportunities**, but there wasn’t a single scandal or regulatory change that forced the shift. Instead, it was a gradual tightening of policies in response to a few key factors:

1. **Overhead Bin Chaos & Boarding Delays** – As more passengers started maximizing their carry-on allowance to avoid checked bag fees (which many airlines introduced in the late 2000s and early 2010s), overhead bins frequently filled up, leading to delays while flight attendants scrambled to gate-check bags. This slowed down boarding and led to passenger frustration.

2. **Safety Concerns** – Overstuffed overhead bins increased the risk of bags falling out and injuring passengers. Additionally, in an emergency evacuation, too many loose items or oversized personal items could become hazards.

3. **Revenue Optimization** – Airlines began seeing baggage fees as a major revenue source, so they had a financial incentive to limit what people could bring onboard for free. By strictly enforcing the two-bag rule, they encouraged more people to check bags (and pay fees).

4. **Aircraft Turnaround Efficiency** – Airlines operate on tight schedules, and faster boarding means quicker departures. Enforcing a strict carry-on policy keeps people from wasting time trying to rearrange their bags to squeeze into available space.

5. **Uniformity & Policy Simplification** – Enforcing a clear two-bag policy (one overhead, one under-seat) simplifies things for airline staff, reducing arguments at the gate about what is allowed.

While there wasn’t a single scandal that triggered this shift, a few notable events may have contributed:
- **2013 FAA Personal Electronics Policy Change** – The FAA started allowing passengers to use small electronics during takeoff and landing, reinforcing the idea that personal items should fit under the seat to keep the cabin uncluttered.
- **High-Profile Passenger Disputes** – Airlines faced public backlash over inconsistent enforcement of baggage policies, pushing them to standardize their rules.
- **COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustments** – During the pandemic, some airlines limited carry-ons to reduce crowding during boarding and deplaning.

Would you like insights into how different airlines enforce this rule or loopholes some travelers use to maximize their carry-ons?
