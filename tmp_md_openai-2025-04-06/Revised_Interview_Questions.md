I am revising some interview questions after having asked them a couple times. Help by suggesting revisions. 

Question: Tell us about a time when you've collaborated with engineering teams on an initiative with a large number of stakeholders.
Problem to solve: It's not clear what the point of asking this question is.

Question: Follow-up: Can you delve deeper into the technologies that were employed in the project and describe the trade-offs you had to make?
Problem to solve: None. Goal is to see if candidate is generally familiar with the technology they are using. 

Question: Can you provide an example of a challenging project you've managed in the past?
Problem to solve: It's not clear what this question is getting at.

Question: How do you handle communication and alignment with stakeholders, especially when it comes to setting clear objectives and addressing risks and blockers? Can you provide an example of a situation where your communication skills were crucial to project success?
Problem to solve: It's too complicated, too much is going on. (Maybe move some of the complexity into another question?)
Proposed alternative: Break it into two questions:
- Describe a time when your comminication skills were crucial to helping align with stakeholders?
- Describe a situation where unexpected risks and blockers came up and how you handled it?

Question: Describe a scenario where you had to work closely with engineering teams to resolve a technical bottleneck or issue that was impeding project progress. How did you collaborate to overcome the challenge?
Problem to solve: None on its own, but feels redundant with the next question.

Can you describe a situation where you proactively identified and addressed technical risks or blockers that could have affected project outcomes? How did you mitigate these challenges?
Problem to solve: None on its own but feels redundant with the previous.

Question: Having past experience in development is a plus. Can you discuss your experience with software development and how it has shaped your approach to program management?
Problem to solve: None

Your questions are well-structured, but I see where revisions could enhance their clarity and focus. Here are my suggestions:

1. **Original Question:** Tell us about a time when you've collaborated with engineering teams on an initiative with a large number of stakeholders.
   **Revised:** Could you describe a specific project where you collaborated with engineering teams and managed multiple stakeholders? What was your role, and how did you ensure effective collaboration and stakeholder satisfaction?

   *Rationale:* This revision clarifies that the focus is on the candidate's role in managing collaboration and stakeholder satisfaction, providing a clearer understanding of what the question aims to assess.

2. **Original Follow-up Question:** No changes needed.

3. **Original Question:** Can you provide an example of a challenging project you've managed in the past?
   **Revised:** What was the most challenging project you have managed, and why was it challenging? How did you overcome these challenges?

   *Rationale:* This revision specifies that you're interested in understanding both the nature of the challenge and the candidate's approach to overcoming it, providing more insight into their problem-solving skills.

4. **Original Question:** How do you handle communication and alignment with stakeholders, especially when it comes to setting clear objectives and addressing risks and blockers? Can you provide an example of a situation where your communication skills were crucial to project success?
   **Proposed Alternative:** As suggested, breaking it into two questions:
   - Describe a time when your communication skills were crucial to aligning with stakeholders. What strategies did you use to ensure clarity and alignment?
   - Can you describe a situation where you encountered unexpected risks and blockers in a project? How did you address them, and what was the outcome?

   *Rationale:* Splitting the question into two focuses each one on a specific skill set – communication for alignment and risk/blocker management – providing a more targeted assessment of the candidate's abilities in each area.

5. & 6. **Original Questions:** These questions indeed seem to overlap. Consider combining them into one comprehensive question:
   - Can you describe a situation where you had to work closely with engineering teams to either resolve a technical bottleneck or proactively address technical risks? How did you identify the issue, and what steps did you take to mitigate it?

   *Rationale:* Combining these questions allows for a broader range of responses, covering both reactive problem-solving and proactive risk management, without being redundant.

7. **Original Question:** Having past experience in development is a plus. Can you discuss your experience with software development and how it has shaped your approach to program management?
   **Revised:** Tell us about your experience in software development. How has this experience influenced your methods and strategies in program management?

   *Rationale:* A slight revision to make the question more direct and focused on how the candidate's development experience has specifically influenced their approach to program management.

These revisions aim to make the questions more focused and clear in their intent, helping you better assess the candidate's relevant skills and experiences.
