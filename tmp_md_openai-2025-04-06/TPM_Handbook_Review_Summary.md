Help me generate a summary / review in my style for _Technical Program Manager's Handbook: Unlock your TPM potential by leading technical projects successfully and elevating your career path_

First I will include my reflections and a detailed table of contents. After that just ack because I will provide more information

## Reflections

The author clearly knows his stuff. Based on this book, this is someone I would love to work with. However, the book itself was middling for me. This is best targeted at someone who is just moving into a TPM. For someone who has been in the role or even for someone who has done non-trivial amounts of program coordination even without the TPM title, the book will come across as fairly basic. Thus, for my purpose of figuring out how to be a better manager for a TPM team, I rate it 3/5 although that reflects the fitness of the book for my purpose and my inability to personally judge how useful it would be for someone earlier in their career. 

- Did I learn? Did I acquire new information?
    - A little. There were some useful tips, but nothing really fundaentally new.
- Did I grow? Did the form of my understanding change?
    - Not really.
- Was it well written? Was it structured well, coherent, beautiful?
    - Moderate. It was very well structured. The writing was fine although a bit dry and repetitive at times.
- Did I enjoy it? Do I look back upon it fondly?
    - It was fine.
- Other thoughts

### Preface
### Fundamentals of a Technical Program Manager
### Stakeholder Management
- The more you know and understand the frameworks, network protocols, latency constraints, and availability needs of your system, the more problems you will be able to foresee.
- By design, an effort estimate does not talk about calendar time, just effort in terms of hours or days. This also does not include overhead time like waiting for a code review for a code change or getting approval. These are either separate tasks or are accounted for using time buffers based on an average length of time for the administrative task to be completed.
- I attend conferences discussing what it means to be a TPM and have written papers on what it means to be a TPM within my own organization because, as you’ll see in this book, it depends on where you are as to what the role entails.
- tailoring your tools and their usage based on the needs of your project can greatly increase stakeholder efficiency.
- Once you have a project plan, you analyze the plan and identify any risks that could arise. These can be related to tight scheduling, resourcing constraints, project dependencies, or scope concerns. Depending on the risk, you can amend your project plan to help mitigate it through mechanisms such as swarming (that is, increasing resources on a particular task to get it done quicker), in order to alleviate scheduling concerns.
- In all cases, the takeaway for the TPM is knowing what the developers are actively engaged in and getting an up-to-date look at any blockers that they may have. Regardless of the presence of a scrum master or development manager, the TPM’s role here is to facilitate unblocking the development team, either directly or indirectly, by getting the right people involved.
- When the same word or phrase has more than one meaning across different teams, it can cause immediate confusion and missed requirements.
- Stakeholders offer a different perspective on a problem or perceived risk.
- I believe that GenAI will necessarily change what we do by taking the easily repeatable and generative portions of our jobs and forcing TPMs to become prompt-engineering experts. To balance this out, I believe TPMs will need to lean hard on our emotional intelligence skills to remain relevant in the coming decade. GenAI won’t replace our ability to form relationships with our stakeholders and use empathy to drive the change we need.
- As an added bonus, I have found that the exercise of re-articulating a problem for a different audience can bring more clarity to the problem as it forces you to look at it from a different perspective.
- You’ll also develop a strategy and cadence for regular communication with your stakeholders in a mechanism called a communication plan.
- In the software context, the stand-up allows the developers to talk about what they did since the previous stand-up, what they are going to do that day, and raise any blockers that they need help navigating.
- A link to a more detailed rendition of the problem can be added but the details are left at a level that non-technical teams would likely understand: the requirements or implementation steps are not clear, and the team is seeking clarity to close it out.
- You can be excellent at delivering a project on time, but if your stakeholders are kept in the dark even where there aren’t issues, it will come across poorly. People want to know what is going on.
- Chapter 2, Pillars of a Technical Program Manager, sets out the three pillars of a TPM: project management, program management, and the technical toolset.
### Managing a Program
- Without a well-thought-out plan, a project is doomed to failure.
- The stand-up type is used in agile and non-agile settings where regular syncs are needed—often with software developers.
  This practice can be seen outside of the tech industry where daily coordination across a large team is required, such as in construction. The workers get together, and the foreman or boss goes over the assignments of each worker and the objectives for the day.
- In design reviews, the TPM uses their understanding of system design as well as the surrounding architectural landscape to influence the right design choices based on the needs of the project, team, and company.
- The development report is a weekly or every two-week report that focuses on the development efforts. It discusses how the development cycle is going, including things such as a burndown or progress chart and velocity of a sprint cycle, along with any major blockers the team or teams are facing.
- Chapter 4, An Introduction to Program Management Using a Case Study, covers the key management areas that will be covered throughout the book: plan management, risk management, and stakeholder management.
- Writing a goal to be too specific as to how a goal is achieved carries its own risks, so it is best to strike a balance between adaptability and setting a clear intent for the program.
- good communication is what separates average practitioners from exemplary practitioners.
- There are two aspects to setting up a good communication plan: defining the types of communication you need and discovering who your stakeholders are.
- I prefer to do a first draft myself and then collaborate with the development teams to get us on the same page, but collaborating from the start is perfectly reasonable as well. I do it this way to reduce the amount of time I’m taking from the development team and I find that people are more productive when they have a document to assess as opposed to creating something from scratch.
- The monthly review is directed toward stakeholders that are directly involved in the project or program (as in, they have resourcing involved), and upper management teams. The content is focused on the direction of the project or program including major milestones and their statuses. This will include any major issues or blockers that are directly impacting a major milestone but not the lower-level details such as standup and minor development blockers.
- Chapter 5, Driving Toward Clarity, elaborates on the recurring trait that defines everything a TPM does: being clarity-driven.
- The result of looking at the program as a combination of existing projects compared to a goal split into projects can change the nature of the goal to ensure alignment and understanding, though the end state will be the same.
- Risk management includes both risk analysis and strategies to handle the risks that feed into the initial project plan and form a continuous feedback loop. As a risk arises, a schedule may need to be adjusted, and changes to the plan can introduce new risks to add to the risk register.
- Stakeholder management is the art of managing expectations. Each stakeholder has a different set of needs for the project, and their point of view is based on their personal experiences as well as their expectations for the project. The communication plan helps you draft ways to communicate across the entire span of needs of your stakeholders. Knowing how to communicate effectively is the key to driving clarity to (and with) your stakeholders.
- During planning, the TPM relies on their technical background to clarify ambiguity in requirements and to ensure they can transform them into a functional specification (functional spec), which is a document mapping business requirements to functionality (APIs, user actions, and features). In turn, the functional spec relies on the TPM’s technical background and system knowledge to trace the system functionality back to the requirements.
- Most importantly, the overall tone and narrative should focus on the aspects that have direct business value or impact. The business stakeholders are interested in understanding the value their involvement is bringing to the program.
### Risk Management
- Chapter 11, The Technical Toolset, is all about the three fundamental tools in a TPM’s technical toolset: programming fundamentals, system design, and architectural design.
- The reason that a program exists is to facilitate multiple projects in achieving a common set of goals. The most important step for a program is to define that set of goals.
- The same is true for resource management—if you lose or gain resources, your project plan will need to be adjusted. The available resources also play heavily into your initial timelines.
- As with any specialty, there is a balance between where the specialization enhances their ability to be effective and when the specialization is too specific to allow the practitioner to thrive.
- Lastly, the quarterly review is directed toward senior leadership and executive sponsors for the project or program. Here, the content closely matches that of the monthly review but with a quarterly cycle. Some details may be taken out if deemed too granular, as the concern at this level is about the overall health and the end goal’s trajectory. The executive sponsor wants to know if the end goal that they sponsored is on track, including any expected return on investment or incremental improvements or value added.
- The reason that a program exists is to facilitate multiple projects in achieving a common set of goals. The most important step for a program is to define that set of goals.
- If a risk is realized and acted upon, or a new risk is introduced through a shift in the plan or other circumstances, this will be communicated to your stakeholders.
- As you can see, just as we would look for and analyze cross-task risks at the project level, we’d do the same at the program level. Each of these risks may be tracked at the project level but should also be monitored at the program level.
### Driving Toward Clarity
- In the 1967 book The Technical Program Manager’s Guide to Survival, by Melvin Silverman, the author defines a program as an organization created to accomplish a specific goal. This organization was a group within a company that existed for the sole purpose of achieving the program goals, and it was to be dissolved once the goal was realized.
- The reason that a program exists is to facilitate multiple projects in achieving a common set of goals. The most important step for a program is to define that set of goals.
- At the beginning of a project, the SDLC starts with the requirements analysis phase. The requirements may already be well defined and only need to be analyzed and broken down into a plan, or they may be newly discovered or added requirements to an existing project that need to be incorporated into the existing project plan. The analysis includes understanding prerequisite work, resource needs, and timing needs, as well as identifying known risks that need to be added to the project risk register.
- When planning the project composition of a program, one aspect to look at is how the project structures can create risk. Cross-project dependencies require a higher amount of coordination than task dependencies within a project.
- Regardless of the language type, you should know enough about the language to read through the code and have a basic grasp of what it is doing.
- It is the reason why you will hear the Technical Program Manager (TPM) in the room ask why and how. It’s why you see TPMs run meeting after meeting, working session after working session, and attending every standup that they can fit into their schedule. They are constantly taking the information they have and clarifying it so that it has no ambiguity left and is easier to understand and follow.
- This first definition is where the term seems to have originated. When a program manager had specific knowledge in the domain they were managing, they were seen as technical program managers. There it was!
- This brings up an interesting concept of a project existing within multiple programs. If project management tools are to be believed, this should not be allowed, but there is value in allowing overlap as the overlap highlights different aspects of that project’s goals and helps ensure the wider organization is moving together in the same direction while ensuring singular goals are also achieved. In a sense, this overlap is natural and feeds into the TPM’s ability to see both the forest and the trees without getting stuck in one or the other.
- Once these requirements are better understood and incorporated into the project plan, the design phase is started, which takes the requirements and builds a design that meets the requirements. This may require more than one design, depending on the scope of the requirements.
- The risk still exists, especially when collaborating with a team you are unfamiliar with, as there is always a storming phase where the different groups are working out how to best communicate with each other.
- Being able to read a method and see what it does instead of finding a developer to explain it can be a valuable time-saver and will give you the chance to understand your services at a deeper level.
- Driving towards clarity leads to consensus because, without clarity, you can’t move past getting everyone onto the same page, and you can’t continue on to driving consensus.
- a program comprises multiple related projects. A project manager may run more than one project at a time, but they may not have a common goal. A program manager runs multiple projects that share a common goal and possibly multiple programs too.
- Without the program, the projects would have been successful on their own, but the program brings cohesion and purpose to the group of projects and helps uncover value that wasn’t obvious on the surface. The program also highlights gaps in the goals for the individual projects where they believed they were holistically solving a customer experience problem; they were only solving it in a single dimension.
- The design then drives the implementation of the actual requirement. As stated, this may end up being multiple implementations across services or components and involve several resources to be completed. The actual implementation may differ from what was planned, based on unforeseen issues that may impact the test plan, in which case, it can be updated during or after implementation is complete.
- There are no inherent risks to this stage, though it should include risk analysis while prioritizing which feedback to act upon in the next cycle. This would be a form of high-level analysis; for instance, the feedback may be a good idea but still somewhat vague. This can cause scope creep during the requirements and design phases if the requirement isn’t sufficiently clear enough to transform into requirements.
- As you can see, adapters act as a type of bridge between the internal systems and the needs of the external systems.
- Everyone drives toward clarity in some aspect of their life. It is the act of taking knowledge and applying it to a situation to make the path forward better understood, and to lead to the desired outcome.
- Project planning is where we work through requirements, resourcing, and constraints and develop an action plan.
- I did an exercise where I combined the requirements across the projects to see how they would align together. This showed that a common goal existed across the requirements, which also led to realizing that one of our unfunded projects fit into the program as well. Not only that – it was essential for the end goal that these individual projects were attempting to achieve.
- The implementation then leads to testing. This step will likely involve multiple types of testing – from integration testing, ensuring that the introduction of code functionally works, to regression testing, which focuses on ensuring no bugs were introduced that changed existing behavior, and possibly some form of production testing if the use case and project warrant this approach.
- The testing phase is where a lot of the unknown unknowns cause issues. These can be problems that only robust testing was able to find, usually in edge cases for your software or service.

Highlights 
### System Design and Architecture Landscape
- What makes a TPM shine is that they drive toward clarity in every aspect of their job. We question everything and everyone to ensure that the objective is as clear as it can be. In this respect, a TPM must be willing to question requirements from upper management just as deftly as from a leader of a peer team.
- TPMs are adept at looking at the bigger picture and piecing together when one project may impact another.
- The final phase is evaluation, or iteration. This step involves examining a product and looking for improvements. These improvements can also come from feedback from stakeholders and customers.
- Regardless of how prepared you are for this process, it is an unknown that is out of your direct control—the InfoSec analysis may find an issue your team didn’t foresee and delay the process further than planned. Treat this as you would working with a vendor; there are parts of this process for which you are relying on another team and they might have fewer reviewers than they typically would or other reviews that are taking longer than expected.
- As we grow, we start looking at the architectural landscape that surrounds our projects and programs to see patterns of opportunity and areas of risk. We start to influence the teams around us and the organization as a whole.
- As you can see, the entry-level position’s problem statement and the solution are clearly defined, much like the first retail example. Both the problem and solution are laid out. There will be some minor ambiguities during execution that you’ll need to resolve, but it will be fairly straightforward. At this level, you are focusing on executing a solution and expanding your project and program management skill set.
- So, the combination of what to deliver to meet the program goal requirements and the organizational structure of the company helps form the decision to build a program. Each company has its own organizational structure, so whether or not a program makes sense for you depends on your company as well as the requirements you are working with. The only hard and fast rule for when a program should exist comes down to when multiple projects are needed to get the requirements met.
- In some cases, customer outreach may have its own cycle that is independent of the project.
- During standups, I often talk about the concept of a task being done, done, done. In that, I mean that a task, or bit of code, is not truly done until the code is written (first done), it is reviewed and approved (second done), and finally, the code has made its way to the production fleet and been tested (the final done).
- As a TPM, you split your time between the high-level scope, which spans multiple systems, and the weeds of a specific feature design.
- Moving on to the industry TPM, there’s a little less direction. You might be told the general solution but not how to accomplish it, so it is slightly more ambiguous than earlier. A senior TPM will simply be told what problem to solve but not how. In this scenario, the focus on driving toward clarity comes from the solution so your focus is on the right design and project plan to execute.
- As there is more than one project, a program is also needed to ensure that these projects keep the program goal in focus, as well as facilitate cross-project collaboration.
- For a TPM to thrive, their focus needs to be on moving the project forward and unblocking their team to get things done.
- Track your buffer and constantly rebase your plan as the buffer is taken up. Rebasing doesn’t mean you automatically shift your dates, but it gives you an idea of the current trajectory, which will help you decide on the best course of action. Dates may need to be adjusted or milestones crashed if the buffer is insufficient
- The model is the data model of the application. All the data manipulation and storage happen in this layer.
  The view is the user interface at the top of the diagram. This displays all of the data in the application in ways that make sense to the user.
  The presenter sits in between the model and view and acts as the connecting layer between them. The user interacts with the presenter, usually through input fields in the view such as text boxes and buttons, which trigger events. The events live in the presenter and make changes in the model based on the event that occurred.
- Beyond these levels, we get into high-impact positions where the ambiguity increases significantly. This can vary depending on your experience and the company but, generally, lands between being told that a problem may exist and to investigate and fix it, and to go find problems and fix them. In the first example, the problem statement is very ambiguous but, in the latter, the problem statement isn’t ambiguous, it’s non-existent!
- Though these would have been treated as features in a single project, the stakeholders were different for each operating system, and thus the impact on these stakeholders rarely overlapped. These impact cues are what helped us decide that creating multiple projects is the right way forward.
- Our innate drive to solve roadblocks, build a plan, mitigate risk, and drive toward deadlines are key to a project’s success.
- Lastly, doing a working session with stakeholders to talk through requirements as a single pass can provide a lot of value in a short amount of time. Build in time during the session to identify, analyze, and plan the risk strategies; then, you can update the overall project plan for cases where avoidance was the best strategy to follow.
- So, while OOA can be good for getting your application out the door fast, you pay for it in the end with the high cost of maintenance any time large changes are needed.
- This iteration of the high-level design demonstrates how the planning cycles for the program and project can influence each other, and how driving clarity can feed right back into additional planning.
- Once a set of requirements is broken out into more than one project, a program is needed to ensure the full requirements are met.
- It is in our best interests to resolve issues quickly in order to keep engagement, focus, and motivation.
- The ability to see multiple strategies for a risk is a key quality I look for during interviews. TPMs should be able to use every strategy at their disposal to solve a problem.
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a concept where domain experts work alongside the development team to influence the data model and data flow of an application. This is used in domain-heavy scenarios such as healthcare and financial systems where specific procedures, nomenclature, and protocols need to be followed.
- Communication is key to our success. So is our ability to connect the problem with the right people to solve it, and to find out how problems may intersect.
- You are looking for deliverable chunks of requirements like a specific feature or function – much like determining features in a project.
  When examining requirements, look for scope and impact cues that may serve as logical delineations between multiple projects to deliver on the requirements you have.
- This driving motivation is a trait that isn’t always present in roles that are adjacent to the TPM, such as the development manager and the product manager. This is because the primary function of those roles is not focused on project or program delivery like the TPM role is. A development manager’s main focus is their people and their service or area of ownership, and a product manager’s focus is their product.
    - Note: I don't think this is true at a startup. Which may be why I'm having to dig to find the true value of the role in a startup.
- The risk score correlates to the amount of attention a particular risk may warrant from you. If the risk score is low, then either the impact or probability (or both) is low, and not much attention is needed to keep track of it. However, for a high-risk score, the impact is either high or it is almost inevitable that the risk will be realized, meaning that you will need to be ready to act upon your strategies and likely need to watch the risk closely.
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is where the application’s data model is updated through user-triggered and system events, which often signal to change something about the data model state.
- If you think of your stakeholders as partners and resources of information instead of people to send reports to, you can create immensely powerful relationships to help propel your project forward, or at least keep it on track.
- Projects can be done standalone and do not need to be part of a larger program. In many industries, this is how almost all work is done: through independent and discrete projects.
- One of the most effective ways to keep forward momentum is to always drive toward clarity.
- The reason for a sum is to remove any unconscious bias you may have in assessing the risk score. It’s easier to be honest about two discrete scores of how likely something is to happen, and then separately ask what the impact of a risk would be. Then the final risk is a sum of the two direct scores.
- Above all of these individual design considerations and patterns, you’ll want to ensure that the design you have created is defendable. There is more than one way to solve a problem and a system design is no exception to that rule. As such, you need to understand the choices you have made in the design and why you made them.
- The status update mechanism is used when you are keeping your stakeholders up to date with current progress. Though this may seem like a passive exercise, it can help stakeholder teams prepare for milestone deliveries and reduce back-and-forth churn. It is also an indirect way to receive feedback from your stakeholders.
- As a TPM, one of your jobs will be deciding when a program needs to be created and whether it is appropriate to the needs of your organization to do so.
- We are always driving towards clarity through clarifying requirements, clarifying scope, clarifying the communication strategies and important stakeholders, and even unblocking development work.
- I use the same three-tier scale across both impact and probability, as well as the resulting score. I have found that a four- or five-tiered scale is too nuanced and can lead to nitpicking the analysis of the probability and impact. The difference between High and Very High is just too subjective. In contrast, the jump from Low to Medium or Medium to High is a bit more abrupt when your scale only allows for three levels, and the clarity of whether something is one of two things is easier to classify than whether something is Medium, High, or Very High.
- You can always be taught new ways of solving problems, so the goal here is more to demonstrate that you can think critically and adjust as new data comes in that may impact your design considerations.
- In issue resolution, you are communicating in order to get additional input to help solve the issue. This is important because each stakeholder will have a different perspective on the issue and may be able to provide useful information to drive a solution.
- To understand how to define the boundaries within a program, let’s first talk about how we set the boundaries within a project. At this level, it’s fairly straightforward – we define milestones and features.
- Every roadblock we encounter requires us to drive toward clarity. We ask about the problem, the people or systems involved, any proposed solutions, and paths to escalation. Then, we take all of this data and define the problem to ensure that our solution is fixing the right thing
- The scorecard helps you identify the risk score or severity of a risk on a fixed scale. The higher the risk, the more closely it must be tracked, as it will likely cause some level of issue.
- If you are already a TPM, then you will often review designs from your development team and can use these concepts to ensure that the design holds up to scrutiny.
- The mere act of talking with others outside your sphere of knowledge or influence can garner valuable information and challenge assumptions you may not realize you had in the first place.
- Defining the boundaries of a project or program can help ensure scope creep is monitored and addressed and that the designs that fit the requirements stay within the bounds of the project. This also helps you see which projects should be part of a particular program. Without a clear boundary, a program can stray from its purpose.
- We understand the business and their needs, and if required, we understand their knowledge domain. Knowing the domain isn’t always required to land a job, but the ability to learn the domain on the job is key to being a successful TPM.
- Keeping a risk register reduces the chance of forgetting about a risk and, often, the written risk will trigger the memory for you in the moment.
- You can’t see the forest for the trees is a proverb that was first published in 1546 in The Proverbs of John Heywood.
- For highly ambiguous problems or solutions, the adage of “building the plane while flying” often leads to discovering requirements and stakeholders as the program is being executed.
- risk assessment and management at the program level is about a difference in perspective. The program will focus on cross-project dependencies and the risks involved, whereas the project will focus on cross-task dependencies, as well as risks associated with a given task itself.
- By understanding our business and its needs, as well as our development team’s needs, we can effectively bridge the communication gap between business and technology.
- The brain is great at forgetting things that are no longer useful, and switching to a different team or company is a quick way to forget previous projects and day-to-day nuance from the previous team.
- I offer a slightly different version of this proverb as a directive to all TPMs:
  You must see the forest as well as the trees.
  A TPM must have both breadth and depth of knowledge. The depth (or the trees) refers to system designs and the breadth refers to the architectural landscape (or the forest).
- stakeholders can change through the life of a program and will constantly need to be reassessed.
  New requirements may lead to new teams getting involved in a program and will bring along new stakeholders, or a stakeholder might leave the company, prompting a new stakeholder to represent the vacant space.
- At the program level, we need to examine how a project’s deliverables may overlap with another project’s deliverables. These intersections will always include some risk.
- To improve this skill, ensure that you practice active listening by staying engaged with the speaker (put your phone away and stop checking email). Affirm your understanding through body language such as nodding — but don’t interrupt. When they are finished, paraphrase what you heard and follow up with questions.
- From personal experience, I can say that relying on your own memory to think of risks can only work for so long. Human memory requires stimulation to keep thoughts fresh enough to call upon, and as you add in more and more project experience, the ability to recall specific instances gets harder and harder.
- Important tools we use to see the bigger picture better (the forest) are program, product, and team roadmaps. These roadmaps encompass different components of an architectural landscape. Each one looks into the future deliverables of a group of systems. More importantly, they describe either directly or indirectly the intention of that group of systems, why they exist, and what they are striving to become. The intentions, as well as discrete deliverables, are what determine the picture of the architectural landscape both as it exists today and how it will change in the future.
- We think of stakeholders as people or groups we need to communicate statuses to discuss timelines and blockers with, and so on, and while this is true, they are also great sources of information throughout the project, especially when the requirements or solution is ambiguous.
- For cross-project dependencies such as these, the TPM running the program would own the risk and ensure that the risk strategies are followed within the impacted projects. The project lead for the subsystem will also have a stake in the cross-project dependencies and should work closely with all project leaders.
- When you interrupt, you aren’t taking in what the other person is saying because you are looking for a space in the conversation to insert your own thoughts, instead of taking in what the other person is saying. Active listening will ensure that you truly understand the point of view of the other person. Often, this information can build on your understanding of their problem.
- Any changes to strategies, closed risks, or newly added risks should be well documented in the project risk log and status updates, and in the company’s risk register upon project closure. Documentation is how you build institutional memory that others can rely on in future projects, including yourself!
- A TPM will be expected to pick up on these cues from roadmaps and directives and point out when there’s an issue or an opportunity between multiple projects or programs. A principal TPM is expected to see these issues or opportunities without being prompted, whereas a senior TPM is expected to see these connections as they relate to the projects or programs they run.
- Without constant risk assessment, your carefully crafted project plan can quickly become useless as risk after risk causes constant shifts in the plan. This goes against the nature of a plan and negates the hard work of planning in the first place.
- This additional overhead of a program coordinating across projects adds risks related to dependency delays and longer design times to allow for syncing across teams.
- The better you understand the pains of your business team, the better you can relay that to your development team in your functional specifications and conversations about scope. The more your development teams understand, the better the outcome of the software, and the more successful a project will be.
- When analyzing the risk and planning for it, you need to include some way of measuring or controlling the risk. Essentially, you need a way to see the risk materializing ahead of time so you can act as quickly as possible.
- In the preceding figure, each column of boxes represents the services owned by a single SDM. These services are the purview of our SDM, and they are expected to understand each one in its entirety, as well as how they interact with each other. It’s often necessary for our SDM to know about the services outside of their team that have a relationship with one or more of their own services.
- A misunderstood risk can create a false sense of security by providing a risk strategy that may not fully address the problem.
- The role of the program TPM is to set the projects up for success. They are there to ensure that each project TPM understands the role of their project in relation to the program. As a project TPM, they should already understand the goal of their project but may not realize how it fits into the larger picture of the program.
- The TPM and PM-T are often involved in prioritization exercises and where a product is concerned, a TPM can handle that if needed, but a PM-T will be more nuanced. The main focus of the PM-T is on the product roadmap and strategy, instead of projects or programs
- Risk tracking is cyclical and can lead to re-analyzing, identifying, and planning on the fly as circumstances change in the project.
- The smallest inner circle is an entry-level SDE who is mainly concerned with a single service. An industry SDE will need to stretch to related services, often under the same SDM that they report to. They know how these services work and how they interact with one another and are starting to learn about outside dependencies. The largest circle is the senior SDE who needs to know about all services under their SDM, as well as the services that have a relationship with them from other teams.
- The service could have a great month and not miss a single deployment, but that doesn’t mean the risk is gone. This deployment risk isn’t meant as a slight to the team that owns the service but is just a statement of fact, and if I ignore that fact, I put the project in jeopardy.
- Once a program is created, either at the beginning along with the associated projects or in flight, a kickoff meeting is needed. This meeting is where all stakeholders come together to discuss the program and its goals, as well as the role each stakeholder will play in the management of the program.
- If a project goes beyond its domain boundary or is a cross-team program, a TPM is better equipped to handle that level of complexity.
- So, it is important to look at each risk and see all the different strategies that you might be able to employ and how they may fall back on one another.
    - Tags: [[c2]] 
- An entry-level TPM starts out with the same expectations as an industry SDE in that they need to know the complete architecture of their SDM (also known as an embedded TPM) or the services they are focused on. An industry TPM is expected to know about the dependent systems of their focus area as the initiatives going on in that space. Lastly, a senior TPM is expected to understand the architecture of their organization—not necessarily to the same level of detail as with the services they focus on, but at least the high-level data flow and interactions.
- We aren’t in a textbook world, though, and in the real world, many unforeseen problems can crop up and need to be handled when they come up. These are unknown variables and should go into your risk register to reduce the chances of the same problem coming up again in future projects.
- The kickoff sets the stage to ensure that everyone is aware of the end goal of the program and not just their respective project goals. Each project lead gets an idea of how their project may impact other projects in the program and each stakeholder has a chance to raise concerns and point out potential new stakeholders.
- Figure 1.6: A Venn diagram comparing the TPM, SDM, and PM-T roles
- Each risk can have multiple strategies.
    - Tags: [[c1]] 
- A system design is limited in scope, as it often covers a single feature or limited data flow between highly related systems. The design may dive into API definitions, as well as illustrate the data model and how it flows through the system.
- However, a risk is something that might happen and impact the project timeline, scope, or resourcing, but hasn’t happened yet. It’s a known variability to your project plan.
- The leadership sync should flow very similarly to a sprint stand-up. This means going round-robin from TPM to TPM to get a quick status on each project, including any blockers or concerns. This continues the theme of the kickoff by not only informing you as the program TPM of the current status but also ensuring all project TPMs are aware of what each other is doing.
- The size of the team is also a factor in the relevancy of both the TPM and PM-T roles. A PM-T isn’t necessarily needed for a small team with a single service, but as the team grows and a product becomes complex, or begins to serve many diverse types of clients, a PM-T should be brought on board. The same applies to a TPM—once the number of stakeholders becomes too large and complex, it begins to fall out of the expected comfort zone for an SDM, and a TPM should be hired.
- Acceptance: This is an option when there is no way to avoid, mitigate, or transfer the risk. Sometimes, the project will just need to take the hit and adjust timelines to compensate. In some cases, there may be ways to avoid, mitigate, or transfer, but the cost to do so is greater than the impact the risk will have on the project. Sometimes, failure is the best course of action.
- An architectural diagram usually covers high-level system interactions and multiple systems and features that share a common theme. APIs and data field flows are less relevant at the level of the architectural landscape.
- In these examples, ambiguity in the requirements forces the late discovery of missed scoping during design and development. Ensuring that the project requirements are well understood and written in detail can mitigate these problems.
- If a new major issue surfaces, address it after the round-robin is complete so those not impacted may leave. This concept, known as the parking lot, is also used in sprint standups to ensure the efficient use of everyone’s time.
- Some companies are shifting to product managers instead of TPMs, while others are doing the opposite and migrating toward TPMs. On a small scale, this swap is easy, and the gaps can be filled with minor inconvenience to a team. However, as the team scales, both roles become necessary.
- Transference: This is where you transfer the risk to another group. This may sound cruel or even lazy, but it might make the most sense depending on the risk.
- Describing a system that you know well: This often entails you describing a system you are currently working with or have deep knowledge of from a previous project or job. The goal here is to see how well you know a system in real life as this helps them understand the depth of your system knowledge. This is my favorite version of the question because it brings passion to the discussion, as the interviewee gets to talk about something they know a lot about.
- Change management, which is the process used to handle a change in scope, resourcing, or timelines, is negatively impacted by scope creep, as it causes constant churn on the project plan. This leads to delayed delivery of a milestone or the delay of the entire project. Though the nature of the project management triangle is that these elements are always tied to one another, a well-defined plan will reduce the friction between them.
- The roles at the program level are usually fewer than at the project level as there isn’t as much day-to-day work involved in tracking a program.
- The short answer is that we do it all. Our job is to ensure that our programs and projects are successful, and that may require different skills depending on the context of what is going on.
- The result of the realized risk causes you to introduce a countermeasure to soften the impact. This strategy is reactionary in nature but is also a good balance for some companies between over-preparing for the unknown and not planning at all. This may also be a good choice when the probability is relatively low.
- Ensure you know why design choices were made: Whether you are explaining a new feature or an existing system, you need to know why a design choice was made.
- There is an element of exploration to determine the right path forward, and this is not the same concept as scope creep.
- As the program SLR builds on the project status reports, ensuring that every status report is on time and that the schedule of reports is set up properly falls on the program TPM.
- As a refresher, a program is a group of resources brought together to achieve a specific goal. Once that goal is met, the program is over, which means it is a temporary endeavor.
- Mitigation: This is when you allow the risk to happen—or it just does—and you minimize the impact that the risk has.
- Understand the use cases for the system: This leans on the product side of our job but is also highly relevant to requirements analysis and planning. You must know why your system is doing what it is doing by understanding the user base, the expected traffic patterns, the availability of the service, and the data it contains, among other things.
- This discussion on scope creep can make it sound as though iterative development is fraught with scope creep, but it isn’t necessarily. The key differentiator here is that the unknown and exploratory nature of iterative development is planned for in those environments. The expected output of a sprint is one part finished work, and another part reflection on what is next.
- The program TPM is accountable for everything in the program, and this is especially true for project risks that impact the program. If a risk is close to being realized, thus has a high-risk score, or a risk has already been realized and risk strategies are underway, closer involvement of the program TPM is warranted.
- A product serves a specific purpose for a group of users. In this way, it is longer lasting, and although it may go through iterations, if it is successful, the intention is for it to be around for a long time.
- Avoidance: This is when you create a plan to avoid the risk.

### Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence in Technical Program Management
- Lastly, there are derived requirements, where the TPM gives the requirements or functional specifications to the development team, who then add additional requirements based on the needs of their service. This could be things such as scaling, latency, or code refactoring that are needed to make the required changes maintainable. As a TPM, the more you know about the roadmaps, architectural evolutions, and availability needs of the services you work with, the more you can anticipate these needs earlier on so they are not added during development but added into the scope at the beginning.
- Attending project-level standups to understand the day-to-day or even hour-by-hour concerns will reduce communication times and allow the program TPM to coordinate cross-projects faster if the need arises.
- For a small organization that has a single product, product management is likely more important to their success, as most of their work will revolve around a product development life cycle—very similar to the SDLC—as an iterative approach to releasing new versions of their product. So release management, roadmap prioritization based on customer feedback, and market analysis are of the highest value.
- During analysis, you might decide to add project tasks to dive deeper into the risk to understand it more.
- I have instituted a policy I hold myself to, which is to ask the GenAI tool for the sources it used to generate the answer. I then go and read those sources to ensure they match. In most cases, I’ll use the cited source instead of GenAI’s output, which I essentially treat as a search mechanism.
- Conversely, scope creep can happen through gold plating, or the addition of features or enhancements not asked for in the requirements.
- Intervention should rarely be a case of taking control, but rather offering a lending hand to resolve the issue more rapidly, help identify cross-project impacts, and ensure good communication with all impacted stakeholders. If cross-project communication is not required, or the issue isn’t being reported at the program level, intervention is not required.
- You still have a focus on product management for each product that you own, but a new complexity has been introduced, which is cross-product or cross-organization collaboration. Let’s say a new feature that is common to the platform is introduced, like the ability to copy and paste information between products. Who would own this? One of the many product managers, on top of owning their release cycle? Instead, this is where a TPM becomes valuable for this type of organization.
- In the absence of a risk register, or in combination with it, working with your stakeholders and project team to discuss potential risks is a good approach as well. The more experience you have to draw upon, the easier it is to identify risks and solve complex issues. Every program that I have run in the last 6 years or so has started with a kickoff meeting with all stakeholders. This is a standardized process in most process management styles, including PMP. The reason for this is because of the valuable information you get from collaborating early on with everyone involved in the project or program.
- Another area where ChatGPT can be useful is to provide insights into your current plan. Maybe there are optimizations that can be done to bring in timelines or reduce risk on a dependency-heavy chain of work. Asking for insights on a plan can be another way to run a risk analysis, sort of like asking a co-worker for their perspective.
- Scope creep, or the increase in scope unexpectedly, can arise in a few different scenarios. We think of it mostly as additional requests that are added to the project after the scope is locked in, and this certainly does happen. However, it also occurs when requirements are not well understood. As requirements are fleshed out, they uncover complexities not seen at first, which will lead to additional tasks to meet the requirements. This is due to a lack of sufficient clarity in the requirements, resulting in poor estimations and understanding.
- is the set of requirements, and the impact is the group of people affected by the scope.
- coordination can be handled by the development manager, but it may also require a TPM if the number of organizations involved becomes large.
- Once you have identified, analyzed, and planned for risks, you need to track them.
- If your company has access to a locked-down GenAI that is trained on company data, then that system would be an amazing asset for risk analysis as it is essentially a large risk log, even for incidents that weren’t called out as a specific risk. This is more powerful than an index or keyword search because it can look through all available data and find potential risks that could be hard to spot.
- To get to this list of affected systems, I iterated together with another Principal TPM to build the data flow diagram and thus determine how it would alter the data flow landscape.
- we learned that a program should be created when sufficient impact and scope dictate that multiple projects are needed to complete the goals. We also discussed how seeing patterns and goals across existing projects may align and warrant the creation of a program to track them as a whole.
- a good visualization of this is to think of a product as a vertical construct in your company. There’s a business team and a development team attached to that product. Anything that impacts that product alone can be done within the confines of a product manager.
- You could do this in the opposite order, finding stakeholders and then defining your plan, but I prefer the consistency of a communication template. It ensures that, from project to project, your communication approach and formatting, styles, and cadences are consistent, with only minor changes based on individual circumstances.
- Write first, and optimize second
  To ensure what you are writing is your own and isn’t detectable as AI-generated, I recommend always writing the first draft yourself. Whether it’s an email, status report, or other broad communication, this will ensure your tone is present and that the factual details are all present as well. Generative AI is just that—it generates text and without grounding facts, it may generate something that isn’t true.
  So, just as they say to measure twice and cut once in the carpentry world, in the TPM world, write first and optimize second!
- In the most recent program that I ran, the team needed to add new data entities that needed to be transmitted between 10 services, across 6 teams, and 2 Vice President (VP) organizations.
### Emotional Intelligence in Technical Program Management
- So, the more complex your ecosystem, the higher the likelihood that TPMs are needed to drive cross-organizational initiatives.
- Don’t be afraid to help out when the team needs it, but also don’t be afraid to push back when the value is no longer there for you to be running stand-ups.
    - Note: this is good advice for any activity that you may need no longer be adding value to you
- Our strength is in our emotional intelligence—our ability to connect with our stakeholders and team, and to control our emotions and affect those of others when needed. This isn’t an area AI is going to help you with. Therefore, I am focusing on mundane tasks where help from GenAI can accelerate your productivity and allow your creative energy to be focused on solving problems and unblocking your team.
### Plan Management
- A common method used is the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence test, which defines EQ in four areas and measures each one separately. These areas are your ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions.
- Due to this, their standards for project management are, as the interviewer put it, based on a “do what is needed” mentality. This is by no means bad, as many companies use this strategy to great success. There wasn’t much from the job boards that clued us in on this, but the focus on the SDLC does seem to agree with the bottom-up approach to management that the interviewee referenced, where the drive is from the engineering teams.
- For a red status, the PTG is often exploratory. Most paths look to understand the impact so that the right action can be determined, first focusing on scope and resourcing.
- Don’t be afraid to ask, and equally, don’t be afraid to pivot to a different source of truth when needed.
- A use case should tell a story about something a user should be able to do. You often see them written out as a story, such as this:
  As a user/admin/seller/customer, I can perform some action.
- For TPMs, EQ can help you adapt to a changing environment with controlled emotion and intent. To achieve this level of adaptability, there are four components you need to learn about and grow for yourself: self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills.
- An interesting takeaway in my discussions about Google is that they are heavily product-focused. A good portion—up to 30%—of the TPM’s schedule is dedicated to working with product managers on the product roadmap and backlog grooming based on it. The job descriptions hint at this as well, which discuss that Google is product-focused and how cross-team communication with engineers and product managers is a must.
- However, there are cases where the issue’s impact isn’t well understood and requires some investigation to determine the impact and the right path forward. Though this may seem ambiguous and warrant a red status, I find that, in these cases, yellow may be more appropriate. This is because it isn’t clear whether there is an impact to begin with or what the path forward would be. Saying you are red at this stage adds more certainty than is warranted based on what is known.
- If you are having trouble understanding your business teams’ needs, a quick chat with a GenAI tool can answer some questions about the basics of what your business team does and what challenges their business line might face.
- To provide context to the requirements and make it easier to test and validate, use cases are created that may span multiple requirements but tell a story on the behavior of the system. Each use case will trace back to the requirements that it will satisfy to ensure that all requirements are met.
- However, in order for your social skills to be effective, empathy and self-regulation are needed, and these all rely on self-awareness in order to identify, foster, and grow these habits.
- Amazon is also a “do what is needed” organization, where the TPM role can vary quite a bit from team to team, based on the gaps and needs of a team.
- For a yellow status, the PTG is often well understood with no ambiguity, which is why the project is yellow and not red. In these cases, there are open issues that introduce doubt about your deliverable dates but the options available are well understood and have a good chance of succeeding in bringing the project back on track.
- If you are having trouble understanding your business teams’ needs, a quick chat with a GenAI tool can answer some questions about the basics of what your business team does and what challenges their business line might face.
- I suggest that requirements analysis is not done in a closed room and that multiple stakeholders are involved, at least at some point, as they may see a gap that you do not.
- Before you can learn to regulate your emotions and use them to effectively communicate during change, you need to understand what emotions you have and what triggers them.
- More often than not, the TPM type of duties that would warrant an entry-level TPM can also be done by either the development manager or the software developer/engineer themselves.
- Both yellow and red statuses must have a path to green (PTG). This is the set of actions that need to take place in order to get a project back on track. Just as with every other action, these require an owner and a date.
- If you are having trouble understanding your business teams’ needs, a quick chat with a GenAI tool can answer some questions about the basics of what your business team does and what challenges their business line might face.
- Requirements gathering and refinement
  Building use cases from the requirements
  Task breakdown with estimates
  Assembling the project plan
- You need to be able to look at your actions, analyze them, and be constructive and honest with yourself. This is hard, as our natural instincts have us immediately close ourselves off to criticism. The bonus here is that the better you become at being self-critical, the better you can help others with feedback and growth, as empathy will be a natural consequence of your own self-improvement.
### Pillars of a Technical Program Manager
- if a risk was successfully mitigated and didn’t impact your ability to deliver, then the status can stay green (or whatever status you are on, as it does not shift the status).

### Pillars of a Technical Program Manager
- if a risk was successfully mitigated and didn’t impact your ability to deliver, then the status can stay green (or whatever status you are on, as it does not shift the status).
### Enhancing Management Using Your Technical Toolset
- Requirements gathering and refinement
  Building use cases from the requirements
  Task breakdown with estimates
  Assembling the project plan
- The key is understanding what actions trigger the positive and negative emotions to help you better understand them.
- You cannot have the skills to run a program without also having the skills to run a project. However, the reverse is not true—you can certainly have project management skills and not have the skills to run a program.
- As a TPM, my preference is always transparency on status, even when it makes you or another stakeholder look bad. It’s better to be honest and upfront than to sow distrust by reporting a watermelon status (green on the outside, but red on the inside)!
- A TPM is an extension of a program manager and, as such, it shares the trait of driving toward clarity. However, our technical toolset allows us to use specialized tools to tackle technical problems that would leave a non-technical PM struggling to process them.
- We know the work that needs to be done and so does everyone else. The team spends less time on determining what and when and instead focuses on how to achieve the tasks and goals. Driving clarity in requirements early on takes less time than correcting the issue later in execution as this can lead to bad estimations due to poor understanding, which results in longer timelines.
- Although we often think of meditation as involving longer sessions, meditating for just 5 minutes has been shown to help reduce stress and allow us to focus more easily.
- emotional intelligence. While GenAI will steadily reduce many of the functional and administrative tasks like risk assessment, document generation, and even project planning, it will not replace our soft skills. This is our ability to interact with others, act on our intuition, and use empathy to help connect with stakeholders and make the right decisions for our programs.
- Red
  A red status means there is no current way to meet the scheduled delivery with the current resourcing and defined work. This is the status that I’ve seen the most contention in its definition in my career. If a project, left unchanged, cannot meet the due date, it is red. This does not mean that the date is impossible to meet but there is no ambiguity at this point in the project that something must change.
- For each of these deliverables, you can take a look at where the feature will need to be added to the code to make sure the feature makes sense to the code structure—this is where being able to read and understand code is really valuable in this stage. ... Over time, this will take less and less of your time as you’ll be familiar with the structure of the services you are working with and won’t need to actually reference the code too often.
- From project initiation, all the way through to project closing, the TPM is clarifying requirements, assumptions, issues, plans, and estimates to continually steer the project in the right direction.
- However, in this exercise, we are trying to look at our own actions, so look at the situation from a bystander’s perspective.
  How do you perceive your own actions from this perspective? Do they come across differently than they do from your own internal perspective?
- This isn’t to say that time can’t be reduced, or resourcing won’t be tight, but this does mean that something must give and that is usually the quality.
- Projects that run hot and fast often don’t have proper time to plan for everything and issues will constantly crop up.
- I have found that being direct in my intention smooths out any pushback as they understand I’m helping them succeed in the end. If you are open about why you are asking, they may start to supply that information ahead of time
- The best way to build empathy is to spend time with others. Our mind naturally mirrors other people that we are with, and mirroring builds stronger empathy. This can be hard for some people, including me, who are naturally introverts.
- A common scenario that requires adjusting the triangle comes when people are moved off of the project. In this case, either the project timelines must move out to accommodate the reduction in resources, or the scope must shrink, or a little of both scenarios.
- Ideally, the yellow status will be short-lived as risks have defined strategies to deal with them.
  Life does happen, and things come up, but keep this ideal state in mind so that when unexpected issues come up, you can have a retrospective to see whether they could have been anticipated, and then add them to your risk register for future projects.
- The more you know about the code base that your developers use and the more you understand the programming language, the more you can begin to intuit the effort it would take to implement the solutions you identified during requirements analysis and start to lay out your project plan.
- One easy way to remove tension is to add these questions to the sprint task template. Ensure the template has them fill out what the task is, what requirement it is meeting, and how they are going to do it.
- Self-regulation is the ability to pause between an emotion and a reaction. Highly reactive responses can lead to behaviors that are against our core values, as we don’t take time to evaluate the emotion before acting.
- Another frequent usage occurs when there is additional scope added to the project, either through a proper change request or simple scope creep, where features are added without going through a change process. In both cases, the outcome is the same: the constraints of the triangle have shifted to an unbalanced state and must be adjusted. In this example, a scope increase would necessitate increasing the time allowance for the project, adding additional resources, or a combination of both.
- Yellow/amber
  For a yellow (or amber in some countries) status, there are active issues that may impact the ability to deliver on schedule. It is not definite that the date will be missed at this stage, but it requires changes to get back on track.
  There is ambiguity still – it is a cautionary status and lets your stakeholders know that you are on top of the situation and being proactive to keep the project from going red.
- I always ensure my functional specifications and estimates are reviewed by the technical teams involved prior to work starting or even prior to communicating anything about the schedule. Your technical team members are the subject matter experts and should be consulted.
- You will need to go deep into the project and understand how these tasks are connected, the technologies behind them, and the people involved in order to bring the highest clarity to the project plan and ensure the success of the developer in their task. All of these questions reach out beyond the task itself to consider outside factors.
- We know our emotions and what triggers them, and now we need to control our impulses. Anticipate your emotional response based on the triggers you identified, and preempt the response to give yourself time to pause before acting.
- Without a plan, the project is doomed to failure, leading to reactive actions instead of proactive delivery. It can reveal poor planning or estimations, a project trending yellow as time slips, or a risk rising in probability. It is a living document guiding our path and the decisions needed to reach our goals.
- Green
  The project is meeting current milestones and deliverables and is on track to deliver on schedule. Some companies may need to include on budget in this status. So long as the currently agreed upon resourcing and scoping can get the project to the scheduled date, I consider it green.
- Watching for patterns across projects is a key part of a TPM’s long-term strategy planning.
- Here are some questions to ask or think about when assessing a design and estimation:
  Are there deployment issues or blockers on the team release calendar?
  What is the experience level of the developer for the area the task impacts?
  Are there any unknowns or new technologies for this task that may take extra time?
  Are there other projects ongoing that may impact the changes being made?
- Controlling your impulse and redirecting your response also builds your adaptability to change.
- Although this sounds straightforward, a project can very quickly stall if the right people and assets are not available when needed.
- DEFINE YOUR TRAFFIC LIGHT AND STICK TO IT
- I have had some assignments where I was the owner of the high-level design and consulted technical teams in the design. In other assignments, I wasn’t involved in the designs until the review stage where I ensured the design met the requirements of the project. I usually fall somewhere in between.
- I always clarify task estimations with the developer by asking how confident they are in the estimate. I follow up by asking what elements were included in the estimate (design, code review, testing, and/or deployment), as many new developers will just include the code writing itself. Lastly, I follow up by asking questions about the design to see what sort of responses I’m getting. This can help inform me of how big a buffer I might need to use for the developer’s estimates.
- Empathy is the ability to understand the feelings of someone else. This is why we focus on empathy only after being able to understand our own feelings because if you can’t understand your own, it would be extremely hard to understand another’s feelings.
- In the critical chain methodology, resources are pooled or buffered at each step of the critical path of a project to reduce the chances of resourcing being a reason for delay. This was decided after extensive research showed that insufficient resources along the critical path caused the most delays. If a task is outside of the critical path, resourcing delays should not impact the overall timeline of the project.
- The number one rule for any status is that for every action, an owner and date must be identified. This helps ensure the right people are accountable for actions and that the stakeholders know when to expect a resolution. This conveys that you, as the TPM, are in control of the situation and are proactively engaged in all issues.
  In some cases, an action item may not have a date at the time of a status report; in these cases, a date should still be supplied as a date for a date (DFD). This lets people know when to expect a concrete plan of action.
- If you are brought in to help decide which design choice is the best to move forward with, your knowledge of downstream systems can help you realize potential issues with a design that they are not aware of. You may also know about programs that may have an impact on the design.
- Looking back at project planning, one key handoff is when a task is taken from the project backlog and given to the development team to design and implement. This handoff is a key point to ensure you drive as much clarity as possible. You do this by providing all of the context needed to do the task up front, and then by asking questions during design and estimation.
- Practice thinking about a situation as another person to gain their perspective and understanding, and although you may not agree with their point of view, you should be able to start understanding where their point of view comes from to find a path forward.
- Each of these aspects plays into how the stakeholder communication plan comes together, from the number of communication formats to the frequency of the reports being sent out. Being consistent and reliable here instills confidence in your executive sponsors and leadership that the project is headed in the right direction.
    - Note: The aspects being different properties of the audience
- here’s a list of things to consider that turn an okay status report into a great one:
  Every action must have an owner and date
  Define your traffic light and stick to it
  A non-green status must have a path to green
  Keep important details above the fold
  Format and grammar matter
- During design reviews, always ensure you are looking upstream and downstream of your system to ensure proper alignment in data flows, as well as at other projects that may be working in the same code packages concurrent with your project.
- Inspecting broadly can help ensure you are influencing not just your project but your organization and driving everyone toward your shared goals.
- The frequency can vary based on the number and type of stakeholders as well as the complexity of the project. For instance, a plan with tight timelines, or a lot of dependencies, may warrant a more frequent communication cycle to help ensure the project stays on track by surfacing problems more quickly to the relevant groups.
- The key to active listening is that you listen to understand instead of waiting to respond to what you believe is being said. You do this by: ... Risk log: This is a log of the risks as discussed in Chapter 7. If the number of risks is large, I usually just include the high-risk items in the status report with a link to the full risk log. The goal here is to show the most relevant information to your stakeholders. ... Being present in the conversation: ... Open and recently resolved issues: This is a list of issues that are currently being tracked. These are separate from the known tasks and the known risks but will include realized risks as they move from being a potential issue to an active issue that is currently being dealt with. ... Utilizing non-verbal cues: ... Feature deliverables: This is a list of deliverables, usually synonymous with the top-level tasks (also called epic tasks) in a task list. This lets the stakeholders know when to expect a specific feature or group of features and varies with every project. ... Project milestones: There are two schools of thought on milestones. They are either a list of predefined phases or steps that every project goes through, such as implementation, testing, deployment, launch, and post-launch, or they are used as shorthand for the deliverables of the project. I use the former as it provides good metrics that can be used across all projects (such as how often a project’s deployment takes longer than expected) and separate this from the feature deliverables. ... Folding your arms, furrowing your brow, and pacing can all have negative impacts on a conversation and change the responses to something more confrontational or defensive.
- This isn’t to say you won’t have questions, but that the questions will be technical clarifications and deeper in nature. In fact, I encourage asking clarifying questions as this is key to driving toward clarity.
- As a TPM, you might be in a position to help drive the technical direction of your team. This involves knowing where your team and technology are headed, as well as the tenets that drive them. This knowledge will help drive your day-to-day direction and your design decisions by helping you connect problems and solutions across project and program boundaries.
- The frequency may also change during the life cycle of the project. I have found that it is useful to include a weekly status update when approaching the launch date and will often send out daily updates the week of launch. Not only does this help instill that you are on top of the project and in control, but it also gives quick feedback to everyone involved should issues arise during this time. Conversely, during the requirements and planning phase, the updates are published monthly as there is less movement to report.
- This context helped the developers understand why we were doing the project, which, in turn, helped them better understand their design choices and led to a better design that offered greater room for future scalability.
- These varying vantage points allow us to connect the dots across projects and programs.
- Risk management, or the identification of risks and the strategies that are planned to handle them once realized, is one of the most powerful cycles in managing a project. It interacts with and affects all other aspects of the project that we’ve talked about. This is because a risk—or opportunity—can occur anywhere!
- During a design discussion, the TPM is also responsible for ensuring the right people are in the room to make the most appropriate choices. To do so properly, you need to be able to speak about the design authoritatively and understand what the various stakeholders may need to get out of the proposal.
- As a TPM, you are often aware of many programs and projects that impact your team or organization. You work with other TPMs, other teams, and leaders to deliver your goals. This gives you both a deep knowledge of where you directly run your projects, as well as breadth in the technical landscape surrounding you.
- . A good project manager never stops thinking about risks and opportunities. We see risks from a mile away and home in on them when they become relevant. We don’t let them alter our course unexpectedly, as we have already planned a course correction.
- During requirement analysis, disagreement on a requirement or an ambiguous requirement is common. As you work with your stakeholders, any clarification may introduce new complexities or insights and can steer the conversation organically. I have found that knowing my system behaviors and complexities helps during these conversations.
- As a TPM, your job is to be a force multiplier; you get the right people in the right place so that a problem can be solved quickly and efficiently. And when you don’t know the right people, or the right place, communicate with your stakeholders to find answers quicker!
- It’s important to remember that a risk to a project is anything that poses a change to the plan that is in place. In traditional project management, this means a risk may be a positive change in one aspect but can still cause an overall delay.
- First up, here’s a quick inventory of what items should be included in a status report:
  Executive summary: This is a high-level leadership-focused summary of the progress that is easy to digest and clearly states the trajectory of the project. The traffic-light status is included here, as well as the items contributing to the current traffic-light color the project is on. ... Using open-ended communication: ... It allows for a stakeholder to be optional for a particular activity where their active participation is not required but they may choose to participate if it makes sense in a particular situation. ... Remaining neutral:
- Depending on where your requirements come from, they might include some technical details or push for a specific implementation. Being able to recognize these scenarios will give you the chance to challenge the requirements and dig deeper to find what the underlying requirement actually is. This is important because systems change over time and relying on a specific way to solve a problem can slow down the system’s natural evolution. Knowing what the actual requirement is allows the development team, along with the TPM, to find the best long-term solution to meet the requirements.
- Often, in these cases, the missed opportunities are not intentional—you are simply in the weeds trying to unblock your team—but to be an effective practitioner, you need to always ensure stakeholders are in the know. It can save you a lot of time and unnecessary work.

Highlights
### Career Paths
- As an arbiter in many conflicts, a TPM’s technical understanding of the problem at hand will aid in quicker arbitration. It also allows us to catch instances where the technical problem is not being conveyed properly across all parties—again, acting as the technical bridge.
- Proper communication can ensure the overlap is noticed, the plan is updated, and the situation is avoided or corrected as quickly as possible.
- Being an effective active listener increases your empathy for others, and it shows them that you are interested in their problems, not just a resolution that may or may not have their best interests in mind.
- Though the process isn’t as rigorous everywhere, treat it as seriously as any other deliverable you have. After all, it will have the largest personal return on investment compared to any other project you work on!
    - Note: Re: promotion
- The informed role is for all parties that only need to know of the outcome of a particular activity. In the example here, the business teams are informed about the designs, sprints, and work being done. The mechanism for informing can be the status report or meetings and does not need to be dedicated to each task.
- Most of the conflicts you will encounter in a project happen in stakeholder management. This is because it encompasses most communication with the people involved in the project, from the developers and team leaders up through company management.
- If stakeholders don’t believe in your ability to manage the project, they may start to challenge your decisions.
- Social skills are the outward-facing result of our own emotional awareness and control. A person with high emotional intelligence is an effective communicator, both verbally and in writing.
- Write out a plan and share it with your manager and mentor. Reference it often to make sure you are on the right path and so your manager can help you find the right opportunities. This will be one of the most important plans you create so don’t treat it any less than you would a project plan. It should have risks, a critical path, and key milestones (likely things like a specific project launch to showcase a needed skill).
- A similar role, called participated, can take the place of consulted or you can even leave both to differentiate a participating subject matter expert (SME) from a non-SME.
- Part of your job is to challenge the system design when it doesn’t fit the needs of the project and the needs of the organization.
- This is so fundamental to what we do as TPMs that consistent communication can come up in performance reviews and promotion documents. It’s a measurable artifact that demonstrates our ability to be an effective communicator—you can literally see a gap in a status, or that dates don’t line up to when they were promised. It can also lead to micromanaging from your stakeholders!
- Conflict occurs a lot in our daily lives, which is why we focus on conflict resolution a lot. Emotionally intelligent leaders are adept at resolving conflict by leading a conversation to a resolution, instead of demanding a specific outcome. Asking open-ended questions and allowing the conflicting parties to come to a resolution together is a key strategy for successful resolutions.
- Some companies are merit-based, meaning that once you have met certain criteria, your manager promotes you. This is not very common in the tech industry, which instead relies on proving oneself through their body of work and recommendations from colleagues.
- The consulted role involves the different roles that should be involved in a step but are not accountable or responsible for its completion. For example, developers are consulted during sprint planning because they help determine task estimation and capacity, but they do not own the sprint plan itself.
- As the TPM, you own the functional specification, you understand the requirements, and you know the architectural landscape, which gives you a unique perspective on the problem that the design is trying to solve.
- Some of my best status reports were a result of several hour-long meetings with stakeholders discussing exactly how goals, risks, and issues needed to be formatted to be clear.
- As Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said in an interview, “EQ trumps IQ.” Emotionally intelligent leaders will always prevail over those who are smart but lack the soft skills needed to reach their team and affect change.
- If you have ever worked on a service or product strategy document where you map out the next 3 to 5 years of direction a product should take, then you have worked squarely in the product manager area of focus.
- Never hesitate to verify!
- As a TPM, you are a leader in your organization. You effect change not only through your programs and projects but also as a contributor to the technical direction and strategies of your team. You identify problems but also resolve them.
- When it comes to earning trust, it often comes down to the perception that stakeholders have of your ability to deliver on the goals. Your best avenue to control that perception is through status communications. Work with your stakeholders to draft the right message based on your audience and what they perceive to be important information to have in the report.
- The ability to control and direct emotions for yourself and those around you is an effective tool for mitigating issues and resolving conflicts, in a compassionate and empathetic manner.
- In 2023, Airbnb’s CEO spoke about changes that the company had been working on since the 2020 pandemic in relation to the product manager role. The shift was to re-align the role to a product marketing style similar to Apple. In this role, the product manager is more focused on market trends, market research, and strategy. It was stated that the program management duties that the product managers used to do were given to actual program managers.
- For every project, ensure that you discuss the roles and responsibilities with the team. Don’t assume that everyone knows what their role is just because they’ve worked with you or on the team for previous projects. Especially for the roles that are adjacent to the TPM, the exact responsibilities can shift across the Venn diagram of overlaps from project to project.
- To do this, you are expected to find issues and define and drive solutions to fix them.
- I have found over the years that keeping all stakeholders up to date with all open issues is advantageous for a few reasons. Firstly, it provides the highest level of transparency to everyone involved, thereby building trust. The more the stakeholders know what issues are coming up and how they are being addressed, the more confidence they’ll have in the project. Secondly, they’ll have information to help resolve open issues.
- This shows that emotional regulation can not only impact your own actions but also the emotions of your entire team, or even the entire culture of your company.
- From both Oscar’s and Faheem’s journeys, we’ve seen the hallmarks of what makes a great TPM. They exhibit a drive to see a project through to completion, a willingness to learn and help those around them grow, and a desire to dig deep.
- Another example to differentiate responsible and accountable is that the TPM is accountable for delivering a milestone on time, but the developers are responsible for doing the development to complete the milestone.
- The most reliable way to find a problem worth fixing is to look at repeatable efforts across projects and recurring pain points during development. If the problem occurs often, the ROI is likely worth the effort to solve it. Use your knowledge of your system designs, architecture landscape, and even coding practices, along with your backlog of project issues and risks, to help understand where problems may exist.
- In most estimation systems, we use the task that is meant to be estimated as if it were the only task the developer was working on. This helps ensure that the estimate is a measure of the complexity of the task and not a reflection of their working environment. The TPM’s job is to take the environment into account, and this may require a buffer.
- Specifically, within the TPM role, controlling your emotions and the ways that they impact those around you can turn the tide in key decisions. It can ease tension during a firefighting escalation and can build strong emotional relationships with stakeholders.
- On occasion, a TPM will start their career as a TPM out of college, though this is becoming a rare occurrence as many companies are removing entry-level roles for TPMs, as can be seen through job opening trends over the last two years, opting instead for people switching to TPM after obtaining real-world experience.
- The accountable role is similar to the responsible role, but the accountable party is who ultimately deals with the consequences of something not getting done.
- It isn’t always your job to come up with the direction to go in but sometimes it is up to you to ensure that the chosen direction is being pursued. During project planning and design, you can reinforce the team or organizational direction by ensuring system designs and design patterns match the intended direction of the organization.
- There are a few key pieces of data that you need to gather for any project. Aside from the standard items of the task description, duration, and predecessors, you’ll want to capture the requirements that it satisfies.
- An important aspect to consider when making any decision is the emotional impact the decision will have on the team. The emotional response from your team can greatly affect the outcome of the decision and either help or hinder its ability to come to fruition.
- Your understanding of architectural landscapes and system designs can help you see how multiple projects fit with one another—how one project’s design may cause risk through interference with another—or allow you to realize a positive risk, where two projects in a program share design elements and can thus shave development time off one or both projects.
- The responsible role is where the person or group is responsible for the step or activity. It does not mean that they are the sole contributors or owners but are the ones responsible for its delivery
- Across all aspects of project management, a TPM’s technical toolset allows for quicker, more efficient execution by providing foundational context and knowledge in the problem space. The toolset also enhances the TPM’s leadership by effecting change in the technical direction of their organization.
- The project plan is a living document that goes through multiple phases during the life of the project. In the beginning, it is strictly a plan—it marks the planned path to get to the end. However, as the project starts, it will start capturing real-time data in the form of actuals: actual start date, actual completion date, as well as actual resourcing.
- If you are stopping a project, removing a feature, or otherwise impacting work that has already been done, relay the decision with compassion and a strong focus on the vision. If someone understands why a decision is being made and how it ultimately aligns with the vision of a company or product, emotional duress is lessened.
- At the end of the day, if your technical toolset allows you to navigate technical teams, technical requirements, system diagrams, and planning, then you will succeed.
- The style of chart used in this table is also referred to as a RACI (pronounced race-y) chart. It’s an acronym for the roles represented: responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed.
- Crashing is the act of having multiple people work on the same task at the same time. This can be in the form of overlapping sub-tasks such as quality assurance and the actual implementation or splitting the development up among multiple developers. The crashing count is the maximum number of resources that the task can handle but doesn’t represent the actual number of people you might assign if everything is going okay. I have found that having this available ahead of time speeds up my ability to react to changes where I can speed up a task that is in danger of missing a milestone or that impacts other work from being able to start on time.
- Risk analysis can also consider emotional impact, although we often refer to this as risk attitude, or risk tolerance. This is the level of risk an individual or organization is able to tolerate to meet the desired outcome.
- To be clear, not all companies actually use the term TPM and continue to use the generalized PM moniker instead. Make no mistake, though—positions that work with technical teams definitely require a technical background. This allows TPMs to dive deeper than just tracking milestones and deliverables, and also ensures that the right solution is being built for both the project and the organization.
- the last component of the communication plan is the roles and responsibilities. Understanding the expectations of every stakeholder in the project is important to ensure work gets done smoothly. It also helps inform natural escalation paths if a task is delayed or otherwise in trouble.
- Last but not least, the start date and end date round out the remainder of your basic plan.
- Risk attitude spectrum (adapted from Hillson & Murray-Webster, 2005)
- However, this goes deeper into the project deliverables down to the development tracks. This is because they have more meaning to the stakeholders reading the project status report.
- As people come and go from the project, requirements are refined, and designs are finalized, you will keep this table up to date to ensure the right people are informed and consulted throughout the project. For me, it’s one of the most referenced project artifacts that I produce, as I look at the list on an almost daily basis.
- There are a few different types of predecessors you can have. The most common is the finish-start relationship, shown as fs, where the task number listed must finish before the given task can start. Start-start (ss), start-finish (sf), and finish-finish (ff) all exist as well and follow the same paradigm.
- the range of emotional responses to uncertainty. When comfortable with change, someone can range from being risk-tolerant to actively seeking risks, and ultimately, being risk-addicted. The reverse is true when someone is uncomfortable with change. A person can swing from tolerance, via aversion, to outright paranoia.
- Risk strategy refers to the strategies the TPM will use to handle the risk should it occur. Common strategies are acceptance of the risk and the consequences, mitigating the impact of the risk, avoiding the risk, and transferring the risk to another party.
- During project execution, especially during low-level designs, details may come to light that highlight a stakeholder that you weren’t aware of. New developers may also come on and off the project, requiring updates to your list.
- Catching these optimizations in the plan that are based on how to fast-track and how a particular story might be broken down into smaller deliverables is a key way in which a TPM brings value to the planning process.
- What do you do if you have both risk-averse and risk-seeking stakeholders? These are the scenarios where following a set risk assessment procedure will help smooth out emotional responses. Scoring risks also reduces the introduction of bias and forces discussion on the true inherent risk associated with an event or action.
- Risk score is a rating rubric that is used to assess the level of a risk based on how likely it is to occur and how much of an impact the risk would have on the project. It’s a way to remove bias from risk analysis and adds objectivity to risks. Most risk score ratings are on a 100-point scale where a 100 is essentially an inevitable risk that will cause a large disruption to the project plan. Any score above around 65 means the risk likely needs to be monitored closely.
- Requirements gathering and refinement is an opportunity to not only understand your requirements better but also determine who the requirements impact or involve, such as the owner of a service.
- When moving fast, removing repetitive work is the highest-value place to focus your energy to reduce effort and increase productivity.
- Although a good subject and amazing venue can help, without an engaging speaker, the talk just wouldn’t be memorable at all.
- Status is a summary concept that uses a word, sometimes combined with a color, to signify the high-level state of the project, program, or open issue. The most common system utilizes traffic light colors to signify the state, with red meaning a blocked state, yellow or amber meaning the path forward is uncertain, and green signifying that it is going as planned.
- However, I try to not send status updates on Fridays or Mondays. On Fridays, people will miss or gloss over the status before heading out for the long weekend, and in many countries, holidays land on a Monday, meaning you may not be in the office. Sending it on Monday would mean that you would frequently have to send it on the next business day. Even if you stay on top of communication and let the stakeholders know, it will still feel inconsistent, so it is better to avoid this.
- As a bonus, this list is also a good place to pull from for software improvements as repeatable work is the best to automate as it tends to have a high and guaranteed return on investment (ROI).
- You can use emotion to motivate your team or inspire a positive work culture.
- Each of these views has its purpose, but to see the full city, you have to lose this specific focus on a singular building or district. You cannot see everything at once, but can only choose the level on which you focus.
- Though this may feel like a lot of reports, with good timing, it’s not as much as it seems. The key is to time the spacing of each to allow for the collation of information into the next communication level up.
- As you work on your projects, look at the items you are repeating the most and start creating a list of these items along with standard operating procedures for them. When you are in a hurry on the next project, run down the checklist.
- Motivation is a key aspect of leadership, and emotional intelligence is at the root of successful motivation. Leaders regulate their emotions and use the emotional response of their team to propel compelling visions forward.
- The communication of risks, as alluded to in the stakeholder discussion, will often focus on high-risk items that are a threat to the overall program and leave the project risks to the project level.
- The key to a good report, regardless of the audience, is to decide what your narrative is going to be. Even if you don’t write the report using a narrative frame, knowing what you are trying to convey will help you decide the right information to include or even how to frame the information you present.
- For a project plan, tasks such as requirements gathering and verification, creating functional specifications, and launch plans are tasks that are present for every project. In software development, tasks such as code deployment, integration testing, and end-to-end testing are also always present. These may be added at the end of the project plan, or per feature or milestone, depending on how your software landscape operates.
- Most of the actions we take center on being emotionally empathetic to our stakeholders—actions like having regular and open communication or reaching out before a status report is sent out to let them know what will be said. These are all instances where best practices are put in place because they show empathy and understanding.
- While a project may move quickly and warrant a bi-weekly status update, a program may have a status update monthly or quarterly. The goal here is to let stakeholders know that the program is moving in the right direction. This could be that each project is delivering the right thing at the right time, or that a problem exists, and the right measures are being taken to correct it.
- A typical cadence for an SLR is once a quarter. In this case, the SLR combines all LRs from the quarter (or the previous quarter, depending on timing) into a single report with an emphasis on the end goals and major steps, victories, and misses in the time since the last SLR. When combining these reports, not all of the lowlights, highlights, and key insights will be relevant to senior leadership. As such, it is important to think about what is important to this audience to remove noisy updates that don’t contribute to the end goal.
- The level of ambiguity and the confidence of the estimate work together as a scorecard to determine the buffer. In increments of 5%, high ambiguity adds 15% with low at 5%, and the reverse for confidence, with high confidence at 5% and low at 15%. This added to the team overhead gets you the percent increase for each estimate.
- Knowing that I understood the concerns and presented a solution that left room to address the concerns allowed the stakeholder to change their position and move forward with the model changes.
  Without recognizing their emotions and acknowledging them, the situation would have likely remained at a standstill or caused an irreversible decision to be made that was not in the best interests of the company in the long term.
- With multiple projects, there are often multiple leaders or drivers, each maintaining their own plan schedule that ties into the program plan schedule. This, again, is similar to a project plan but with a larger scope.
- The senior leadership review (SLR) builds on top of the leadership review with a target audience of senior leadership. Not every project will have a need for an SLR, as it depends on the level of visibility the project has at that level in the company. If there is interest at the senior leadership level, a dedicated communication forum is needed to convey details with the right context.
### The Technical Toolset
- Each team should have its own overhead, which should be revisited often to ensure it reflects the current realities of the team.
- Unlike a typical project where the planning stage happens once, the planning stage of a program iterates as projects open and close. Though a singular plan is created in the beginning, multi-year programs will revisit the planning stage often, as projects become clearer over time
- Filling in organizational gaps is part of what a TPM does best!
- Table 6.7 makes adding buffers formulaic or straightforward. However, as was alluded to, there is nuance involved here. I’ve spent the better part of my career refining the buffers I use, and I always scrutinize my percentages when there are changes to the team or organization or I’m simply starting a new complex project.
- The TPM handles the day-to-day work with the technical teams and must understand what their technical teams are doing. The closer aligned the technical backgrounds are between the TPM and their teams, the better they’ll be able to respond to issues and set them up for success.
- A program-wide milestone can help provide cohesion and context across teams, driving better alignment for the program.
- Though this is often a monthly review, this doesn’t mean that the issues that surfaced are sitting and waiting to be discussed in a monthly forum. Any item that is new in this review should be resolved and is merely being reported if it is important enough for leadership to know about. If your team is blocked, work to unblock them as quickly as possible, and if you need leadership input, don’t wait!
- If you find yourself disagreeing with a definition, that’s okay; regardless of what you call something, what it is doing is the important part.
- This power can compound the longer you work with a specific team and understand their frameworks, services, service pipeline infrastructure, and software languages. All of this information can speed up your estimation of tasks and your ability to understand what work can be done in parallel or fast-tracked.
- that just as with tasks within a single project, not all the projects within a program start at the same time and can vary for the same reasons—whether resource constraints or internal and external dependencies.
- changes or even lower-level stakeholder changes will require you to adjust what you are saying and how you are saying it.
- Milestones are often predetermined and, in some organizations, are exactly the same for every project. These are goals during the project cycle that the project is moving toward.
- asking the right questions can mean the difference between a well-laid plan and a late-running, over-budget disaster.
- A program is very similar to this concept, but usually on a much larger scale. Instead of a single multi-month project, the end goal may take multiple years. Each of the milestones may be different enough to warrant different personnel or strategies. In that sense, each of these becomes a project in itself (with its own milestones) that spans the program timeline. They all come together to deliver the goal of the program.
- Beyond these basics, some leadership reviews contain learnings, highlights, lowlights, and other thought-leader types of information.
- Somewhat in contrast to this, a feature list is specific to a project. As the name suggests, it’s a list of features that are being built that can be deployed independently. This is what most companies mean when they use the term milestone.
- The Global Process Owner (GPO) role focuses on change management, acceleration, and process improvement skills such as Lean and Kaizen.
- The first thing you would do is break the project up into smaller deliverables, or milestones. Each of these should deliver a feature or functionality that, when put together with all the other milestones, achieves the goal(s) of the project.
- The leadership review (LR) is a status report whose audience is the leadership. As such, the focus isn’t on the day-to-day work or issues but on the longer-term progress of the project, along with risks, issues, and milestones that have a greater impact on the project goal.
  These updates often happen with less frequency than regular status updates as the long-term health of the project won’t typically change so often to warrant a more frequent update.
### Code Development Expectations
- most stakeholders don’t want to sift through a full project plan to discern what is happening
- a program is a combination of multiple projects, often spanning multiple years, that achieves a common goal. Each project may have its own goal, but it will also contribute toward the goal of the program.
- For all communications that involve some level of status dissemination to stakeholders, it is extremely important to be upfront about any issues you are going to raise. This needs to happen before the status is sent out so that the impacted stakeholders can have a chance to respond or be prepared to answer any questions. It also helps ensure that your relationship with the stakeholders remains healthy and they don’t feel like you are setting them up for failure.
- From my experience, and through the interviews I conducted for this book, tech companies don’t follow a projectized resourcing model where a project is formed, resources are assigned, and the project keeps the same funding throughout the life of the project. Instead, these large companies utilize capacity-constrained prioritization, where they perform multiple prioritization exercises throughout the year to align their existing capacity to the most strategic projects.
- The type of code I’ve written as part of my role was only to help me perform my job and was not related to project deliverables.
- Instead of just the day-to-day operation of one project or even multiple unrelated projects, you will manage or oversee multiple projects with a shared goal. The distinction here is the shared goal, which provides the opportunity for synchronization and mutually beneficial planning.
- Most projects will have some form of a status update, either in a written format or via a status meeting. The purpose here is to give a health check on the project at the moment in time with some projection as to the overall health. The focus is on current and upcoming milestones, blockers, and risks with a high-risk score (in other words, risks that have some chance of being realized in the near future). To this end, this type of report tends to be more technical and is meant for the stakeholders who are actively working on the project itself in order to keep them apprised of what is going on around them.
- Many tech companies have started a trend of hackathon weeks, availability weeks, or improvement weeks. These all are geared toward allowing developers to work on projects that directly impact their services’ maintainability or add some quality-of-life features.
- I’ve heard of TPMs writing code in start-ups. This aligns with our need to wear many hats because the number of people involved in a start-up is comparatively small and the need to step up has a higher chance of occurring.
- A well-written status report, whether it’s a document, an email, a slide deck, or even verbal communication during a meeting, conveys urgency where needed and demands action. It calls attention to problem areas and aligns everyone to the next steps. It lays out all the risks so that when a risk is realized, it isn’t a surprise. It instills confidence in all the right people in your ability to deliver the project.
- The stand-up can also help you craft the status updates as you have the most current task progress as well as projected work for some amount of time (sprint, week, or other, depending on the development methodology). Depending on the team culture or the number of projects you are driving, you may not attend the stand-up, but an update should be produced in some form, either by updating a sprint board, or a written status summary from the developers.
- In prioritization meetings, I am often approached by management asking what dates I could meet with x, y, or z resources. So, instead of me dictating the number of people I need, I help weigh the number of resources against priority based on the best ROI I can provide.
- As a TPM, your focus will not be on writing code yourself, but on getting it written through others.
- Communication amplifies cohesion and is a vessel for transparency.
- If you have a large number of stakeholders that span many different disciplines and aspects of the project, an additional role of optional can be added, or using parenthesis around informed or consulted to indicate optional ... I usually have a separate table that I move resolved items to after they are shown as resolved in a status update. This reduces the size of each table and makes it easier to focus on the information that matters—the currently opened and in-progress work. ... A solutions architect is similar but is focused on the cloud architecture of an ecosystem, specifically one that is moving from a local data store to the cloud. ... Contact information: In case of issues or concerns, a reader of the report needs to know who to contact.
  Project description: Not every stakeholder will remember what the project is about, especially in large organizations and email distribution lists, so including a blurb on the project helps set the context of the status update.
- When planning a project, ensure that you do not forget about overhead. Either ahead of a project, or through multiple projects with multiple teams, build up tables of standard items per team such as vacation trends, on-call rotations, team outings, or improvement weeks, as well as training.
- This is what I mean when I say control; it’s not that you are micro-managing every aspect, but that you understand enough to know when to trust and verify and when you need to be in the middle of a problem working toward the solution.
- You must share your intended plan with stakeholders, work with your teams for resourcing, and discuss and analyze every risk you can think of. This is also true when working with your engineering team—you listen to them, understand their needs and concerns, and act upon them.
- Usually, a 10-minute conversation with an SDM to talk through the overhead list from this chapter and fill in values is enough time for a rough number.
- If we don’t understand what our team is doing, and if we can’t relate, push back, and advise, then we will never have complete control over our project.
- As a TPM running a program, one of your responsibilities will be to find opportunities across project boundaries to optimize time, effort, and scope. This is done by evaluating the technical requirements and possible solutions to optimize the path forward, which can lead to a better architecture by ensuring designs across projects align and are consistent where feasible.
- Similar to knowing the ins and outs of a system, knowing how your system connects to other systems in the company ecosystem can help you notice patterns or places of concern that others closer to the project cannot see.
- A software architect is a specialized role that focuses on the landscape architecture of a large system. ... A glossary of terms: This won’t make or break a status report, but if it is included, you will receive praise. Tech companies are large, and the number of three-letter acronyms (TLAs) that are in use can quickly become daunting. Just as not everyone will know the project, not everyone will know all of the terms being used. Be kind and don’t assume
- This is yet another example of where a technical program manager brings value to the program by evaluating technical avenues to increase the efficiency of the plan.
- When mapping out an architecture landscape, you may focus on different aspects of system relationships, such as system dependencies or data flow. Each of these aspects brings a different perspective of the landscape to light and may aid in answering different questions.

Highlights
### Section 2: Fundamentals of Program Management
- Even in this case, there is no full guarantee that your stakeholders will receive the information, or read it, but this puts the most critical information at the top and increases the chance of it being seen.
  This means that your most important information–project status, path to green, and the executive summary–must always be first and foremost in a status report. Senior leadership may not need to know all of the details of how something is being accomplished, but they need to know that the project team is being proactive and that they have the situation under control.
- When you are faced with a set of requirements or goals and are trying to decide whether to spin up a project or a program, there are a few litmus tests you can do to see whether a program is the right fit:
  Do you have multiple goals to achieve?
  Is the timeline fixed or based on achieving the goals?
  How many stakeholders are involved?
- Given the broader scope of architecture landscapes compared to a system design, the level of depth you’ll be expected to understand is much more shallow. After all, these systems are not your immediate concern, so knowing about their internal data flows is not nearly as important as understanding the input and output of the systems.
- However, the tech industry does not fit the mold for a standard Project Management Professional (PMP) style approach. It’s dynamic, fast-paced, and views the project management triangle in a different light than is seen in other industries.
- Once you are below the fold, the information becomes more granular, with updates on the sprint schedule, project burndown, and risk and issue logs. This is where the team leads and development managers will get the most value in knowing what the day-to-day is like in the project.
### An Introduction to Program Management Using a Case Study
- If you have multiple goals to achieve, then multiple projects, one or more per goal, would ensure clarity of purpose for each project. In this case, a program to manage these projects would make the most sense.
- An architecture landscape is a map of application and service interconnectivity at an organization or enterprise level. It’s similar to a system design but has a wider scope.
- A consistent format that is easy to follow and understand is important. The more time that the reader has to spend on understanding what you are trying to say, the less they will spend reading in the future, and instead will just send out emails or meetings to discuss the status.
- If the goal you are trying to achieve has a deadline, this is often a reason for a focused project to drive toward the deadline. If you have multiple goals and one is time-bound, a program with a project specifically for the time-bound goal may be a good fit.
- As the bridge between the business team and the technical team, it is important to understand the why and how of your systems as much as the why and how of your business.
- Outside of that setting, a charter is still a useful document as it serves as an overview of the program, who the key stakeholders are, who is on the program team, and the overall scope, timelines, and budget or resource constraints.
- Listen to your stakeholders and work to find ways to format your status to make your stakeholders comfortable with how the status is presented. It will save a lot of time during moments of high-stress movement in the project to not have to go over misunderstandings because the status format didn’t make sense.
- Lastly, if your goal spans multiple departments or organizations within your company, all driving toward the goal or goals, a program with projects per organization may be the most effective way to manage the large number of stakeholders.
- I find that to truly understand an API, it’s best to also understand why it exists in the first place. This goes deeper than the answer that it exists to vend certain data. You need to ask why the API was created in the first place instead of extending an existing API and what service boundaries the API is working within.
- In many cases, a formal document like this isn’t used in the tech industry but the intent behind this document is captured in some form.
    - Note: the document being a project charter
- grammar matters – to an extent. I’m not suggesting that perfect Honors-English-level grammar is required, but clear and concise sentences and correct word choice can also improve comprehension among stakeholders.
- In most cases, your day-to-day experience with system design will involve writing functional specs and participating in design reviews. This means you will mainly be learning existing systems, so understanding how to dive deep into a system is an important skill to hone
- When done right, this will cover the problem statement and the goal, as well as the business case. It captures these because they are the most useful aspects of a charter.
- Spending time upfront to find a format that reduces day-to-day work can quickly add up in times of high churn in a project and allow you to put your effort toward more critical work.
- Risk assessment starts as soon as you have enough information to start assessing, which can be as early in the project as initiation.
- You cannot effectively write a functional spec without understanding the system that the functional spec is referencing.
- It’s important to understand why a program is trying to achieve something just as much as it is important to know what it is achieving. The why comes from both the problem statement as well as the business case. As an added bonus, both of these statements often provide good ideas for key metrics that the program can track.
- The information above the fold is the most pertinent to understanding the state of the project and no additional information should be needed. This includes the status color and target date for the status, the summary of where the project is at, and the path to green. Since the project isn’t green in this example, the status conveys why the status is yellow and includes the PTG with an owner
- The key here is recognizing patterns of data flow, user interactions with the system, and trends.
- System design involves mapping the components and data flow within a system or service. It is also the most commonly exercised technical proficiency for a TPM.
- The program roadmap is the end-to-end program plan that accomplishes the goals set forth in the program charter, including the number of projects, their boundaries, and their interdependencies.
- Program-level metrics don’t change enough on a weekly basis to track them, and the audience at the status level is less concerned with overall program health and more concerned about the day-to-day work.
- The track and document steps were added to the existing three steps that were covered in Chapter 5—that is, risk identification, risk analysis, and update plan—to round out the process. Each of these steps is part of the assessment cycle, which is a continuous process throughout the project.
- As a TPM, you will rarely be asked to write code. However, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be proficient.
- Put succinctly, the goal is a guiding principle to ensure the direction of each project is aligned with the purpose of the program.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), metrics, and product telemetry are used to measure the success of something. Every program is measured by metrics or KPIs, which measure the goal of the program as well as monitor the health of existing features.
- Each of these tools is an accelerator to your role when your proficiency matches the needs of your team. In cases where it doesn’t match, you will need to lean on a specialist that does have that proficiency, such as a specific programming language. This will add time to the project as additional communication is needed to get the same results you would get if you were proficient in the right technical skills.
- The number of organizations that are involved in a program can necessitate different status reports, for instance, as each organization cares about its specific contribution to the program.
- In addition, your communication plan should specify which tools you will be using to communicate. If you can standardize your communication tools for your project, it will reduce churn and facilitate effective communication to and from your stakeholders.
- The individual complexity of a project may also warrant a separate status so that as much detail as is needed can come out.
- The risk register is a central repository for all risks that have been identified in previous projects completed in a company or organization. Often, they are categorized in some fashion so that they are searchable based on similar project traits. This could include working with a specific system or team, dealing with the same clients, having the same level of complexity, and more.
- Instead of a central repository, the risk register often relies on tribal knowledge. This refers to the implicit and explicit knowledge relevant to the organization that is not written down.

And here, once again, are my reflection. Given this, write a summary of the book in my style focusing mostly on my reflections but also including a brief, high level summary of the content of the book

## Reflections

The author clearly knows his stuff. Based on this book, this is someone I would love to work with. However, the book itself was middling for me. This is best targeted at someone who is just moving into a TPM. For someone who has been in the role or even for someone who has done non-trivial amounts of program coordination even without the TPM title, the book will come across as fairly basic. Thus, for my purpose of figuring out how to be a better manager for a TPM team, I rate it 3/5 although that reflects the fitness of the book for my purpose and my inability to personally judge how useful it would be for someone earlier in their career. 

- Did I learn? Did I acquire new information?
    - A little. There were some useful tips, but nothing really fundaentally new.
- Did I grow? Did the form of my understanding change?
    - Not really.
- Was it well written? Was it structured well, coherent, beautiful?
    - Moderate. It was very well structured. The writing was fine although a bit dry and repetitive at times.
- Did I enjoy it? Do I look back upon it fondly?
    - It was fine.
- Other thoughts

### Review of _Technical Program Manager’s Handbook: Unlock your TPM potential by leading technical projects successfully and elevating your career path_

**Overview and Reflections**  
The author’s expertise in technical program management is evident throughout the book. Their experience, insights, and practical approach shine through, making it clear that they are someone who would be a pleasure to work with in a professional setting. However, the book itself falls squarely into the category of an introductory guide, best suited for those newly transitioning into the Technical Program Manager (TPM) role or exploring the fundamentals of program management for the first time. 

For a reader like myself—someone already familiar with the core concepts of program coordination and seeking advanced insights into managing TPMs or leveling up an existing skill set—the content felt basic and repetitive. As such, I found it to be less useful for my particular goals. That said, my personal experience likely limits my ability to assess its value for someone at the beginning of their TPM career. For that audience, this book may prove to be a valuable resource.

**Personal Reflections on Key Questions:**
- **Did I learn?** I picked up a handful of practical tips and reminders, but nothing fundamentally new or transformative.
- **Did I grow?** No. The material didn’t challenge my understanding or significantly shift my perspective on program management. 
- **Was it well written?** The book is well-structured and organized for clarity. However, the prose can be dry and occasionally repetitive, which may make it a less engaging read.
- **Did I enjoy it?** It was fine. While I appreciated the author’s expertise, the content didn’t resonate strongly given my expectations and needs.

**Content Summary**  
The book is divided into three main sections that build on the fundamental competencies and technical toolkit of a TPM:  

1. **Understanding the TPM Role:**  
   This section introduces the TPM role, emphasizing its core responsibilities, functional competencies, and distinctions from adjacent roles like product managers and development managers. The author underscores the importance of driving clarity, managing cross-functional dependencies, and leveraging emotional intelligence to succeed.

2. **Foundations of Program Management:**  
   Through case studies and actionable advice, this section covers the essentials of managing programs, including plan creation, risk management, and stakeholder communication. It emphasizes clarity in all aspects of a TPM’s work, from requirements gathering to resolving ambiguity during execution.

3. **The Technical Toolkit:**  
   The final section delves into technical proficiencies, such as system design, architecture landscape analysis, and risk assessment. While it provides useful foundational knowledge, the technical content is pitched at a level that might feel overly basic for experienced TPMs or those with strong technical backgrounds.

**Final Thoughts**  
While this book didn’t meet my specific needs, it could serve as a helpful primer for individuals exploring the TPM role or navigating their first technical program. Its structure and focus on clarity make it accessible, though the dry tone and repetitive elements might limit its appeal for readers seeking inspiration or advanced techniques.

Overall, I’d recommend this book to new TPMs or professionals transitioning into program management. For experienced TPMs or managers looking to deepen their strategic understanding, it’s likely to fall short. **Rating: 3/5.**

**Overview and Reflections**  
The author’s expertise in technical program management is evident throughout the book. Their experience, insights, and practical advice shine through, making it clear that they are someone I would enjoy working with in a professional setting. However, the book itself felt middling for my purposes. It is best targeted at someone newly stepping into the Technical Program Manager (TPM) role or exploring program management fundamentals for the first time. For readers already familiar with program coordination or managing TPMs, the content may feel basic and occasionally repetitive. 

That said, I acknowledge that my perspective limits my ability to judge how transformative this book might be for someone earlier in their career. For those new to the TPM field, it likely serves as a valuable primer.

Did I learn from it? A little. There were a few practical tips and reminders, but nothing fundamentally new. Did it challenge or expand my understanding? Not really—it didn’t push me to grow or shift my perspective. However, the book’s structure is solid, its focus on clarity is commendable, and the writing, while functional, lacks the vibrancy to make it an engaging read. Overall, it was fine—neither a standout nor a disappointment, but a decent resource for its intended audience.

**Content Summary**  
The book is divided into three main sections that guide readers through the foundational aspects of being a TPM:

1. **Understanding the TPM Role:**  
   This section introduces the role of a TPM, distinguishing it from adjacent roles like product and development managers. It emphasizes the core competencies of driving clarity, managing cross-functional dependencies, and utilizing emotional intelligence to succeed.

2. **Foundations of Program Management:**  
   Covering case studies and practical techniques, this section addresses key TPM responsibilities, including program planning, risk management, and stakeholder communication. The recurring theme is clarity—transforming ambiguity into actionable plans at every stage of a project or program.

3. **The Technical Toolkit:**  
   The final section explores the technical proficiencies that set TPMs apart, such as system design, architecture landscape analysis, and risk assessment. While the content is helpful for beginners, experienced TPMs might find it too elementary.

**Final Thoughts**  
Ultimately, this book didn’t meet my specific needs as a manager looking to grow a team of TPMs. However, it’s a strong starting point for someone beginning their TPM journey. The practical, structured approach ensures accessibility, even if the tone occasionally feels dry. For experienced TPMs or managers seeking deeper strategic insights, the material may feel underwhelming. That said, for its intended audience, it likely delivers well.

If you’re exploring the TPM role or transitioning into program management, this book offers a clear, practical guide. For seasoned professionals, you may want to look elsewhere. **Rating: 3/5.**
