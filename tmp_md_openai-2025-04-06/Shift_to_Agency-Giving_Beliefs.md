Agency-taking or agency-giving beliefs
A useful tool during self-reflection, this framing helps us spot unproductive behaviors that may arise from various beliefs we hold. It is based on a deceptively simple distinction: given a belief we might have, is it taking agency away from us, or is it giving us agency?

An agency-taking belief usually stops us from doing what we want to accomplish. For instance, we might want to get into better physical shape, but to do that, we must spend money on joining an expensive fitness club or invest inordinately large amounts of time into strenuous exercise. Who has the time?! This belief is agency-taking, because it creates a barrier to us getting fit. If we change this belief to “maybe all it takes is a few minutes of daily exercise?”, we will suddenly gain more agency.

Similarly, we might believe that the only way to support our family is to stay at a place of employment we don’t enjoy. This belief takes away agency, given that there are certainly a lot more other options than the one our belief dictates. 

It is often not easy to tell whether a given belief is agency-taking or agency-giving. Just like with everything in self-reflection, we are masters of twisting what we see in ourselves to fit into a nicer story. There are two useful markers that can help. 

First, agency-giving beliefs usually touch something uncomfortable within us. They are usually asking us to contend with some inner truths that often feel best left unquestioned. After all, more agency means more uncertainty. Struggle and pain often accompanies shifting toward an agency-giving belief. If it’s easy, we’re probably moving the other way.

Second, agency-giving beliefs tend to lead to novel outcomes. If we feel like we’re trying to change our beliefs toward more agency, yet the outcomes remain the same, we are probably deluding ourselves. The lack of novel outcomes is a sure sign of an agency-taking belief taking hold.

Agency-giving beliefs don’t necessarily contain answers to hard questions. In themselves, they will not make us fit or find us a better job. However, they will help us start thinking about new possibilities and sharpen our sense of interesting opportunities. They will shift our agency toward us. We will still need to work – even harder than before – to properly recognize the possibilities and capitalize on those opportunities.

But at least we will have the shot at them – something that’s simply inaccessible behind the veil of agency-taking beliefs.
