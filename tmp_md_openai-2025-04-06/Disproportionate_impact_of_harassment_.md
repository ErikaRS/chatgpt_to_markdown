What is the effect where minorities disproportionately are impacted by harassment?

The effect where minorities are disproportionately impacted by harassment is known as "disproportionate impact" or "disparate impact." This refers to the phenomenon where certain groups or individuals experience negative effects of a policy, practice, or behavior more severely than others, even if the policy, practice, or behavior is not intended to discriminate against them.

In the case of harassment, certain minorities may experience more severe and frequent incidents of harassment compared to others due to their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other characteristics. This can lead to a range of negative consequences, including mental and emotional distress, reduced job performance, decreased job satisfaction, and even physical harm.

Addressing disproportionate impact requires a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in all aspects of an organization or society. This includes creating policies and practices that are inclusive and accessible to all, providing training and resources to educate people on the harmful effects of harassment and discrimination, and actively working to dismantle systemic barriers and biases.

That's not quite what I was looking for. I was looking for the effect where just due to the mathematics of the situation, minorities are more likely to be harassed than the overall statistics about harassment and fly

I see. The effect you are referring to is called "statistical discrimination" or "statistical harassment." It occurs when a minority group is more likely to be harassed or discriminated against not because of any individual characteristics or behavior, but simply because of their membership in that group.

For example, if a company has a policy of only hiring people with certain qualifications, but those qualifications are biased towards a certain demographic group, then members of other groups may be unfairly excluded from job opportunities. Similarly, if a particular type of job or industry is known for having a high incidence of harassment, members of certain demographic groups who are overrepresented in that job or industry may be more likely to be harassed.

This statistical discrimination or harassment can create a vicious cycle where members of certain groups are discouraged from pursuing certain careers or opportunities, further perpetuating the disproportionate impact of harassment and discrimination on those groups.

To address statistical discrimination and harassment, it is important to implement policies and practices that are designed to reduce bias and promote diversity and inclusion. This can include targeted outreach and recruitment efforts, diversity training for employees, and policies that promote fair and equal treatment for all individuals regardless of their demographic characteristics.

If one in 100 people at a company harass but only one in four people at the company are part of the harassment minority then people in the minority experience a higher probability of harassment. What is that effect called?

The effect you are referring to is called the "disproportionate impact" or "disparate impact" of harassment. Disparate impact occurs when a seemingly neutral policy or practice has a disproportionately negative impact on a particular group of people based on their protected characteristics, such as race, gender, or sexual orientation.

In the example you provided, even though only 1% of people at the company engage in harassment, the fact that only 25% of the company belongs to the minority group that is more likely to be harassed means that individuals in that group are more likely to experience harassment compared to their overall representation in the company.

This disproportionate impact can create an unfair and discriminatory environment for members of the minority group, leading to a range of negative outcomes such as reduced job satisfaction, emotional distress, and decreased productivity.

To address the disproportionate impact of harassment, companies can implement policies and practices that are designed to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. This includes creating a culture of respect and accountability, providing training and resources to educate employees on the harmful effects of harassment, and implementing reporting mechanisms and consequences for individuals who engage in harassing behavior.
