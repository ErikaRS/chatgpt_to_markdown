Start a draft with this:
A.G. Lafley, inspired by Chris Argyris, introduced assertive inquiry as a practice that balances advocacy with curiosity, offering a structured approach to uncovering hidden insights. Reframed through the lens of "I might be missing something," this method transforms discussions from debates over correctness into collaborative explorations of possibility. It is a practice deeply aligned with adaptive thinking, where complexity and change demand humility, flexibility, and a relentless focus on learning.

Openness to what we might be missing broadens our cognitive horizons. This mindset invites us to examine the uncharted corners of our assumptions, moving us beyond the narrow confines of our current understanding. It prioritizes curiosity over certainty, encouraging us to integrate diverse perspectives into more robust and nuanced solutions. By fostering cognitive diversity, this approach helps individuals and teams uncover blind spots that might otherwise lead to oversimplifications or errors in complex, high-stakes environments.

Consider the example of a leadership team confronting declining morale in their organization. Initially, they may default to addressing surface-level symptoms—organizing team-building events or offering temporary perks. But one leader suggests asking, “What might we be missing about the sources of discontent?” This simple question shifts the focus. Through open dialogue, the team discovers previously unvoiced frustrations: employees feeling undervalued, a lack of clarity around roles, and inconsistent communication from management. Armed with this insight, they can make deeper, more systemic changes to rebuild trust and engagement. The power of assertive inquiry in this scenario lies not only in uncovering hidden dynamics but also in fostering a culture where speaking up feels safe and valued.

This reframing also builds psychological safety. The phrase "I might be missing something" carries a disarming power, shifting interactions from confrontation to collaboration. It signals humility and a willingness to learn, creating an atmosphere where others feel encouraged to share their thoughts and challenge ideas without fear of reprisal. For adaptive teams, this safety is a foundational element of resilience and innovation, enabling members to voice concerns, propose novel solutions, and collectively refine their approaches.

Another significant strength of this mindset lies in its alignment with iterative progress. In a world of constant flux, no idea or decision is ever truly final. Acknowledging that we might be missing something positions inquiry as an ongoing process rather than a quest for a single, perfect answer. This iterative approach mirrors the adaptive rhythms of living systems, where responsiveness and continuous learning are critical for long-term success. It encourages teams to test, learn, and refine their strategies in cycles, ensuring that they remain attuned to changing realities.

Yet, this openness must be practiced with discipline. Without clear boundaries, the search for what is missing risks devolving into over-analysis or decision paralysis. Similarly, in competitive environments, openness may be misinterpreted as weakness, exposing well-meaning practitioners to exploitation. To counter these risks, assertive inquiry benefits from frameworks that provide focus and structure. Practices such as time-boxing, anchoring to specific goals, and creating feedback loops ensure that openness remains a tool for clarity and action rather than a source of endless questioning.

Ultimately, Lafley’s vision of assertive inquiry as "I might be missing something" is not just a method of questioning—it is a philosophy of discovery. It transforms inquiry from an exercise in defense to an opportunity for growth, fostering an adaptive, iterative approach to understanding that is uniquely suited to the complexity of the modern world. This practice invites us to embrace the uncertainty of not knowing as a strength, using it to uncover new possibilities and navigate the unknown with confidence.
