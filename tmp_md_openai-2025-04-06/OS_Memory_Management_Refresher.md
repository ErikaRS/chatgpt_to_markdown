Given the exchange below, explain the relevant OS memory concepts to me assuming an undergraduate CS education that's a couple decades old (both in terms of being a bit of of date and a bit out of my memory)

Q: What should I understand about os memory management to really grok this article?  

A: To fully grasp the article, you should understand that operating system memory management involves distinguishing between different types of memory usage, such as anonymous memory (heap and stack), filesystem cache, and kernel memory. Additionally, recognizing that memory metrics like "working set" can include recently accessed file pages and kernel memory helps clarify how resource usage is reported and interpreted, ultimately influencing performance optimization decisions.

Here’s a refresher on the key OS memory management concepts mentioned in the exchange, explained with the assumption that your CS background is solid but a little dusty:

---

### **1. Types of Memory in an OS Context**

#### **Anonymous Memory**
- This is memory that's not backed by a file on disk.
- It includes:
  - **Heap**: memory allocated via `malloc` or similar. Grows as programs dynamically allocate memory.
  - **Stack**: for function call frames, local variables, etc. Grows and shrinks as functions are called and return.
- Called *anonymous* because it doesn't have a name or file association—just raw pages allocated to a process.

#### **Filesystem Cache (Page Cache)**
- When your system reads a file, it often keeps a copy of the file’s data in memory for faster access later.
- This memory is technically *used*, but it's *reclaimable*—if another process needs memory, the OS can evict this cache.
- This can lead to confusion when interpreting "used" memory on systems like Linux—high memory usage doesn’t necessarily mean you're out of memory.

#### **Kernel Memory**
- Memory used by the OS kernel itself (not user-space processes).
- Includes:
  - Kernel data structures
  - Buffers for device I/O
  - Memory management structures
- Generally not swappable and managed separately.

---

### **2. Memory Metrics in Performance Tools**

#### **Working Set**
- Refers to the set of memory pages a process has *recently used*.
- It typically includes:
  - Pages touched in the last few seconds or minutes (depending on the system’s definition).
  - This includes both anonymous memory and file-backed memory if it's been accessed recently.
  - May include some kernel memory that's "charged" to the process, like certain types of shared buffers.

---

### **3. Why This Matters for Understanding Performance**

- Modern systems overcommit memory and rely on page caches and virtual memory to optimize performance.
- Knowing the difference between *used* and *committed* memory helps explain why, for example, memory pressure doesn’t always show up as processes being swapped.
- Misunderstanding these distinctions can lead to incorrect conclusions, like assuming high memory usage means a memory leak when it might be just aggressive file caching.

---

### **Quick Sketch of the Mental Model**
- Think of the OS as juggling:
  - Real memory (RAM)
  - Virtual memory (what processes *think* they have)
  - Disk (as backing store for both data and overflow memory)
- The OS keeps as much useful stuff in RAM as possible, even if it’s not urgently needed, because free RAM is wasted RAM.

---

### **Reflection Prompt**
Later, consider how your own systems behave under memory pressure. Try comparing `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, or `smem` outputs to see what portion is cache, what’s anonymous, and what’s shared. That’ll help cement how modern systems actually use memory day-to-day.
