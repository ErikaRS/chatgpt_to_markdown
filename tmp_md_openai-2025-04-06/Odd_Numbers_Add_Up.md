The numbers in the list 1, 2, 5, 7, 3, 52, 41, 97, 111 add up to an odd number. To calculate the sum, you add all the numbers together:

1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 52 + 41 + 97 + 111 = 319

Since 319 is an odd number, the statement is true.

To figure out if the sum of the odd numbers in a list is odd or even first list out the odd numbers. Then find the sum of only those numbers. Then say whether it is odd or even.

In the following list, is the sum of the odd numbers odd or even: 1,2,5,7,3,52,41,97,111

Certainly! Let's go through it step by step to determine if the sum of the odd numbers in the list is odd or even.

1. First, identify the odd numbers in the list: 1, 5, 7, 3, 41, 97, 111. These are the numbers that cannot be divided evenly by 2.

2. Next, calculate the sum of these odd numbers: 
1 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 41 + 97 + 111 = 265.

3. Finally, determine if the sum is odd or even: 
To do this, we check if the sum, 265, is divisible by 2. If it is, then the sum is even; if it's not, then the sum is odd.

Since 265 is not divisible evenly by 2, the sum of the odd numbers in the list is an odd number.

Therefore, the answer is: The sum of the odd numbers in the list 1, 2, 5, 7, 3, 52, 41, 97, 111 is odd.

What is another way you can determine if a list of odd numbers add up to an odd number?

### Assistant - 2023-05-29 07:07:40

Another way to determine if a list of odd numbers adds up to an odd number is by considering the properties of odd numbers.

When you add two odd numbers together, the result is always an even number. For example:
- 1 + 1 = 2 (even)
- 3 + 5 = 8 (even)
- 9 + 7 = 16 (even)

Knowing this property, we can conclude that if a list contains an odd number of odd numbers, their sum will be odd. Conversely, if the list contains an even number of odd numbers, their sum will be even.

To determine if a list of odd numbers adds up to an odd number, you can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of odd numbers in the list.
2. If the count is odd, then the sum of the odd numbers will be odd.
3. If the count is even, then the sum of the odd numbers will be even.

By simply considering the count of odd numbers in the list, you can determine whether their sum is odd or even without performing the actual addition.

Generate a just of numbers and apply that method. Go through your reasoning step by step

### Assistant - 2023-05-29 07:08:22

Sure! Let's generate a list of numbers and apply the method to determine if the sum of the odd numbers is odd or even. Here's a list of numbers:

3, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 25

Step by step reasoning:

1. Count the number of odd numbers in the list.
   - In this list, the odd numbers are 3, 7, 9, 21, and 25. So, the count of odd numbers is 5.

2. Check if the count of odd numbers is odd or even.
   - Since the count is 5, which is odd, we can conclude that the sum of the odd numbers in the list will be odd.

Therefore, based on the method, we can determine that the sum of the odd numbers in the list 3, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 25 is an odd number.

Please note that this method relies on the property that adding two odd numbers always results in an even number, and it can be used to determine the sum without performing the actual addition.

When I was 32 my brother was half my age and my daughter was a newborn. Now I am 40. How old are my brother and my daughter?

### Assistant - 2023-05-29 07:15:35

If when you were 32, your brother was half your age, it means he was 16 at that time. This is because half of 32 is 16.

Now, let's calculate the age of your daughter. If your daughter was a newborn when you were 32, and you are currently 40, that means 8 years have passed since then. Therefore, your daughter is currently 8 years old.

To summarize:
- Your brother is 16 years old.
- Your daughter is 8 years old.

### User - 2023-05-29 07:16:04

How old is my brother now?

### Assistant - 2023-05-29 07:16:05

If your brother was 16 years old when you were 32, and 8 years have passed since then, we need to add those 8 years to his age.

16 + 8 = 24

Therefore, your brother is now 24 years old.
