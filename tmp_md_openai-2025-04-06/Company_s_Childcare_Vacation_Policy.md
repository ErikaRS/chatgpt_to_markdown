I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and I don't have access to personal data about individuals unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. I am designed to respect user privacy and confidentiality. Thus, I don't have specific information about your company's vacation policy. 

However, many companies offer different forms of family-friendly policies such as parental leave, sick leave, and flexible working hours. It's best to check with your human resources department or consult your employee handbook for accurate information regarding your company's specific policies.
