Write a ditty about the phenomenon of whale falls

### Assistant - 2023-04-11 21:31:49

(Verse 1)
In the deep blue sea, where the sunlight fades,
A tale of life and death cascades,
Whale falls, the giants' last embrace,
A banquet vast in the ocean's space.

(Chorus)
Whale falls, a phenomenon so grand,
Nurturing life in the abyssal sand,
A circle of life that never stalls,
As the ocean sings and the whale call falls.

(Verse 2)
From the surface, down to the depths below,
The leviathan's journey, a story untold,
Becoming a feast for the small and bizarre,
Feeding the creatures both near and far.

(Bridge)
Sinking slow, to the darkest realm,
A microcosm blooms in the inky swell,
From scavengers to tiny critters small,
A thriving ecosystem from the whale fall.

(Chorus)
Whale falls, a phenomenon so grand,
Nurturing life in the abyssal sand,
A circle of life that never stalls,
As the ocean sings and the whale call falls.

(Outro)
In the vast expanse of the deep sea blue,
A legacy lingers, a tale so true,
For the whale's descent brings life anew,
A phenomenon that mesmerizes and moves.

Write a limerick about the texas sharpshooter fallacy

### Assistant - 2023-04-11 21:32:54

There once was a shooter from Texas,
Whose aim seemed both bold and reckless,
He'd shoot at the wall,
Then draw circles so small,
Claiming skill, but his logic was feckless.

Express this lens as concrete poem:
This week’s lens: Confabulation.

We rarely get the full story. Even our memories of personal experiences are full of unreliable gaps. Add to this the fact that we hate sitting in uncertainty. Thus, to get by in the world, people are masters of confabulation. Confabulations, as described by a quote from Jonathan Gottschall in Brené Brown’s Dare to Lead, are “lies, honestly told.”

Confabulation is not always a bad thing. In the normal course of events, you have a pretty good mental model of the world, and applying those automatic confabulations is a necessary part of how we turn our streams of input into a coherent picture. It is not usually unreasonable to go from, “My friend gave me a gift on my birthday” to “My friend got me a birthday gift.”

Wait — were those two statements even different? This is where the unconscious power of confabulation comes in. The first statement is a description of a fact: a person (your friend) performed an action (giving you a gift) at a particular time (your birthday). The second quietly inserts an intent: the reason for the gift was your birthday. That might be true… or it might not.

When we see ourselves going from facts to story, we should remember that these are potentially lies. We need to acknowledge that we are confabulating and take a moment to make sure that the mental leap is justified. When we see others doing this, we need to remember that these lies are honestly told. Even when we have information that reveals that a gap was incorrectly filled, that doesn’t mean that it isn’t a logical inference for the other person given the knowledge and mental models they have. 

Seeing confabulations requires becoming comfortable with sitting in the gap between data and stories. This is a hard place to be, but even if we pause there only a moment, recognizing the moment where we might be confabulating gives us the power to choose whether to accept the story we tell ourselves, reject it, or gather more data.

Confabulation thrives in the gap,
Between the facts and stories we map,
With honest lies told,
Inferences unfold,
Our mental leaps we must unwrap.

Ode to Confabulation

I. Prelude

Oh, confabulation, thy art so sly,
Weaving stories from gaps, under the sky,
Of uncertainty, we dread, we shy,
To you, our minds are drawn, we can't deny.

II. The Nature of Confabulation

You gift us coherence, a mental balm,
Uniting fragments, in chaos, you calm,
Our streams of input, transformed by your charm,
A world that makes sense, we hold in our palm.

III. The Power of Confabulation

In subtle ways, you alter our view,
From "My friend gave a gift" to "Birthday, it's true!"
The intent you insinuate, to misconstrue,
But in your intentions, honesty, too.

IV. The Recognition

We must recognize, the lies you may sow,
Acknowledge your presence, as our stories grow,
In moments of clarity, we must forego,
The false leaps we take, to truly know.

V. The Wisdom

When we see others in your embrace,
Remember, their lies, are honestly laced,
With knowledge and models, their minds have traced,
A different path, our judgments misplaced.

VI. The Pause

In that gap 'tween data and tales we spin,
A pause, a breath, to let truth begin,
To weigh our stories, and look within,
Accept, reject, or seek facts again.

VII. Epilogue

Oh, confabulation, mysterious guide,
Your power can sway us, like a strong tide,
But with awareness, we'll no longer hide,
In the gap, we'll find wisdom, by our side.
