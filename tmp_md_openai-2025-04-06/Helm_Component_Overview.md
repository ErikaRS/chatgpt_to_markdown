As someone not familiar with helm (and pretty shakey on k8s) translate this for me. The domain specific bits are less important than the high level concepts.
Component is defined as logical feature domain (owned by team), consist of one or more deployment units from Sourcegraph Helm chart, either single Kubernetes StatefulSet (i.e. symbols) or Deployment (i.e. precise-code-intel-worker) or combination of multiple deployment units i.e. gitserver statefulset with shared logic from frontend and worker. Components also expose the application Prometheus metrics.

Absolutely — here's a high-level translation of that paragraph, with context and concepts broken down in plain language:

---

### Plain-language version:

A **Component** is a chunk of the system that represents a **logical feature area** — basically, a meaningful part of the app that a specific team is responsible for. 

Each component includes one or more **deployment units**, which are the pieces of software that get run on the servers (in this case, managed by **Kubernetes** using something called **Helm** — think of it like a config-driven way to deploy software automatically).

These deployment units could be:
- A **StatefulSet**, which is used when each copy of the service needs to have persistent identity or storage (like a data service or file store).
- A **Deployment**, which is more of a standard unit for running interchangeable copies of a service.
- Or a **combo** of several such units that work together — for example, a file server plus parts of the main app that handle its logic.

Each component also **shares monitoring data** — it reports performance and behavior metrics using **Prometheus**, a monitoring system.

---

### Concepts unpacked:

| Term | Meaning / Analogy |
|------|--------------------|
| **Component** | Like a "feature bundle" or mini-subsystem that a team owns. |
| **Deployment unit** | The actual code or service being run. Think: mini apps or workers. |
| **Helm** | A tool to install software into Kubernetes, kind of like package managers (e.g. apt, npm) but for cloud apps. |
| **StatefulSet** | Used when each service instance needs to remember who it is (like a pet, not a cattle). |
| **Deployment** | Used when any copy of the service is fine (stateless and replaceable). |
| **Prometheus metrics** | Monitoring info — how fast, how many requests, errors, etc. |

---

### Why this structure matters:
This way of organizing services lets teams:
- Take ownership of their own "features" from code to production.
- Mix and match the right kind of deployment strategy (stateful vs stateless).
- Monitor performance independently, even in a big, complex system.

---

When you have a moment later, take some time to reflect on:
- **How would you define a “component” in a system you’ve worked on?**
- **What patterns do you see in how services are deployed and monitored?**
- **Where might persistent vs stateless services apply in your own work?**

That kind of reflection builds fluency, even if you’re not deep in Helm or Kubernetes. Want me to help with a specific example from your context?
