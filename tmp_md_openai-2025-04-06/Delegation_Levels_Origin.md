The origin of the 5 levels of delegation described in the article you referenced is not entirely clear. The concept of delegation itself has been studied and written about extensively in management and leadership literature, but the specific categorization of delegation into five levels may have been developed by the author of the article or by other management consultants or experts.

However, it is worth noting that the idea of categorizing delegation into different levels is not a new one. In fact, it has been used in various forms by different authors and experts in the field of management and leadership. For example, in his book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," Stephen Covey describes three levels of delegation: "direct supervision," "results-based leadership," and "empowerment."

Similarly, management expert Ken Blanchard has described four levels of delegation in his book "Leadership and the One Minute Manager": "directing," "coaching," "supporting," and "delegating."

It is possible that the author of the article you referenced drew inspiration from these and other sources to develop their own categorization of delegation into five levels. However, without further information or clarification from the author, the exact origin of the 5 levels of delegation described in the article remains unclear.
