Job postings are often a weird mix of motivational, descriptive, and keyword soup to hit the right search queries. I am going to post a job description. Please critique it from the perspective of both someone looking for a job and from an SEO perspective for searches on sites like LinkedIn.

### Assistant - 2023-09-08 11:12:14

Of course! Please go ahead and share the job description, and I'll provide feedback from both perspectives.

# Why this job is exciting
Sourcegraph fundamentally solves big data problems, from indexing multi-terabyte monorepos and storing/serving source-code metadata artifacts, to indexing clusters of hundreds of thousands of repos and providing fast & high-quality ranking, to extracting meaningful relationships from source code to build a code graph which is used throughout Sourcegraph. You will be treating code search and the code graph as a big data problem.

As Engineering Manager, Search & Graph, your leadership and your technical expertise will help propel Sourcegraph’s Cody to become the top AI coding assistant and our Code Search product to become the “Google of Code Search”. Your team consists of high-agency, self-directed teammates, so you will have ample opportunity to dive in and be deeply technically involved yourself. 

Your extensive experience in high-scale sharded-computation “shards and mixers” architectures will help us define the scalability story for our search engine. Your experience in compilers and programming languages will help us extract a code graph that can be used to power a platform that drives everything from search and navigation to providing the best context for an LLM.

Alright, let's break down the job posting from two perspectives:

## Perspective of Someone Looking for a Job:
### Pros:
1. **Clarity on Timeline**: The job description provides a clear timeline of what is expected within one month, three months, six months, and one year. This helps potential candidates gauge the trajectory of the role and understand what they're signing up for.
2. **Emphasis on Impact**: The role is positioned as instrumental in driving Sourcegraph's product to be the "Google of Code Search". This can be enticing for potential candidates who are looking to make a significant impact.
3. **Technical Depth**: The job posting gives a clear indication that this role is deeply technical, which can be appealing for those wanting a managerial role that still allows for hands-on technical involvement.
4. **Inclusive Language**: Phrases like "make our team even more representative of the world’s population" highlight a commitment to diversity and inclusion.

### Cons:
1. **Potentially Overwhelming**: The number of responsibilities and expectations set for the first few months might be intimidating for some candidates. Some might fear they're being set up to fail or will be overwhelmed.
2. **Unclear About Benefits**: The posting doesn’t mention any benefits, work-life balance, company culture, or opportunities for personal and professional growth outside of the specific role.

## SEO Perspective for Searches on Sites like LinkedIn:
### Pros:
1. **Keyword Rich**: The job description is packed with relevant keywords such as "Engineering Manager", "Search", "Graph", "Code", "shards and mixers", "compilers", "programming languages", "ML", "AWS", "GCP", "Azure", and many others. This ensures that the posting will show up in a wide variety of relevant searches.
2. **Descriptive Titles**: The title "Engineering Manager, Search & Graph" is specific and will cater to precise search queries.

### Cons:
1. **Keyword Overlap**: While having a variety of keywords is good, there is a slight risk of keyword stuffing, which could make the posting appear less organic. Modern search algorithms can detect and penalize this.
2. **Potential Miss on Common Search Terms**: While the job description is rich in technical terms, it might miss out on broader search queries. Including terms like "leadership", "team management", and other soft skills could cast a wider net.

## Recommendations:
1. **Personalize the Introduction**: Start with why the company is unique or why someone would want to work at Sourcegraph, beyond just the exciting nature of the job.
2. **Benefits & Perks**: Include a section on benefits, company culture, and opportunities for professional growth. This gives a more holistic view of what it's like to work at Sourcegraph.
3. **Clarity on Reporting Structure**: Mention who this role will report to. This can give potential candidates an idea of the company's structure and their place within it.
4. **Location & Remote Work**: Clarify whether this is a remote position, if there's a preference for a specific location, or if there are opportunities for relocation.
5. **Clear Call to Action**: At the end of the job description, guide the potential candidates on the next steps, e.g., "Apply now" or "Reach out to [HR Name] for more details".

Overall, the job description is technically detailed and appealing for the right candidate. With a few tweaks, it can be even more effective both from a candidate and SEO perspective.

Now I'm going to go through paragraph by paragraph. For each paragraph, please make suggestions on how to make it more readable while still keeping the breadth of information and keywords.

First paragraph:
Sourcegraph fundamentally solves big data problems, from indexing multi-terabyte monorepos and storing/serving source-code metadata artifacts, to indexing clusters of hundreds of thousands of repos and providing fast & high-quality ranking, to extracting meaningful relationships from source code to build a code graph which is used throughout Sourcegraph. You will be treating code search and the code graph as a big data problem

### Assistant - 2023-09-08 11:17:35

Alright, let's take a look at the paragraph and see how we can enhance its readability.

**Original:**
Sourcegraph fundamentally solves big data problems, from indexing multi-terabyte monorepos and storing/serving source-code metadata artifacts, to indexing clusters of hundreds of thousands of repos and providing fast & high-quality ranking, to extracting meaningful relationships from source code to build a code graph which is used throughout Sourcegraph. You will be treating code search and the code graph as a big data problem.

**Suggestion:**
At Sourcegraph, we tackle substantial big data challenges. This includes:
- Indexing multi-terabyte monorepos.
- Storing and serving source-code metadata artifacts.
- Handling clusters with hundreds of thousands of repositories.
- Delivering rapid and high-quality search rankings.
- Extracting valuable relationships from source code to construct a comprehensive code graph, a key component of our platform.
