I have 20 minutes to get the kids a healthy dinner. They are not too picky, but they do generally prefer "kid foods" to more adventurous fare. 

What should I make or buy?

Here are a few quick and healthy dinner ideas for kids that you can prepare in 20 minutes or less:

1. Quesadillas: Heat a tortilla in a pan, add cheese, and any other toppings your kids like such as black beans, chicken, or peppers. Fold the tortilla in half and cook until the cheese is melted.

2. Stir-fry: Cut up some vegetables and meat (optional), and stir-fry them in a pan with some oil. Serve over rice or noodles.

3. Sandwiches: Make sandwiches with whole-grain bread, deli meat, cheese, and vegetables. Cut them into fun shapes or use cookie cutters.

4. Smoothies: Blend together fruit, milk, and yogurt for a nutritious and delicious smoothie.

5. Baked potatoes: Bake some potatoes in the oven or microwave and top with cheese, sour cream, and vegetables.

6. Homemade pizza: Use a pre-made crust or pita bread, and let your kids top it with their favorite toppings.

7. Tacos: Heat up some taco shells or tortillas, and let your kids fill them with meat, cheese, lettuce, and other toppings.

8. Veggie wraps: Use whole-grain tortillas or wraps, and fill them with hummus, sliced vegetables, and avocado.

Remember to offer plenty of fruits and vegetables, and encourage your kids to try new foods.
