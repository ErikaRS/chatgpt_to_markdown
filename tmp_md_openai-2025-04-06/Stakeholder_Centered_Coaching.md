Marshall Goldsmith's Stakeholder Centered Coaching is a leadership development approach that focuses on leveraging feedback from key stakeholders to drive personal and professional growth for leaders. The methodology is built around the idea that the most effective way to change behavior and improve leadership effectiveness is by involving those who are most impacted by the leader's actions—typically their colleagues, direct reports, and other key stakeholders.

### Key Features of Stakeholder Centered Coaching:

1. **Behavioral Focus**: The coaching targets specific behaviors that need improvement, which are identified through feedback from stakeholders. The focus is on observable, actionable behaviors rather than abstract traits or competencies.

2. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Stakeholders are actively involved in the process. They provide initial feedback, participate in ongoing dialogue, and later assess the leader’s progress. This continuous engagement ensures that the leader's development is relevant and impactful.

3. **Feedforward Approach**: Instead of dwelling on past mistakes, the process emphasizes "feedforward," where stakeholders provide suggestions for future improvements. This positive, forward-looking approach encourages constructive feedback and continuous growth.

4. **Measurable Results**: The effectiveness of the coaching is measured by the degree to which stakeholders perceive positive change in the leader's behavior. This is typically assessed through follow-up surveys or feedback sessions, ensuring that the impact of the coaching is quantifiable.

5. **Iterative Process**: The coaching is not a one-time event but an ongoing process. Leaders receive regular feedback, reflect on it, and make adjustments in their behavior, leading to sustained improvement over time.

6. **Confidentiality and Openness**: While the process involves multiple stakeholders, confidentiality is maintained. However, leaders are encouraged to be open about their development goals and progress, which fosters trust and transparency.

### The Process:
1. **Assessment**: The process begins with an assessment where the leader selects key stakeholders and gathers feedback on specific behaviors they need to improve.

2. **Goal Setting**: Based on the feedback, the leader sets development goals focused on specific behaviors.

3. **Action and Engagement**: The leader takes action on these goals, with regular input from stakeholders. This involves implementing suggested changes and seeking ongoing feedback.

4. **Follow-up**: Periodic follow-up with stakeholders assesses progress. This step is crucial as it provides measurable data on the effectiveness of the changes.

5. **Measurement**: Success is determined by the extent to which stakeholders perceive a positive change in the leader's behavior.

Marshall Goldsmith's Stakeholder Centered Coaching is widely used in leadership development because it is practical, results-oriented, and deeply involves those who are most impacted by the leader's behavior. This approach not only helps leaders improve but also strengthens relationships with their teams and enhances overall organizational effectiveness.
