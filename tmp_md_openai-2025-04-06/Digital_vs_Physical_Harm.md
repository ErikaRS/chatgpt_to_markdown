Suggest 5 other examples for this comment. The commonality is that the damage done should be the same either way but achievable through means both physical and not. 

Comment draft: 
I think the focus on physical damage here is interesting and not quite a fit for the modern world. Let's exclude speech for a moment and look at the fact that one, arguably 2, of these definitions (and my own personal definition, FWIW) include the their definition hurt, damage, killing, injury, abuse, destruction, harm against something as well as someone. 

But once we include something as well as someone, the focus on the physical becomes somewhat arbitrary. Is robbing a bank physically violence but doing it through digital means not?

Here are five additional examples where damage or harm can be achieved through both physical and non-physical means:

1. **Sabotaging a company's operations**: Physically damaging equipment to disrupt business operations versus launching a cyberattack to disrupt digital systems, causing similar financial and operational harm.

2. **Vandalizing property**: Smashing the windows of a storefront versus flooding its online presence with fake reviews, damaging its reputation and deterring customers.

3. **Destroying someone's livelihood**: Burning down a business versus hacking and deleting all critical business data, leading to the collapse of the company.

4. **Blocking someone's access to resources**: Physically locking the doors to prevent entry versus digitally revoking access to an online service or account that they rely on.

5. **Tampering with transportation**: Physically sabotaging a vehicle to make it unsafe versus digitally hacking into its software to disable critical functions, potentially leading to the same outcome of harm. 

These examples highlight that the essence of the harm or damage can be achieved in both physical and digital domains, raising questions about whether the distinction between them is meaningful.
