Do people actually believe in modern witchcraft? Like that they can be a hedge witch or part of a coven?

Yes, many people do believe in and practice modern witchcraft, also known as contemporary witchcraft or neopagan witchcraft. This includes Wicca, one of the most well-known forms of modern witchcraft, as well as many other related paths. While not all modern witches necessarily identify with the term "witchcraft," many do and embrace a variety of practices and beliefs related to it.

A hedge witch, for example, is often seen as someone who practices alone rather than as part of a coven. The term comes from the concept of "hedge riding," or journeying into other worlds, a practice associated with shamanism. Hedge witches might focus on practices like herbalism, healing, and working with spirits of nature.

On the other hand, some witches choose to practice as part of a coven, a group of witches who come together to practice rituals, spells, and other forms of witchcraft. This can provide a sense of community and shared learning.

It's also important to note that modern witchcraft is a very diverse and individualistic field. What one witch believes or practices might be quite different from what another does. For some, witchcraft is a spiritual or religious path. For others, it's more of a practical or magical path. And for still others, it's a combination of these aspects. 

However, skepticism and misunderstanding about modern witchcraft are common, largely because of mainstream misconceptions and historical persecution. People often get their ideas about witchcraft from movies, TV, or folklore, which can be very different from actual contemporary practices and beliefs. Modern witches often work to dispel these misconceptions and advocate for greater acceptance and understanding of their paths.

Tell me more about modern witchcraft. What does a hedge witch actually do? What are their beliefs? Do they really think magic is real or is it more of a metaphor for spiritual growth?

Hedge witchery, like much of modern witchcraft, is highly individualistic. There isn't a set doctrine or belief system that all hedge witches follow. However, there are some general practices and themes that many hedge witches share.

The term "hedge witch" is derived from the idea of "hedge-riding" or "hedge-jumping" which refers to shamanic practices related to journeying into other realms or altered states of consciousness. The "hedge" serves as a metaphorical boundary between the mundane, everyday world and the otherworldly or spiritual realm. 

Hedge witches often focus on practices like herbalism, healing, and nature-based spirituality. They may also be involved in divination, the practice of seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown through supernatural means. Often, hedge witches operate as solitaries, meaning they work alone rather than as part of a group or coven.

When it comes to beliefs, it varies widely. Some hedge witches might view their practice in a more literal sense, believing in the efficacy of spells or rituals to effect change in the physical world. For others, it may be more metaphorical or psychological, viewing the rituals and spells as ways to manifest internal changes and personal growth.

The concept of "magic" in witchcraft can also be complex and nuanced. In some cases, magic is understood in terms of energy manipulation or influencing probabilities. For others, magic might be viewed as a way of engaging deeply with symbolism, subconscious thoughts, or the power of intention. 

In any case, many who identify as witches, including hedge witches, do see their practices as meaningful and valuable, whether they understand them as literally magical, metaphorical, psychological, spiritual, or some combination of these. It's also important to note that practices of modern witchcraft, including hedge witchery, often involve a deep respect for nature and an emphasis on personal responsibility and ethics in one's actions.
