What is duckdb?

DuckDB is an in-memory analytical database system, designed to be fast, reliable, and easy to use. It's particularly optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) tasks, which means it's great for handling complex queries on large datasets, such as aggregations, joins, and window functions. What sets DuckDB apart is its ability to handle large datasets efficiently, even on standard hardware, making it a popular choice for data analysis and data science tasks. 

And just for a bit of fun: if databases were waterfowl, DuckDB would be the one gracefully navigating the data lakes with ease! ðŸ¦†ðŸ’»

Now, let me install DuckDB in our environment so we can dive into more details or queries you might have!
