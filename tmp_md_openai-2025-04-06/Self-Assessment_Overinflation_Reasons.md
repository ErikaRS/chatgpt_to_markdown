Okay, I'm just ranting but how do people get such an inflated view of their performance? E.g., how can someone rate themselves as "distinguished" (highest rating) when I've consistently told them  they are meeting expectations? Or how can they rate themselves as meeting when they are currently on a performance improvement plan?

Rant away—this is a frustrating but common issue in performance reviews. There are a few reasons why people overrate themselves:

### 1. **Self-Serving Bias**
   - People naturally interpret their own performance in the best possible light.
   - They remember their wins more vividly and downplay their mistakes.
   - They may believe they are working hard and assume effort translates into impact.

### 2. **Dunning-Kruger Effect**
   - The less competent someone is, the worse they are at evaluating their own competence.
   - If they lack self-awareness or an understanding of what “distinguished” truly looks like, they may genuinely think they are performing at that level.

### 3. **Poor Feedback Absorption**
   - Some people don’t internalize constructive feedback unless it is incredibly direct and repeated.
   - If they’ve been told they are “meeting expectations,” they may hear that as “I’m doing well” instead of “I have a lot of room to grow.”
   - If the feedback was softened (e.g., “you’re trending toward meeting expectations” or “there’s opportunity to improve here”), they might latch onto the least negative interpretation.

### 4. **Cultural & Psychological Factors**
   - In some cultures or work environments, self-promotion is rewarded, so people get used to inflating their performance.
   - If they’ve been in organizations where self-rating high gets them better reviews, they may just be playing a game they’ve learned.
   - Some people have fragile egos and can't handle the reality of underperformance, so they convince themselves they’re better than they are.

### 5. **Fear of Negative Consequences**
   - If someone admits they are underperforming, they might think it will hurt them in the review process.
   - They might assume self-rating low means they’ll get pushed out faster or won’t be given a chance to improve.

### 6. **Misalignment on Criteria**
   - They may not understand what distinguishes different performance levels.
   - If the rubric isn’t explicit or if they don’t have strong role models to compare against, they may believe they are better than they actually are.

**In the case of someone on a PIP rating themselves as “meeting expectations”**—that’s next-level denial, but it might stem from a belief that they’re already fixing the issues or that the PIP is a formality rather than a genuine indicator of underperformance.

Would you like to explore ways to help people calibrate their self-assessment better, or is this more of a venting session?

Just venting. I'm good now. Thanks

Anytime! Glad you got it out. If you ever want to brainstorm ways to make feedback *actually* stick, I'm here for that too. Hope the rest of your day is less aggravating!
