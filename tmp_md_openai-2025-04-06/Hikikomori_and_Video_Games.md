Japanese term social recluse video games

### Assistant - 2024-02-16 17:46:03

The Japanese term that refers to social recluses who often spend a significant amount of their time on video games, among other indoor activities, is "hikikomori." This term is used to describe individuals who withdraw from social life and seek extreme degrees of isolation and confinement. Hikikomori typically spend much of their time in their own homes and may rely heavily on video games, the internet, and other virtual means of entertainment and communication to pass their time, avoiding direct social interactions and public situations as much as possible. The phenomenon has been a subject of concern in Japanese society and has been studied both within Japan and internationally, as similar behaviors have been observed in other countries as well.

There's another game I'm thinking of that is used specifically for highly nerdy people

### Assistant - 2024-02-16 17:46:37

The term you might be thinking of could be related to a specific genre or game that has gained popularity within "nerdy" or enthusiast communities. While there are many video games that could fit this description due to their complexity, depth, or association with particular subcultures, a few examples stand out for their appeal to highly dedicated or "nerdy" audiences:

- **Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)**: While not a video game, D&D is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) that has a significant cultural impact and is often associated with nerdy subcultures. It requires deep engagement with its rules, lore, and character development.

- **Eve Online**: A space-based, persistent world massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) known for its complex gameplay, intricate player-driven economy, and massive player battles. Its depth and complexity appeal to a very dedicated player base.

- **Kerbal Space Program**: A space flight simulation game that is praised for its realistic physics and engineering challenges. It appeals to players interested in space exploration and the science behind it.

- **Magic: The Gathering**: Again, not a video game, but a collectible card game that has seen digital versions like "Magic: The Gathering Arena." It's known for its complex strategy and deep lore, appealing to a dedicated fanbase.

If you're thinking of a video game that's particularly popular among highly nerdy or enthusiast communities but doesn't fit the descriptions above, providing more details might help identify it more closely.

No, not names for the games. Games for the people

If you're referring to a term used to describe games that cater specifically to highly intellectual or "nerdy" people, rather than mainstream or casual gamers, there isn't a single Japanese term that encapsulates this idea. However, several concepts and terms are often associated with games that appeal to this audience:

1. **Otaku**: In Japanese culture, "otaku" refers to people with consuming interests, particularly in anime and manga, but the term has broadened internationally to include anyone with intense interests in specific, often niche areas, including video games. While "otaku" isn't a term for the games themselves, games that cater to otaku culture often include detailed storytelling, complex mechanics, and elements that appeal to enthusiasts of specific genres.

2. **Doujin Games**: These are indie games created by small teams or individuals, often catering to niche interests. They can be highly specialized and appeal to specific fan bases, including those considered nerdy or deeply invested in particular aspects of Japanese pop culture.

3. **Niche or Hardcore Games**: This isn't a Japanese term, but in gaming culture, games considered "niche" or "hardcore" often require or appeal to a high level of dedication, understanding, or skill from the player. These games might feature complex narratives, deep mechanics, or challenging gameplay that attracts a more dedicated or intellectually inclined audience.

4. **TRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game)**: While not exclusive to video games, the culture around TRPGs, which includes games like "Dungeons & Dragons," often appeals to people who enjoy deep storytelling, strategy, and character development. Japanese TRPGs also have a dedicated following and can involve intricate plots and character interactions.

5. **Simulation and Strategy Games**: Games that fall under the simulation and strategy genres, such as "Civilization," "Kerbal Space Program," or "Crusader Kings," appeal to players who enjoy thinking, planning, and strategizing over long periods. These games often have steep learning curves and complex systems that can be particularly appealing to intellectually curious or "nerdy" players.

The term you're looking for might depend on the context or the specific elements of gaming culture you're referring to. If there's a
