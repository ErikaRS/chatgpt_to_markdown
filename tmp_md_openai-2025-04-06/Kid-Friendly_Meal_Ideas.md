Here are a few simple, kid-friendly meal ideas that likely use ingredients you already have at home:

1. **Grilled Cheese Sandwiches**: Bread, butter, and cheese are all you need. Pair with tomato soup (if available) for a more complete meal.

2. **Quesadillas**: Tortillas and cheese, with optional extras like beans, corn, or leftover chicken. Heat in a pan until crispy.

3. **Pasta with Marinara**: Boil pasta (spaghetti, penne, etc.) and toss with jarred marinara or even butter and grated Parmesan for a simple option.

4. **DIY Personal Pizzas**: Use English muffins, bagels, or tortillas as the base. Add tomato sauce, cheese, and any available toppings like pepperoni or veggies.

5. **Breakfast-for-Dinner**: Scrambled eggs with toast, pancakes, or waffles. Add some fruit or yogurt on the side if you have it.

6. **Mac and Cheese**: A quick stovetop version using pasta, butter, milk, and cheese. You can add hot dogs or ham for extra protein.

7. **Chicken Nuggets & Veggies**: If you have frozen chicken nuggets, bake or air-fry them and serve with baby carrots or any simple veggies you have on hand.

8. **Sloppy Joes**: Ground beef (or turkey), ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar for a quick sauce over hamburger buns or toast.

9. **Tuna or Egg Salad Sandwiches**: Mix canned tuna or hard-boiled eggs with mayo and serve on bread or crackers.

10. **Rice Bowls**: Cook rice and top with any combination of leftover veggies, cheese, or proteins like beans, chicken, or scrambled eggs.
