   - Whether familial, romantic, or platonic, the dynamics of relationships continue to be central. Stories like *"Here Comes the Bride"*【53†source】blend the joy and tension of weddings with reflections on personal choices and societal pressures.

3. **Humor and Irony**:
   - Her later works maintain her characteristic humor and irony, often used to critique societal norms or illuminate character flaws. The whimsical handling of eccentric characters in *"An Afternoon with Mr. Jenkins"*【51†source】demonstrates her enduring wit.
