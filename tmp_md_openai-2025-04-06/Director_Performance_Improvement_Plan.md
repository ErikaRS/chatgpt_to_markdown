I am a software engineering VP at a small software company (50 swe, 200 total). A director who reports to me started out strong but is now acting defensive, answering questions that aren't the ones I ask, and taking ownership of the technical problem without owning the business problem. 

I believe he can be successful again. How might I get him on the right track?

Dealing with performance or behavioral changes in a direct report, especially at the leadership level, can be challenging. Here's a structured approach to address the situation with your director:

1. **Private One-on-One Meeting**: Arrange a private meeting with him in a comfortable and neutral setting. This ensures the conversation is confidential, and he feels safe to open up.

2. **Open with Positivity**: Start by acknowledging his previous successes and contributions. This sets a positive tone and indicates that you have his best interests at heart.

3. **Be Specific and Objective**: Discuss specific instances where you noticed the defensive behavior or where he did not address the business problem. Avoid making it personal or using accusatory language.

4. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Rather than telling him what's wrong, ask questions to understand his perspective. For example:
   - "I noticed that in recent meetings, you've responded to queries differently than before. Can you share what might be causing this?"
   - "How do you see the connection between the technical and business aspects of the projects?"

5. **Listen Actively**: Give him space to share his feelings and perspectives. This can provide insight into any underlying issues or challenges he's facing.

6. **Offer Support**: If there are challenges he's experiencing, discuss how you or the company can support him. This might include training, mentorship, or perhaps resources to alleviate workload pressures.

7. **Set Clear Expectations**: Reinforce what's expected of him in his role, especially concerning the integration of technical and business aspects. Make it clear that while technical expertise is crucial, understanding and addressing business problems are equally important.

8. **Create a Follow-Up Plan**: Set up regular check-ins to review progress and address any ongoing challenges. This not only shows your commitment to his success but also holds him accountable.

9. **Consider Training or Coaching**: If the issue seems to be rooted in skill gaps or behavioral traits, consider investing in training sessions or executive coaching for him.

10. **Promote Collaboration**: Encourage him to collaborate with other departments or teams, ensuring he gets a broader perspective on the business problems and understands the company's holistic goals.

11. **Document the Conversation**: While it doesn't need to be a formal record, it's essential to have a note of your discussions, especially the action points. This can be useful for future reference.

12. **Be Patient and Positive**: Behavior change doesn't happen overnight. Celebrate small improvements and be patient as he works through the feedback.

Remember, the goal is to re-align him with the company's objectives and ensure he's equipped to contribute effectively. Open communication, understanding, and support can go a long way in turning the situation around.
