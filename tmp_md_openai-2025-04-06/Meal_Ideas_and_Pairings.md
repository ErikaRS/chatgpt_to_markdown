Give me some meal ideas

### Assistant - 2024-09-01 11:05:55

I'll provide some meal ideas based on the recipes you frequently make. Let me take a look at your recipe collection and the common meals in your household first. 

I'll start by extracting and analyzing the recipes in the zip file you provided.

### Assistant - 2024-09-01 11:05:55

```unknown
import zipfile
import os

# Define the path to the uploaded zip file and the extraction directory
zip_file_path = '/mnt/data/recipes.zip'
extraction_dir = '/mnt/data/recipes/'

# Extract the zip file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(extraction_dir)

# List the extracted files to understand the structure
extracted_files = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(extraction_dir):
    for file in files:
        extracted_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))

extracted_files[:10]  # Show a sample of the extracted files for analysis
```

I've successfully extracted your recipe collection, and it appears to be organized into categories. I'll now look at the common meals in your household to better tailor my suggestions.

### Assistant - 2024-09-01 11:05:55

```unknown
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file with common meals
common_meals_path = '/mnt/data/Common meals in the Rice Scherpelz household - Sheet1.csv'
common_meals_df = pd.read_csv(common_meals_path)

# Display the first few rows of the data to understand its structure
common_meals_df.head()
```

Your list of common meals includes a variety of dishes, especially in the "Breads" category. Let me suggest a few meal ideas based on both your recipe collection and the meals you frequently enjoy:

1. **Naan with Indian Curry**: Pair your "Best Ever Naan" recipe with a homemade curry like Chicken Tikka Masala or a vegetarian option such as Chickpea and Spinach Curry.

2. **Biscuits with Sausage Gravy**: Use your "Buttermilk Biscuits" recipe to make a classic breakfast dish. Serve the biscuits with a rich sausage gravy.

3. **Garlic Bread with Pasta**: Your "Garlic Bread" recipe would be perfect alongside a pasta dish like Spaghetti Bolognese or Fettuccine Alfredo.

4. **Cornbread with Chili**: A comforting meal could be your "I Win at Cornbread" paired with a hearty bowl of chili, either beef or vegetarian.

5. **Sweet Potatoes with Pecans**: For a side dish, try your "Sous Vide Brown Sugar Sweet Potatoes with Pecans" with roasted chicken or turkey.

Would you like more ideas or details on any of these suggestions?

Suggest 7 more, with more vegetables

### Assistant - 2024-09-01 11:06:41

Here are seven more meal ideas with a focus on incorporating more vegetables:

1. **Vegetable Stir-Fry with Naan**: Use your "Best Ever Naan" recipe as a side to a colorful stir-fry featuring bell peppers, broccoli, snap peas, carrots, and mushrooms. Toss the veggies in a savory soy-ginger sauce.

2. **Roasted Vegetable and Pecan Kugel**: Your "Pecan Kugel" recipe could be modified to include roasted vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers, adding a hearty, veggie-rich twist.

3. **Buttermilk Biscuits with Veggie Pot Pie**: Serve your "Buttermilk Biscuits" with a creamy vegetable pot pie filled with carrots, peas, potatoes, and green beans in a savory gravy.

4. **Cheesy Bread with Tomato Basil Soup**: Pair your "Cheesy Bread" recipe with a fresh tomato basil soup made from ripe tomatoes, onions, garlic, and fresh basil, topped with a drizzle of olive oil.

5. **Sweet Potato and Black Bean Tacos**: Create tacos using your "Sous Vide Brown Sugar Sweet Potatoes" as a filling, paired with black beans, avocado, and a tangy lime slaw, all wrapped in soft tortillas.

6. **Garlic Bread with Ratatouille**: Serve your "Garlic Bread" alongside a classic ratatouille made from eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes, slow-cooked with herbs.

7. **Cornbread with Veggie Chili**: Use your "I Win at Cornbread" recipe as a side to a hearty vegetarian chili packed with beans, corn, bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes, spiced with cumin and chili powder.

These ideas should help you incorporate more vegetables into your meals while still enjoying the recipes you love. Let me know if you'd like more details or another set of suggestions!
