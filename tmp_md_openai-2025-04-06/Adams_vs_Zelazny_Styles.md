Douglas Adams and Roger Zelazny both offer imaginative and often humorous works, but their styles and the types of readers they attract have some key differences.

Adams is known for his absurdist, satirical style, particularly in *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*. His humor often revolves around the absurdity of bureaucracy, existential musings, and the randomness of life, presenting cosmic-scale problems through a lens of dry wit and chaotic scenarios. Adams appeals to readers who enjoy playful language, quirky characters, and a distinctly British style of humor. His works often attract people who like a blend of sci-fi with social commentary and don’t mind a lack of rigid plot structure.

Zelazny, on the other hand, often combines a poetic, mythological style with a sense of grand adventure. His prose, especially in works like *The Chronicles of Amber*, is more lyrical and character-driven, blending high fantasy with modern sensibilities. Zelazny appeals to readers who enjoy intricate world-building, morally complex characters, and stories that weave together myth, philosophy, and action. While his work has humor, it tends to be darker and more subtle compared to Adams' absurdity.

In terms of reader appeal: 

- Adams would likely attract those who enjoy clever absurdity, philosophical irreverence, and prefer entertainment mixed with satire.
- Zelazny might appeal more to readers who appreciate deeper emotional stakes, mythic storytelling, and a more serious tone that still leaves room for humor.

While there’s overlap for readers who enjoy innovative, genre-bending stories, Adams’s readers may lean toward the comedic, while Zelazny’s might lean toward the epic and introspective.
