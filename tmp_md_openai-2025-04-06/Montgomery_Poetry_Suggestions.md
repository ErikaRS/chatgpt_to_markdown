Based on the uploaded text, I couldn't locate specific poetry written by Montgomery directly, as most of the content appears to be prose from her novels like *Anne of Green Gables*. However, I can suggest poetic excerpts or reflections from her prose that feel lyrical and appropriate for someone who treasures quiet moments. Let me know if you’d like me to craft a selection inspired by her tone and themes!

What are some references to the danger of moonlight in Montgomery's works?

Lucy Maud Montgomery often imbued her works with vivid descriptions of nature, including moonlight, but she also infused this imagery with emotional and thematic undertones that hinted at its dangers. Here are a few references or themes related to the danger of moonlight in her works:

1. **Moonlight as a Symbol of Overwrought Emotions**  
   In *Anne of Green Gables* and other novels, moonlight often represents a dreamy, romantic state of mind. This can lead characters, especially Anne, to lose touch with reality or overindulge in imagination, resulting in mistakes or misunderstandings. For example:
   - Anne’s overly romanticized imagination sometimes causes her to misjudge situations or people, and moonlight serves as a backdrop for such moments of overreaching fancy.

2. **Moonlight and Loneliness**  
   Montgomery's short stories and novels occasionally portray moonlight as a trigger for loneliness or melancholic introspection. For example, in *The Blue Castle*, Valancy Stirling reflects on her life and unfulfilled desires during moonlit nights, which emphasize her isolation and longing.

3. **Moonlight and Misdirection**  
   The ethereal quality of moonlight can lead to confusion or danger in Montgomery's works. For instance, in *Anne of the Island*, moonlight scenes are sometimes accompanied by emotional missteps or fraught moments, like romantic entanglements or misplaced affections.

4. **Moonlight as a Source of Illusions**  
   Montgomery frequently uses moonlight to create an otherworldly atmosphere, but it can also symbolize how beauty and charm can be deceptive. The soft glow might hide imperfections or create an idealized version of reality, leading characters to misinterpret events or people.

5. **Warnings in Moonlight**  
   In some of Montgomery’s poetry, moonlight is associated with mystery or even foreboding. It creates an enchanting yet eerie environment that can make characters more susceptible to fears or fantasies.

These examples highlight Montgomery's ability to weave the complex duality of moonlight—its allure and its peril—into her storytelling. If you are looking for more specific quotes or excerpts, I can search for them or interpret passages based on her works in the file you've uploaded!
