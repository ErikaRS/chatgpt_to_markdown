The term "two-pizza team" originates from Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos. It's a metaphorical way of saying that a team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas. The idea is that smaller teams are more agile, have better communication, and can move faster.

However, the exact number of people that make up a "two-pizza team" can vary depending on who you ask and, perhaps humorously, on the size of the pizzas and the appetites of the team members. But generally, the number is often cited to be between 5 to 10 people.
