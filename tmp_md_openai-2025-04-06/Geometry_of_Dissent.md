Work a reference to 180 degrees (triangle) to this piece. Highlight that in bold.

ðŸ”¼ðŸ”½ The Geometry of Dissent
Itâ€™s time for an update to your teamâ€™s strategy. Leadership has decided to shift focus from user-driven innovation to aggressive cost-cutting and efficiency measures. This isnâ€™t just a tactical shiftâ€”itâ€™s a fundamental change in what the company values. You feel the tension: Do you stay and adapt? Push back and try to shift leadershipâ€™s thinking? Is it time to move on?

These three options illustrate Albert Hirschmanâ€™s model of exit, voice, and loyalty for the ways we can react in the face of a system we disagree with: 
Exit: Leave and seek better conditions elsewhere. E.g., if these cost-cutting measures arenâ€™t rolled back, youâ€™re out.
Voice: Advocate for change from within. E.g., you gather data to advocate for investment in innovation.
Loyalty: Stay committed. E.g., identify and implement cost cutting measures.

None of these options is better than the others. It depends on context, and each has a light and a dark side. Voice can be expressed as well-reasoned advocacy or cynical complaints and performative dissent. Exit can show up as an amicable, well-considered move toward something better or a toxic, knee-jerk reaction that burns bridges. Loyalty can be based on agreement and trust or it can become blind allegiance or complacency. 

And they are not exclusive. We often simplify these to a choice: exit OR voice OR loyalty. Yet in practice, itâ€™s a blend of the three forces, a ternary plot of your relationship to the system. For example, you may be deeply committed but still see a need to change some things (high-loyalty, high-voice, low-exit). Or you may have one foot out the door but still want to register your dissent (high-exist, moderate-voice, low-loyalty). Some of these blends have names. Disagree and commit is a way to combine voice and loyalty. Quiet quitting is the seemingly-paradoxical (and unsustainable) blend of exit and loyalty.


Your position in this ternary plot isnâ€™t static. As conditions evolve, your equilibrium shifts: if leadership starts listening, voice becomes more viable. If resistance is futile, exit may become inevitable. Navigating change requires being honest about what each force looks like in the moment. Are you raising your voice in good faith or just venting? Is your loyalty principled, or is it inertia? Is your exit strategic, or is it just avoidance? Is any of it having the impact you want it to have? 

This tension isnâ€™t limited to a change in team mission. The same dynamics exist at the scale of entire companies, institutions, and nations. The more voice is suppressed, the more people tilt toward exit. The more exit is difficult, the more we must choose between silent loyalty and futile protest. Systems thrive when all three forces remain in healthy tensionâ€”when loyalty isnâ€™t blind, voice isnâ€™t ignored, and exit isnâ€™t a punishment.

So next time you face a pivotal decision, donâ€™t just ask whether to stay, fight, or leave. Ask how much of each youâ€™re currently leaning intoâ€”and whether that balance is shifting in a way you can live with.

Here's a version with a **180 degrees (triangle)** reference woven in:

Or you may have one foot out the door but still want to register your dissent (high-exit, moderate-voice, low-loyalty). Some of these blends have names.

Would you like the triangle motif carried into the title or any visuals as well?
