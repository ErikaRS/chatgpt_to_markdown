Are some people incapable of having transcendent experiences?

This is a complex question, and much depends on how "transcendent experiences" are defined. If you're open to exploring the layers, here are a few perspectives:

### Definitions and Variability
- **Transcendent experiences** are often described as moments that feel profound, awe-inspiring, or deeply meaningful, often involving a sense of connection to something greater than oneself. These might occur in nature, during meditation, through art, or in spiritual contexts.
- People vary in their sensitivity to awe or their ability to "let go" and engage with experiences that might evoke transcendence. Psychological traits, cultural conditioning, and even neurobiology all play a role.

### Psychological Factors
- **Openness to experience:** People high in this personality trait are more likely to report transcendent moments, as they tend to engage deeply with novelty, beauty, and abstract ideas.
- **Mindset and skepticism:** A highly analytical or skeptical mindset might dampen one's ability to embrace moments that could feel transcendent for others. However, this doesn’t mean they're incapable of such experiences; it may take different triggers.

### Cultural and Social Factors
- Some cultures emphasize rationality or materialism, which might discourage seeking or recognizing transcendent experiences.
- Others grow up in environments that encourage spiritual practices or mindfulness, which may heighten their receptiveness.

### Neurobiological Factors
- Research shows the brain processes associated with awe, spirituality, and transcendent experiences involve the default mode network, which governs self-referential thinking. Some people may have differences in how their brains activate these pathways, influencing how often or deeply they experience such moments.

### Trauma or Blockages
- Some individuals who’ve experienced trauma or emotional suppression may struggle to feel the emotional openness necessary for transcendence. However, therapeutic practices can sometimes unlock these capacities.

### Universality
Most researchers suggest that transcendent experiences are a human capacity, but they might take different forms. For one person, transcendence may come through meditation or religious rituals. For another, it might be through scientific discovery or even a moment of intense personal connection.

Do you think it's more about finding the right context or a deeper question of capacity?
