        - 1. **Levels of scale** is the way that a strong center is made partly by smaller strong centers contained in it, and party by its larger strong centers which contain it.
        - 2. **Strong centers** defines the way that a strong center requires a special field-like effect, created by other centers, as the primary source of its strength. 
        - 3. **Boundaries** is the way in which the field-like effect of a center is strengthened by the creation of a ring-like center, made of smaller centers which surround and intensify the the first. The boundary also unites the center with the centers beyond it, thus strengthening it further. 
        - 4. **Alternating repetition** is the way in which centers are strengthened when they repeat, by the insertion of other centers between the repeating ones. 
        - 5. **Positive space** is the way that a given center must draw its strength, in part, from the strength of other centers immediately adjacent to it in space. 
        - 6. **Good shape** is the way that the strength of a given center depends on its actual shape, and the way this effect requires that even the shape, its boundaries, and the space around it are made up of strong centers.
        - 7. **Local symmetries** is the way that the intensity of a given center is increased by the extent to which other smaller centers which it contains are themselves arranged in locally symmetrical groups.
        - 8. **Deep interlock and ambiguity** is the way in which the intensity of a given center can be increased when it is attached to nearby strong centers, through a third set of strong centers that ambiguously belong to both.
        - 9. **Contrast** is the way that a center is strengthened by the sharpness of the distinction between its character and the character of the surrounding centers. 
        - 10. **Gradients** is the way in which a center is strengthened by a graded series of different-sized centers which then "point" to the new center and intensify its field effect.
        - 11. **Roughness** is the way that the field effect of a given center draws its strength, necessarily, from irregularities in the sizes, shapes, and arrangements of other nearby centers.
        - 12. **Echoes** is the way that the strength of a given center depends on the similarities of angle and orientation and systems of centers forming characteristic angles thus forming larger centers, among the centers it contains.
        - 13. **The Void** is the way that the intensity of every center depends on the existence of a still place — an empty center — somewhere in its field.
        - 14. **Simplicity and inner calm** is the way the strength of a center depends on its simplicity —on the process of reducing the *number* of different centers which exist in it while increasing the *strength*of these centers to make them weigh more.
        - 15. **Not-separateness** is the way the life and strength of a center depend on the ext to which that center is merged smoothly —sometimes even indistinguishably —with the centers that form its surroundings.

### Assistant - 2024-12-20 19:18:32

This detailed breakdown of *The Nature of Order: Book One: The Phenomenon of Life* by Christopher Alexander provides a comprehensive roadmap for understanding the book's structure and core themes. Here’s a concise summary of its organizational framework and key content areas to set the stage for a detailed review:

---

### **Prologue and Preface**
The prologue introduces the overarching philosophical questions explored throughout the four books of *The Nature of Order*. It positions architecture within the broader context of the universe, asking how design reflects and influences the fundamental nature of life. The preface then outlines the historical and intellectual underpinnings of our "confusion in architecture," critiquing mechanistic worldviews and proposing a shift toward a more life-centered approach to building.

---

### **Part One: The Foundations of Living Structure**
This section delves into the conceptual groundwork for understanding "living structure" and "wholeness." Key ideas include:
1. **What is living structure?**: Alexander redefines life as a quality that transcends biology, appearing in built environments, art, and ordinary events.
2. **Degrees of life**: He argues that life exists on a spectrum, observable in the built world and influenced by patterns and arrangements of space.
3. **Theory of centers and wholeness**: Centers are identified as fundamental units of life in space, interacting to create a living order.
4. **How life emerges from wholeness**: The recursive, interdependent relationships between centers create the "phenomenon of life."

---

### **Fifteen Fundamental Properties**
Alexander identifies 15 properties that underpin living structures, such as **levels of scale**, **strong centers**, **boundaries**, **alternating repetition**, and **positive space**. These properties serve as tools for identifying and creating life-enhancing designs and are demonstrated across examples in nature, traditional architecture, and art.

---

### **Part Two: The Personal and Empirical Nature of Living Order**
1. **The personal nature of order**: This part connects the concepts of living structures to human experiences, suggesting that life in design resonates with a deeply personal sense of harmony.
2. **The mirror of the self**: Alexander introduces a novel empirical test, asking whether a structure or design reflects the observer's sense of self and wholeness.
3. **Scientific observation beyond Descartes**: The book critiques reductionist science, advocating for a more integrative, holistic approach to observing and evaluating life in design.

---

### **Impact and Practical Application**
The final chapters examine the implications of living structure on human well-being and functionality. Case studies, such as the layout of living rooms and the design of public spaces, illustrate the practical application of Alexander’s principles. The conclusion ties these ideas back to their potential to transform the field of architecture.

---

### **Appendices**
The mathematical supplements offer rigorous analysis of the concepts introduced, providing detailed examples and theoretical frameworks to support the book’s claims. They explore topics such as the mathematical representation of wholeness, methods for quantifying life in structures, and links to physics.

---

This detailed structure encapsulates Alexander’s ambition to redefine architecture as a medium for fostering life, wholeness, and connection. With its philosophical depth and practical tools, the book is as much about transforming the built environment as it is about transforming how we see and interact with the world.

Background context: My highlights

## Highlights
- When we understand the art of building from this point of view of order, it not only changes our understanding of the building process, but also has the capacity to change our cosmology (Page 2)
- I wanted to be able to do the real thing - and for that I had to know what the real thing is. The reason was not intellectual curiosity-but only the practical reason _that I wanted to be able to do it myself._ (Page 2)
- Even now, on some days I look at the theory I have formulated in these four books and can hardly believe that it is true. It provides a view of the universe which is so surprising, and so much at odds with the normal common-sense ways of thinking about physical reality we have currently, that it seems almost like a fantasy, like some kind of science fiction. But then, on other days, I go through the arguments again and realize that no matter how strange these ideas are, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that they must be true. There seems to be no alternative way of putting things together at least not one that I have been able to discover in which we get a proper view of the things that are important (Page 2)
- _That is what the pattern language is a record of that stuff in us, which belongs to the ninety percent of our feeling, where our feelings are all the same._ (Page 4)
- I believe that we have in us a residue of a world-picture which is essentially mechanical in nature —what we might call the mechanist-rationalist world-picture. Whether or not we believe that we are subscribing to this picture, whether or not we are aware of the impact of its residue in us, even when we consider ourselves moved by spiritual or ecological concerns, most of us are stillI believe to a greater or lesser extent in the grip of some residue of this mechanical world-picture. Like an infection it has entered us, it affects our actions, it affects our morals, it affects our sense of beauty. (Page 7)
- The present conception of matter, and the opposing one which I shall try to put in its place, may y both be summarized by the nature of order. Our idea of matter is essentially governed by our idea of order. What matter is, is governed by our idea of how space can be arranged; and that in turn is governed by our idea of how orderly arrangement in space creates matter. _So it is the nature of order which lies at the root of the problem of architecture._ Hence the title of this book.
  When we understand what order is, I believe we shall better understand what matter is and then what the universe itself is. But so long as we are--even unconsciously-prisoners of a too-simple mechanical picture of matter, it is inevitable, I am afraid, that we - and the architecture we create must continue in the blind confusion which too many of us have experienced for more than half a century. (Page 8)
- However, the crucial thing which Descartes understood very well, but which we most often forget, is that this process is only a method. This business of isolating things, breaking them into fragments, and of making machinelike pictures (or models) of how things work, is not how real- ity actually is. It is a convenient mental exercise, something we do to reality, in order to under- stand it. (Page 15)
- In the world-view I am presenting, a second kind of statement is also considered capable of being true or false. These are statements about relative degree of life, degree of harmony, or de- gree of wholeness - in short, statements about value. In the view I hold, these statements about relative wholeness are also factual, and are the essential statements. They play a more funda- mental role than statements about mechanisms. It is for this reason that the view of order which I am presenting in this book inevitably involves us in a shift of world-view. (Page 17)
- Throughout this book I shall present a further and more extended idea of objective truth-one which extends the current idea of truth given us by 19th- and 20th-century science in such a way that it includes statements of value. As I hope to show, this new extended idea of truth is not only objective, but is also directly linked to people's feelings. Most importantly, this extended idea of objective truth will allow statements about relative harmony, wholeness, and so forth to be judged as true or not true. In this view, these kinds of statements are not left as private intuitive opinions or agendas, but describe the structure of things in the world as they are. (Page 18)
- What we need is a sharable point of view, in which the many factors influencing the environment can coexist coherently, so that we can work together - not by confrontation and argument-but because we share a single holistic view of the unitary goal of life. (Page 21)
- In this new view of order we shall find, necessarily, a post-Cartesian and non-mechanistic idea of what kinds of statements can be true, a theory in which statements about relative degree of harmony, or life, or wholenessbasic aspects of order - are understood as potentially true or false. This means we shall have a view of the world in which the relative degree of life of different wholes is a commonplace and crucial way of talking about things. (Page 22)
- To achieve this aim to make buildings which have life and profound order it is necessary to be rescued from the mechanistic trap by concentrating on the life and order of a building as something in itself. 22 I believe such a formulation can only come from a new view of the world which intentionally sees things in their wholeness, not as parts or fragments - and which recognizes "life," even in an apparently inanimate thing like a building, as something real. (Page 22)
- What is even more important, we shall see that the structure I identify as the foundation of all order is also personal. As we learn to understand it, we shall see that our own feeling, the feeling of what it is to be a person, rooted, happy, alive in oneself, straightforward, and ordinary, is itself inextricably connected with order. Thus order is not remote from our humanity. It is that stuff which goes to the very heart of human experience. We resolve the Cartesian dilemma, and make a view of order in which objective reality "out there" and our personal reality "in here" are thoroughly connected. (Page 22)
- Thus life is not a limited mechanical concept which applies to self-reproducing biological machines. It is a quality which inheres in space itself, and applies to every brick, every stone, every person, every physical structure of any kind at all, that appears in space. Each thing has its life. (Page 28)
- Our fighting spirit and our communicative edge occasionally let us down. Instead the brain sometimes overflows with thougha, emotions, and concerns for others, which actually prevent us from doing what we deep down feel would be the right thing - if we can feel what the right thing would be at that particular moment.
  The pitfalls of the mind are those situations where we lose our footing and freeze. (Page 32)
- Like biological life, it has a typical appearance. It is rather rough, not manicured. It is comfortable, rough around the edges, smooth as if it has been rubbed together. This kind of life is the ordinary life which is not connected to high art or fashion. It has nothing to do with images. It occurs most deeply when things are simply going well, when we are having a good time, or when we are experiencing joy or sorrow - when we experience the real. (Page 38)
- Under these circumstances, we are free of our concepts, able to react directly to the circumstance we encounter, and least constrained by affectations, concepts, and ideas. (Page 38)
- It is this very general life-formal, geometric, structural, social, biological, and holistic which is my main target. It includes the profound life of the geometric structure that we have seen in historical examples (their plaster, concrete and tile, the life of their colors and shapes). It includes the ordinary life, the actions and events which make us feel alive there, and which allow a happy everyday life to exist for the people and animals and plants who live there. And it includes the biological life, the nurture of the natural systems which exist in and among the buildings, so that they are biologically healthy. In a few cases, life in a thing, or in a person, or in an action, or in a building, reaches a level of intensity which is truly remarkable. This can happen in a work of art, or in a person's life, or in a moment of a day (Page 46)
- In part, these examples feel alive because they are as far as possibleconceptfree They are not based on images, or on ideas of reality, but instead they have reality itself coming to life in them in a free way. They are vigorous and straightforward, where the soul of the maker has entered the thing-or where the ordinary process of daily life, uncontaminated by ideas or notions of what to do, has unfolded in a way that we accept very easily.
  These things make us comfortable, because we recognize them as genuine. The life we feel in them comes from this genuineness. _Since it is our main intention to make things which feel alive in our own time,_ it is these modern versions which must especially inspire us. They are the springboard from which our own efforts must come. Our own effort to form life in our time, because it must be consistent with 20th-century life as we now find it, and as we have now created it, is the most inspiring thing of all, and our chief target. (Page 50)
- To produce this life, we must first see how life springs from wholeness, and indeed how life is wholeness. Wholeness exists all around us, and life springs from it. Every situation we are in, even the most mundane, has the capacity for life in it. (Page 55)
- One aspect of this structure is the "wabitosabi" of Zen teaching: the Japanese concept of beauty which is best translated as "rusty beauty." These things are all beautiful, but they are all damaged. Life itself is damaged, and nothing which is perfect can be truly alive. (Page 60)
- What impresses us about all these examples is that they have a kind of blitheness or serenity, an innocent and simple quality. Their depth is not a mechanical composition: there is a truth, an easiness, about many of these things. Their easiness takes the breath away. They arrive at a simplicity and truthfulness which ring an echo in us-sometimes perhaps even make us weak in the knees. Somehow these works remind us of the essence of life. They have a simplicity beyond artifice.' (Page 60)
- The quality of life includes us, as human beings. A place which has the deepest life is one in which I reach a deeper level of life inside my self, and in my spirit. The quality of life which I attain-its depth-in any given building is part of the way I experience that building. (Page 61)
- I claim that this quality is not merely the basis for a distinction between beautiful things and ugly things. It is something which is detectable as a subtle distinction in every corner of the world, as we walk about, in the most ordinary places, during the most ordinary events. It is a quality which changes from place to place and from moment to moment, and which marks, in varying degrees, every moment, every event, every point in space. (Page 64)
- I state this by means of the following hypothesis: _What we call "life" is a general condition which exists, to some degree or other, in every part of space: brick, stone, grass, river, painting, building, daffodil, human being, forest, city. And further: The key to this idea is that every part of space-every connected region of space, small or large - has some degree of life, and that this degree of life is well defined, objectively existing, and measurable._ (Page 77)
- Intuitively we may guess that the beauty of a life building, its life, and its capacity to support all come from the fact that it is working as a whole. A view of the building as a whole means that we see it as part of an extended and undivided continuum. It is not an isolated fragment in itself, but part of the world which includes the gardens, walls, trees, streets beyond its boundaries, and other buildings beyond those. And it contains many wholes within it-also unbounded and continuous in their connections. Above all, the whole is unbroken and undivided. (Page 80)
- In all these examples, the wholeness is the important thing: the local parts exist chiefly in relation to the whole, and their behavior and character and structure are determined by the larger whole in which they exist and which they create. (Page 80)
- The general idea is that the wholeness in any part of space is the structure defined by all the various coherent entities that exist in that part of space, and the way these entities are nested in and overlap each other. (Page 81)
- The entities which come into existence in a configuration are not merely cognitive. They have a real mathematical existence, and are actually occurring features _of the space itself._ They may be established mathematically according to the relative hierarchies of differentiation in the space. They are mathematically and physically _real._
  And they have different degrees of strength (Page 83)
- This apparent paradox (seeming paradoxical only because of the simpleminded way in which it is expressed) is a fundamental issue in the nature of wholeness: the wholeness is made of parts; the parts are created by the wholeness. To understand wholeness we must have a conception in which "parts" and wholes work in this holistic way. (Page 84)
- To have a consistent way of talking about these entities, during recent years, I have learned to call them all (whether parts or or local wholes or hardly visible coherent entities), "centers." What this means is that each one of these entities has, as its defining mark, _the fact that it appears to exist as a local center within a larger whole._ (Page 84)
- In using the word center in this way, I am not referring at all to a point center like a center of gravity. I use the word center to identify an organized zone of space - that is to say, a distinct set of points in space, which, because of its organization, because of its internal coherence, and because of its relation to its context, _exhibits centeredness,_ forms a local zone of relative centeredness with respect to the other parts of space. _When I use the word center, I am always referring to a physical set, a distinct physical system, which occupies a certain volume in space, and has a special marked coherence._ Even when the center is a social or cultural center, it is still ultimately spatial as well: it occurs in space, and always has a spatial locus. (Page 84)
- The same is true of all the entities which appear in the world. When I think of them as wholes, or entities, I focus on their boundedness, their separation. When I think of them as centers, I become more aware of their relatedness; I see them as focal points in a larger unbroken whole and I see the world as whole. (Page 85)
- Thus the strength of any given center is not merely a function of the internal shape which creates that center in itself, but comes about as a result of the influence of many other factors e which extend outward in the given region of space, always as a result of the configuration _as a whole._ (Page 85)
- The wholeness in any given part of space is highly fluid, and easily affected by very small changes of geometry. Indeed wholeness changes continuously through time, and is dependent on subtle ― sometimes even minute - changes in the configurations in it and around it. This happens because the centers which occur are induced in a very subtle fashion, and therefore change quite markedly as even small changes are made in the fine structure of the configuration (Page 86)
- Thus it is clear that the wholeness is a structure of great subtlety _which is induced in the whole._ It cannot easily be predicted from the parts, _and it is useless to think of it as a relationship "among the parts."_ The wholeness is an autonomous and global structure, which is induced by the details of the configuration. It is a real physical and mathematical structure in space but it is created indirectly, by symmetries and other relationships which are induced in the geometry. To grasp the nature of this subtle structure fully, we must learn to avoid the danger of trying to see centers made up of parts. (Page 86)
- I believe accurate understanding of wholeness is quite different. When we understand what wholeness is really like as a structure, we see that in most cases it is the wholeness which creates its parts. The center is not made from parts. Rather, it would be more true to say that most of the parts are created by the wholeness. They settle out from the wholeness, and are created by all of it. (Page 86)
- When we understand things in their wholeness, this is the general rule. The sub-wholesor centers - are induced within the wholeness, and come from the wholeness. And because of this, the parts are adapted and modified, in shape and size, by their position within the whole. The petals of a flower are not identical. They are similar, but each one is slightly different according to its position and history in the whole. When parts repeat we never have identical repetition. Instead we have repeated parts as centers which are changing and variable according to their position in the whole, as they repeat within the whole. (Page 87)
- In this new vision, it is always the whole, the wholeness as a structure, which comes first Everything else follows from this wholeness, and from the centers and sub-centers which are induced within it. (Page 88)
- What exactly, then, _is_ wholeness? That is the crux of the matter. My answer is that the wholeness is not merely a way of focusing on the gestalt of the thing, but is instead a real structure, an actual "thing" in itself. It is a structure which exists in the world that includes what we intuitively perceive as the gestalt, the overview, the _broad_ nature of a thing. It is the source of the coherence which exists in any part of the world.
  This wholeness gets its strength from the coherent spatial centers of which it is made. (Page 90)
- The coherent centers define character, and create arrangement. The main coherent centers which exist in a place determine what it is like there, what kind of life it has. The centers are the most fundamental things we notice in what is happening. They affect us most. (Page 90)
- _The wholeness of any portion of the world is this system of larger and smaller centers, in their connection and overlap.& (Page 90)
- When we see wholeness as it is, we recognize that these seeming parts- the road, the tree, the bike, these particular centers-are merely arbitrary fragments which our minds have been directed to, because we happen to have _words_ for them. (Page 92)
- We shall not understand how the world works unless we pay attention to the structure of wholeness as it is. (Page 93)
- Although one may be misled into thinking about design, the features which design seems to deal with are minor, have less importance. The centers― the coherent entities which form the whole-are life-affirming, massive in their effect, and tremendously concrete, so that minor changes in design could not sway them, or upset them, or change them. (Page 94)
- Thus the centers we notice when we see the situation in its wholeness are not only more dominant to the eye. _They control the real behavior of the thing, the life which develops there, the real human events which happen, and the feelings people have about living there._ (Page 95)
- _I propose a view of physical reality which is dominated by the existence of this one particular structure, W, the wholeness. In any given region of space, some subregions have higher intensity as centers, others have less. Many subregions have weak intensity or none at all. The overall configuration of the nested centers, together with their relative intensities, comprise a single structure. I define this structure as "the" wholeness of that region._ (Page 96)
- A crucial feature of the wholeness is that it is neutral: it simply exists. Determination of its details may be made by neutral methods, yet at the same time--as we shall see in later chapters - the relative harmony or "life" of a given building may be understood directly from the internal cohesion of the structure. Thus, the relative life or beauty or goodness of a given part of the world may be understood, I shall argue, without reference to opinion, prejudice or philosophy, _merely as a consequence of the wholeness which exists._ (Page 96)
- This definition makes it clear how much the wholeness is a global thing - easy to feel, perhaps, but hard to define. You cannot get the por trait of a person right unless you can see this underlying wholeness, this underlying inner character. Drawing the features correctly does not necessarily achieve a resemblance. How many artists, in their first attempts at portraihave found this out, in frustration? If you want to draw a person, you _have_ to draw the wholeness. Nothing else will get the likeness.
  ture, 20 In portraiture, as in architecture, it is the wholeness which is the real thing that lies beneath the surface, and determines everything. (Page 98)
- In human society, the wholeness of a given part of space always includes the cultural milieu. In India, the wholeness includes the pervasive existence of centers in which people sit, squat, sleep on the ground. In America this would be an aberration, for which a person might be arrested. (Page 103)
- I believe that _all_ centers that appear in space space whether they originate in biology, in physical forces, in pure geometry, in color — _are_ alike simply in that they all animate space. It is this animated space that has its functional effect upon the world, that determines the way things work, that governs the presence of harmony and life. (Page 106)
- So this neutral wholeness, which lies under the surface of every place, at every time, in buildings, meadows, streets - is the natural origin of life. Life comes from it. Life comes from the particular details of the ways the centers in the wholeness cohere to form a unity, the ways they interact, and interlock, and influence each other. (Page 106)
- What I would like to demonstrate is the way that the creation of life is possible, and how it is done. There are four key ideas, all arising from the structure of centers described in chapter 3:
  1. Centers themselves have life.
  2. Centers help one another: the existence and life of one center can intensify the life of another.
  3. Centers are made of centers (this is the only way of describing their composition).
  4. A structure gets its life according to the density and intensity of centers which have been formed in it.
  These four points, simple as they are, give us the secret of living structure, and of the way life comes from wholeness. (Page 110)
- _The crux of the matter is this: a center is a kind of entity which can only be defined in terms of other centers._ The idea of a center cannot be defined in terms of any other primitive entities _except centers._ (Page 116)
- However, we may say this: in many of the examples shown, the key centers are symmetrical. Indeed, to a first approximation, one may identify the centers in a field as emanating from those entities which are convex, bounded, and roughly symmetrical, and differentiated from their surroundings. 10 Some centers roughly follow these rules. But the rules are only approximate. A few of the centers and subcenters which appear in the carpet ornament are shown on the right. Some are imperfectly symmetrical. Some are not convex. Some are mainly defined by the degree to which they are differentiated from their surroundings, not by symmetry or boundedness at all. Nevertheless, as a rough rule of thumb, we may keep hold of the idea that centers are coherent entities, often marked by local symmetry, by differentiation, by the presence of a boundary, and by convexity, which cooperate to cause a field effect.11 (Page 121)
- We do this by adding other centers. But we add the other centers very carefully to be sure that they work to intensify the center of the column.
  Once we have done this, we have more centers than before. We have an emerging field of centers. The process is not additive: it is transformative. At each step, we do not add things, but transform the previous version, as a whole, to give it more centeredness, as a whole, by inducing more centers to intensify those that exist already. (Page 129)
- I have introduced the idea of life as something which may occur in any spatial system, and suggested that the degree of life which appears in a thing depends on the life of its component centers and their density. Thus, broadly, we have a theoretical scheme in which the life of a thing, or building, or system, depends on the extent to which the centers in this thing cohere and help each other. (Page 144)
- managed to identify fifteen structural features which appear again and again in things which do have life.¹ These are: I. LEVELS OF SCALE, 2. STRONG CENTERS, 3. BOUNDARIES, ALTERNATING REPETITION, 5. POSITIVE SPACE, 6. GOOD SHAPE, 7. LOCAL SYMMETRIES, 8. DEEP INTERLOCK AND AMBIGUITY, 9. CONTRAST, IO. GRADIENTS, II. ROUGHNESS, 12. ECHOES, 13. THE VOID, 14. SIMPLICITY AND INNER CALM, 15. NOT-SEPARATENESS. (Page 144)
- During those many years of observation, I often asked myself what these fifteen properties signified, what they are, what they do. And finally, I came to understand that all of them are, in effect, just the fifteen ways in which centers can help each other come to life. I came to understand that they work, they make things have life, because they are the ways in which centers can help each other in space. (Page 145)
- The first thing I noticed, when I began to study objects which have life, was that they all contain different scales. In my new language, I would now say that the centers these objects are made of tend to have a beautiful range of sizes, and that these sizes exist at a series of well-marked levels, with definite jumps between them. In short, there are big centers, middle-sized centers, small centers, and very small centers. (Page 148)
- If the jumps in scale are heavy, deliberate, and somewhat evenly spaced through the levels of scale, a thing will often have this powerful life. (Page 148)
- Throughout these examples we see that a center becomes most intense in its life when other centers near it have a definite size relation to it at a scale which is perhaps half its size, or twice its size-but not enormously bigger, or enormously smaller. To intensify a given center, we need to make another center perhaps half or quarter the size of the first. If the smaller one is less than one-tenth of the larger one it is less likely to help it in its intensity. (Page 148)
- As in this example, every strong center is made of many other strong centers, a multiplicity of centers. Like levels of scale, the concept of a strong center is recursive; it does not refer to some one grand center, but to the fact that at a great variety of scales, in a thing which is alive, we can feel the presence of a center, and that it is this multiplicity of different centers, at different levels, which engages us.
  In many cases there is nevertheless one principal center, the center of the whole composition - the resting place, the middle, the most important place. In other cases which are equally breathtaking, there is no one center, but an undulating series of minor centers, as in the deer on the plate shown on the facing page. But even in cases like these we see, at various points, things which we can identify as "centers," forming and making other centers powerful and strong. (Page 156)
- The purpose of the boundary which surrounds a center is two-fold. First, it focuses attention on the center and thus helps to produce the center. It does this by forming the field of force which creates and intensifies the center which is bounded. Second, it unites the center which is being bounded with the world beyond the boundary. For this to happen, the boundary must at the same time be distinct from the center being bounded, must keep this center distinct and separate from the world beyond it, and yet also have the capacity of uniting that center with the world beyond the boundary. Then the boundary both unites and separates. In both ways, the center that is bounded becomes more intense. (Page 159)
- Boundaries do the complex work of surrounding, enclosing, separating, and connecting in various different geometric ways, but one vital feature is necessary in order to make the boundary work in any of these ways: the boundary needs to be of the same order of magnitude as the center which is being bounded. If the boundary is very much smaller than the thing being bounded, it can't do much to hold in or form the center. A two-inch border cannot hold a threefoot field (Page 159)
- There is a further point. Taken by itself, the boundary rule seems simple. But the rule does not merely refer to the outer boundary of the thing. If we apply the rule repeatedly, it every part, at every level, has a boundary which is a thing in its own right. This includes the boundaries themselves. They too have boundaries, each of which is a thing in its own right. What seems like one rule, then, is a pervasive structural feature of enormous depth, which is in effect applied dozens or hundreds of times, at different scales throughout the thing. (Page 162)
- One of the ways that centers help each other most effectively is by their repetition. Centers intensify other centers by repeating. The rhythm of the repeating center, slowly, like the beat of a drum, intensifies the field effect. (Page 165)
- But the repetition which occurs in things which have life is a very special kind of repetition. It is a kind where the rhythm of the centers that repeat is underlined, and intensified, by an alternating rhythm interlocked with the first and where a second system of centers also repeats, in parallel. The second system of centers then intensifies the first system, by providing a kind of counterpoint, or opposing beat (Page 165)
- Of course, in many cases where a structure gets intense life from repetition the repetition tends to be inexact; it is then the subtle variation which comes with the repetition that is satisfying and lifegiving. This happens because the elements are not identical, but modified, each according to its position in the whole, creating a subtle variation in the repetition (Page 169)
- More exactly, it seems that what is really happening is not repetition, but oscillation.
  The thing repeats like a wave — one, then the other, then the one again, and so on. (Page 171)
- Whenever centers repeat within a structure, they will generally unite to intensify a larger center only when a second system of centers is inserted in between them, forming a second alternating system, sometimes even creating a third system of centers mutually caused by the first two, which once again ripple and alternate and oscillate. (Page 171)
- What I call POSITIVE SPACE occurs when every bit of space swells outward, is substantial in itself, is never the leftover from an adjacent shape. We may see it like ripening corn, each kernel swelling until it meets the others, each one having its own positive shape caused by its growth as a cell from the inside.
  My observations have led me to believe that in almost anything, large or small, the extent to which every single part is positive is fundamental to its life and wholeness. A work of art has life more or less to the extent that every single one of its component parts and spaces is whole, wellshaped and positive. Of all the properties which create life in space, this is probably the most simple and the most essential, since it is this one which guarantees to every part of space the status of being a relatively strong center. (Page 173)
- The definition of positive space is straightforward: every single part of space has positive shape as a center. There are no amorphous meaningless leftovers. Every shape is a strong center, and every space is made up in such a way that it only has strong centers in its space, nothing else besides. (Page 176)
- It took me a long time to see that good shape itself is also related to the centers; and that, indeed, a shape we see as good is a shape which is _itself,_ as a shape, made up from multiple coherent centers. (Page 179)
- Wherever there is a local symmetry, there tends to be a center. Where a living center forms, it is often necessary to have some local symmetry.
  However, the exact relation between life and symmetry is muddy. Living things, though often symmetrical, rarely have perfect symmetry. Indeed, perfect symmetry is often a mark of death in things, rather than life. (Page 186)
- In general, a large symmetry of the simplified neoclassicist type rarely contributes to the life of a thing, because in any complex whole in the world, there are nearly always complex, asymmetrical forces at work-matters of location, and context, and function-which require that symmetry be broken. (Page 187)
- Why does the presence of many local symmetries in the design make it coherent and memorable? It is as if the symmetrical segments act as a kind of glue-the glue which holds the space together. The more glue there is, the more the space is one, solid, unified, coherent. And notice one more detail: for the glue to be effective, it seems that many of the symmetrical segments must overlap. They are by no means discrete or disjoint. One symmetrical segment overlaps another — and it is not only the number of symmetrical segments, but also their continuous overlapping which makes the glue that makes the design "whole." (Page 191)
- What is the relation between symmetries and centers? How do symmetries allow centers to intensify each other? In many cases, a symme try is used to establish an elementary center. Indeed, an overwhelming majority of centers are locally symmetrical. Each local symmetry establishes a symmetry between two smaller centers to create a larger center. Indeed, one might almost say, "When in doubt, make it symmetrical." Most centers become stronger when symmetrical, except, of course, that symmetries must not be used to smooth out real asymmetries in external conditions, and must always be true to the local conditions. (Page 193)
- In a surprisingly large number of cases, living structures contain some form of interlock: situations where centers are "hooked" into their surroundings. This has the effect of making it difficult to disentangle the center from its surroundings. It becomes more deeply unified with the world and with other centers near it. (Page 195)
- Another feature I have found repeatedly in works of art which have great life is a surprisingly intense CONTRAST-far more contrast than one imagines would be helpful or even possible to sustain. The following examples show contrast at its extreme.
  Life cannot occur without differentiation. Unity can only be created from distinctness. This means, that every center is made from discernible opposites, and intensified when the not center, against which it is opposed, is clarified, and itself becomes a center. The "opposites" take many forms. But in all of them, contrast of some kind is visible. And in order for the thing to be truly whole, the contrast has to be pronounced. Black-white and dark-light contrast are the most common kinds. Empty-full, solid-void, busy-silent, red-green, and blue-yellow are all possible forms of contrast, too. However, the most important contrasts do not merely show variety of form (high-low, soft-hard, rough-smooth, and so on) but represent true opposites, which essentially annihilate each other when they are superimposed. In some sense, it is the contrast awareness of silence created by a hand-clap which is going on here. The difference between opposites gives birth to something. This is the origin of yin-yang, active-passive, light-dark. (Page 200)
- For functional and cognitive clarity, contrast is also practically necessary: the shop in the neighborhood is different from the houses next to it. The front door is different from the back door. The roof is different from the wall. The kitchen is different from the living room. The light in the bedroom is different from the light in the passage. In case after case evidence suggests that the sharp extended and visible differences between things which are different allows each center to take its proper nature. It permits more intensive attention to individual functions. And it creates a feeling of distinction which relaxes people, because it acknowledges and permits different dimensions of experience (Page 203)
- Contrast is the thing which creates differentiation, and allows differentiation. It is the differentiation of the void which gives birth to matter. All differentiation requires that contrast is created in space, in order to give birth to anything at all. (Page 203)
- You have noticed, I am sure, that almost anything which has real life has a certain softness. Qualities vary, slowly, subtly, gradually, across the extent of each thing. GRADIENTS Occur. One quality changes slowly across space, and becomes another.
  Gradients must arise in the world when the world is in harmony with itself simply because conditions vary. Qualities vary, so centers which are adapted to them respond by varying in size, spacing, intensity, and character. (Page 205)
- In something which has life, there are graded fields of variation throughout the whole, often moving from the center to the boundary, or from the boundary to the center. Indeed, gradients are essentially and necessarily connected to the existence of a living center. Almost always the strengthened field-like character of the center is caused, in part, by the fact that an organization of smaller centers creates gradients which "point to" some new and larger virtual center. Sometimes the arrows and gradients set up in the field give the center its primary strength. (Page 207)
- The reason that this roughness in the design contributes so greatly to the wholeness of the bowl is that a perfect triangular grid of the kind used here, cannot be made to fill a spherical surface properly. If the design were composed of identical units, identically placed, it would break down, and there would be really difficult problems where the grid became tighter toward the center of the bowl. (Page 210)
- All the examples show how the seemingly rough solution which seems superficially _in_accurate― is in fact _more_ precise, not less so, because it comes about as a result of paying attention to what matters most, and letting go of what matters less. As the power of this completed carpet clearly shows, a perfect corner does not matter nearly as much as the correct balance and positive space in the border. _The seemingly rough arrangement is more precise because it comes from a much more careful guarding of the essential centers in the design._ (Page 211)
- Going back to the more fundamental meaning of the property of "roughness," a person can only allow the regularity or order of a situation to be let loose, according to the wholeness which is required, when he or she is in this very special state of mind, this egolessness, which allows each part to be made exactly as it needs to be. Roughness does not seek to superimpose an arbitrary order over a design, but instead lets the larger order be relaxed, modified according to the demands and constraints which happen locally in different parts of the design. (Page 213)
- By paying attention to the global structure only to the extent that is needed, a much more fresh and vital line comes into being. (Page 214)
- In the course of examining things which have profound life, I have found that there is almost always one vital characteristic, very hard to describe accurately, and yet crucial. In general terms, there is a deep underlying similarity― a family resemblance-among the elements, so deep that everything seems to be related, and yet one doesn't quite know why, or what causes it. That is what I mean by "ECHOES." Echoes, as far as I can tell, depend on the angles, and families of angles, which are prevalent in the design.
  When echoes are present, the various smaller elements and centers, from which the larger centers are made, are all members of the same family; they contain echoes of one another; there are deep internal similarities between them which tie them together to form a single unity. (Page 218)
- In the most profound centers which have perfect wholeness, there is at the heart a void which is like water, infinite in depth, surrounded by and contrasted with the clutter of the stuff and fabric all around it. (Page 222)
- This emptiness is needed, in some form, by every center, large or small. It is the quiet that draws the center's energy to itself, gives it the basis of its strength. (Page 225)
- Wholeness, life, has a way of being always simple. In most cases, this simplicity shows itself in a geometrical simplicity and purity, which has a tangible geometrical form.
  It is a quality rather rare in carpets, but more common in other great works of art which is essential to the completion of the whole. It has to do with a certain slowness, majesty, quietness, which I think of as inner calm. (Page 226)
- The quality comes about when everything unnecessary is removed. All centers that are not actively supporting other centers are stripped out, cut out, excised. What is left, when boiled away, is the structure in a state of inner calm. It is essential that the great beauty and intricacy of ornament go only just far enough to bring this calm into being, and not so far that it destroys it. (Page 226)
- The last of these properties—ultimately perhaps the most significant—is NOT-SEPARATENESS, connectedness. What not-separateness means, quite simply, is that we experience a living whole as being at one with the world and not separate from it—according to its degree of wholeness. (Page 230)
- Let me summarize in structural terms what this property is all about. It states that any center which has deep life is connected, in feeling, to what surrounds it, and is not cut off, isolated, or separated. In a center which is deeply coherent there is a lack of separation - instead a profound connection between that center and the other centers which surround it, so that the various centers melt into one another and become inseparable. _It is that quality which comes about from each center, to the degree it is connected to the whole world._ (Page 231)
- The correct connection to the world will only be made if you are conscious, willing, that the thing you make be indistinguishable from its surroundings; that, truly, you cannot tell where one ends and the next begins, and you do not even want to be able to do so. (Page 233)
- The structural feature which is perhaps most responsible for the easy, healed feeling of not-separateness is lack of abruptness, of sharpness. A thing which has this quality feels completely at peace because it is so deeply connected to the world around it. This quality, geometrically, depends especially on the state of the boundary. In things which have have notseparateness, there is often a fragmented boundary, an incomplete edge, which destroys the hard line. (Page 234)
- They are, if you like, fifteen ways of talking about centers, and the way that the existence and life of centers dominates the existence of life in the world.
  I. LEVELS OF SCALE is the way that a strong center is made stronger partly by smaller strong centers contained in it, and partly by its larger strong centers which contain it.
  2. STRONG CENTERS defines the way that a strong center requires a special fieldlike effect, created by other centers, as the primary source of its strength.
  3. BOUNDARIES is the way in which the fieldlike effect of a center is strengthened by the creation of a ringlike center, made of smaller centers which surround and intensify the first.
  The boundary also unites the center with the centers beyond it, thus strengthening it further.
  4. ALTERNATING REPETITION is the way in which centers are strengthened when they repeat, by the insertion of other centers between the repeating ones.
  5. POSITIVE SPACE is the way that a given center must draw its strength, in part, from the strength of other centers immediately adjacent to it in space.
  6. GOOD SHAPE is the way that the strength of a given center depends on its actual shape, and the way this effect requires that even the shape, its boundary, and the space around it are made up of strong centers.
  7. LOCAL SYMMETRIES is the way that the intensity of a given center is increased by the extent to which other smaller centers which it contains are themselves arranged in locally symmetrical groups.
  8. DEEP INTERLOCK AND AMBIGUITY is the way in which the intensity of a given center can be increased when it is attached to nearby strong centers, through a third set of strong centers that ambiguously belong to both.
  9. CONTRAST is the way that a center is strengthened by the sharpness of the distinction between its character and the character of surrounding centers.
  10. GRADIENTS is the way in which a center is strengthened by a graded series of differentsized centers which then "point" to the new center and intensify its field effect.
  11. ROUGHNESS is the way that the field effect of a given center draws its strength, necessarily, from irregularities in the sizes, shapes and arrangements of other nearby centers.
  12. ECHOES is the way that the strength of a given center depends on similarities of angle and orientation and systems of centers forming characteristic angles thus forming larger centers, among the centers it contains.
  13. THE VOID is the way that the intensity of every center depends on the existence of a still place an empty center-somewhere in its field.
  14. SIMPLICITY AND INNER CALM is the way the strength of a center depends on its simplicity-on the process of reducing the number of different centers which exist in it, while increasing the strength of these centers to make them weigh more.
  15. NOT-SEPARATENESS is the way the life and strength of a center depends on the extent to which that center is merged smoothly-sometimes even indistinguishably-with the centers that form its surroundings. (Page 239)
- Not-separateness corresponds to the fact that there is no perfect isolation of any system, and that each part of every system is always part of the larger systems in the world around it and is connected to them deeply in its behavior. (Page 288)
- Simplicity and inner calm is the Occam's razor of any natural system: each configuration occurring in nature is the simplest one consistent with its conditions. (Page 289)
- But I do observe, for the present, that, for whatever reason, boundaries contribute to the stability and coherence of natural systems. For similar systemreasons-so my argument goes--the other fourteen properties, too, tend to appear in almost any natural system which is functionally stable or semistable, contributing in some way to its coherence and stability. Each of the fifteen properties does something of a characteristic nature to maintain the integrity and viability of natural systems. The appearance of these properties is linked to the stability and robustness, of the world.
  That is because these properties represent the most fundamental ways in which space can be molded to form character, to create form, to form unique structure that is capable of having properties, behavior, and interesting or useful interactions with other structures. (Page 292)
- A world-view based on the existence of wholeness comes out rather different. If the field of centers is a governing structure which underlies all physical reality, then there is a crucial objective sense in which there is _less_ value in the empty space, _somewhat more_ value in the rock, and still _more_ value in the birch tree. (Page 294)
- Once people appear on the planet, the difference becomes sharply accentuated. Most human actions are governed by concepts and visions. These may be - but may easily not be congruent with the wholeness which exists. Under the influence of concepts, it becomes harder and harder for us to remain in harmony with the emerging wholeness. Often our actions, intentionally or unintentionally, are at odds with our own wholeness, and at odds with the wholeness of the world. The gradual emergence of value is then drastically threatened. (Page 295)
- In our era, this situation has become acute. We may recognize that the world is a system in which deep wholeness can occur as an objective matter of fact. But it does not necessarily occur. The activity of building-what we call architecture, and with it also the disciplines we call planning, ecology, agriculture, forestry, road building, engineering-may reach deeper levels of value by increasing wholeness, or they may break down value by destroying wholeness. This is not a stylistic observation, or a culturally induced opinion, depending on a point of view. If what I have argued is true, this is a matter of fact about the wholeness in the world. Life will increase, or it will degenerate, according to the degree in which the wholeness of the world is upheld, or damaged, by human beings and human processes. (Page 295)
- Rather it turns out that living structure is at once both structural and personal. It is related to the geometry of space and to how things work. And it is related to the human person, deeply attached to something in ourselves, even emanating perhaps from ourselves, in any case inextricably connected with what we are, who we are, how we feel ourselves to be as individuals and persons, beings whose lives are ultimately based on feeling.
  This revelation — and after seeing what I have to say about it you may agree, I hope, that it is a revelation — means that the nature of order as I have defined it, in principle at least can finally bridge the gap that Alfred North Whitehead called "the bifurcation of nature." It unites the objective and subjective, it shows us that order as the foundation of all things (and, not so incidentally, as the foundation of all architecture, too) is both rooted in substance and rooted in feeling, is at once objective in a scientific sense, yet also substantial in the sense of poetry, in the sense of the feelings which make us human, which make us in secret and vulnerable thoughts, just what we are. (Page 298)
- When the field of centers is authentic, it is always personal. If it appears to have the right structure but is not personal, it is empty structure, only masquerading as life- and, in every case like this, it will turn out that we have misjudged it _structurally_. The existence of a personal feeling in a thing or system is not a subjective quality of limited validity, but an objective quality whose existence is as fundamental to any given situation as the more mechanical facts to which we are accustomed. (Page 301)
- This deep feeling is indeed a _mark_ of life in things. It is, from a human point of view, perhaps the most important aspect of life in buildings because because it is the aspect which connects that life, most directly, and most wonderfully, with our own existence, with what it is to be alive. And it shows us that the life in buildings, which makes them work, which makes them alive in _themselves_, also is connected to _us_, is _personal_. (Page 308)
- Further, and very fundamentally stated, _we become happy in the presence of deep wholeness_. When I am in a building which has life, I have a happiness in me, a comforting and profound wholesomeness. Unlike those structures pursued by science, which are remote from us and have only mechanical reality, the field of centers is somehow part of us, connected with the very essence of being human (Page 308)
    - Note: This is appealing but this also doesn't reconcile the idea that wholeness is an objective thing but that very different things make people happy.
- I believe the personal feeling I have touched on in this chapter, which is directly connected to order and life, is a mobilization in which my vulnerable inner self becomes connected to the world. It increases my feeling of connection and participation in all things. It is feeling, not emotion. It does not — directly — have to do with happiness, or sadness, or anger.
  Rather, it is the feeling of being part of the ocean, part of the sky, part of the asphalt on the road. (Page 309)
- Once we recognize that feeling and life are somehow one and the same thing, and that the structure we call wholeness is connected with a ground where matter becomes personal, then we begin to see the depth of the revolution in thought to which the idea of wholeness leads. The external phenomenon we call wholeness or life in the world and the internal experience of personal feeling and wholeness within ourselves are connected. They are, at some level, one and the same thing. (Page 309)
- When we experience something which has deep wholeness, it increases our own wholesomeness. The deeper the wholeness or life which we meet in the world, the more deeply it affects our own personal feeling. Centers which have life increase our own life because we ourselves are centers too. We feel more wholesome in the presence of things which have wholesomeness in them, because we, like other centers, are intensified by them. (Page 312)
- But at the bottom of all this, there is still a puzzling question, the question of the life of the centers _themselves_. The actual life _itself_ which any given center possesses, its degree of life, is still not entirely clear as a concept. We cannot easily avoid the idea that space itself has the power to come to life — a center is an emerging spot of life in the material substance of space itself. This is disturbing, or at least surprising, because it is inconsistent with most modern interpretations of physics. But even if we want to accept it, we still don't really know what it means. _What is it?_ What is this thing which happens as space comes to life? What is the life of a center, which then multiplies and blossoms to form the life of buildings, ornaments... and perhaps even the life of living things? (Page 314)
- We shall see, in the following chapters, that this situation is changed in the world-picture which I propose. In this new world-picture, based on wholeness and the structure of centers, the connection between the outer or objective world and my experience of the self is profound and immediate. It makes sense. It is pervasive. It is direct. (Page 314)
- However, the surprising, and the important, thing is that the mirror-of-the-self test does not correspond to our everyday sense of what we like. When we really concentrate on the life in things by checking how much self they have, we find that sometimes, yes, the test does confirm our liking, or our preference. But at other times, it gives us quite different results, which are not stereotypes of good design but which surprise us, shock us out of our complacency, and make us recognize that we are confronted here with an autonomous phenomenon, that has a great deal to teach us. (Page 314)
- As it turns out, the relation of the outer (and objective) wholeness to the inner (and subjective) self, and the empirical methods needed to establish degree of life in different places, are deeply connected. They turn out, indeed, to be two facets of one and the same idea. It hinges on the question: what kind of judgment are we making when we see that one thing has a greater degree of life than another? (Page 315)
- On the other hand, real liking, which does come from the heart, is profoundly linked to the idea of life in things. Liking something from the heart means that it makes us more whole in ourselves. It has a healing effect on us. It makes us more human. It even increases the life in _us_. (Page 315)
- 1. The things we like (from the heart) make us feel wholesome when we are near them.
  2. We also feel wholesome when we are making these things. As we make them, and after making them, we feel whole in ourselves, healed, and right with the world.
  3. The more accurate we are about what we really like, in this sense of liking from the heart, the more we find out that we agree with other people about which these things are.
  4. What we like from the heart coincides with the objective structure of wholeness or life in a thing. As we get to know the "it" which we like from the heart, we begin to see that this is the deepest thing there is. It applies to all judgments—not just about buildings and works of art, but also about actions, people, everything.
  5. There is an empirical way in which we can help ourselves to find out what we really like from the heart. Nevertheless, it is not easy to find what we really like, and it is by no means automatic to be in touch with it. It takes effort, hard work, and personal enlightenment to understand it and to feel it. It requires liberation from opinions and concepts and ego to experience deep liking.
  6. The reasons for the existence of this deep liking are mysterious, not obvious. To plumb them we shall have to examine the nature of things—even ultimately, the nature of matter itself—very carefully. Nevertheless the reasons are empirical. We may determine, empirically, to what extent a thing has the ability to rouse this deep liking in us. It is not a private matter?
  7. Somehow, the experience of real liking has to do with self. As we find out which things awaken real liking in ourselves, we find ourselves more in touch than before with our own selves.
  8. When we find out the things we really like, we are also more in touch with all that is. (Page 315)
- In the method of observation which I prothe observer asks to what degree each of the pose, two things we are trying to judge is, or is not, a picture of the self- and by this I mean your and my wholesome self, perhaps even our eternal self. (Page 316)
- Other, more general tests are more robust, and easier to use. I find that for daily use, the one that works best is the question: "Comparing A and B, which one makes me feel the most wholeness in myself, which allows me to come closest to my own life, which makes me experience life most deeply?" It is not always easy to answer this question, but it is usually possible. (Page 354)
- Which of the two seems to generate a greater feeling of life in me?
  Which of the two makes me more aware of my own life?
  Which of the two induces (as asked in Akido) a greater harmony in me, in my body and in my mind?
  Which of the two makes me feel a greater wholesomeness in myself?
  Considering my self as a whole that embraces all my dimensions and many internal opposites, I then ask which of the two is more like my best self, or which of the two seems more like a picture of my eternal self?
  Which of the two makes me feel devotion, or inspires devotion in me?
  Which of the two makes me more aware of God, or makes me feel closer to God? 2 . When I try to observe the expanding and contracting of my humanity, which of the two causes a greater expansion of my humanity?
  Which of the two has more feeling in it or, more accurately, which of the two makes me experience a deeper feeling of unity in myself? (Page 355)
- These things are happening in each of us all the time. At each instant, as I go through the world, because of what happens to me, and because of what I do, my humanity is expanding and diminishing all the time; sometimes for an instant it is a little greater, sometimes for an instant it is a little smaller. (Page 356)
- If we have a sound, and clear basis for making decisions about what is good and what is bad, what is better and what worse, we can then move through the days of decision making successfully, and we shall have good results. But at present, we have no such tool. We have opinions, certainly. But no reliable source of judgment, that we can truly stand upon. And as a result, each architect, each designer, is a little lost, mentally flailing around trying to do a good job without being sure what that means- all because we have a foundation of quicksand for the judgments he/she/we are called upon to make every moment of the working day. (Page 364)
- It is vital to understand that the ultimate goal in these observations is observation of the _system in the world_, not observation of the observer's reaction. If we compare two mountain streams by checking the degree of wholeness which the observers experience in themselves when in the presence of these streams, it is the degree of life, wholeness, and ecological health of the systems-that is, _of the living streams themselves_ which is being measured, not the satisfaction of the observers. (Page 364)
- I shall argue that the geometry of the physical world-its space its space has the most profound impact possible on human beings: it has impact on the most important of all human qualities, our inner freedom, or the sense of life each person has. It touches on internal freedom, freedom of the spirit. (Page 372)
- Those environments which are composed of living centers, which meet the functional conditions described in chapter 7, which meet the extraordinary mirror of the self test, and thus reflect the human self, which do this in accordance with culture and society, and which have the fifteen properties working to support human existence― these places are the ones where we feel most free. Those environments which lack this structure are ones where we feel- and may easily become - dead. (Page 372)
- A healthy human being is able, essentially, to solve problems, to develop, to move toward objects of desire, to contribute to the well-being of others in society, to create value in the world, and to love, to be exhilarated, to enjoy. The capacity to do these many positive things, to do them well, and to do them freely, is natural. It arises by itself. It cannot be created artificially in a person, but it needs to be released, given room. It does need to be supported. It depends, simply, on the degree to which a person is able to concentrate on these things, not on others. And this steady-mindedness, even in joy, is damaged by the extent to which other unresolved or unresolvable conflicts take up mental and physical space in the person's daily life. (Page 373)
- Let us now come to the topic of human freedom. It will be accepted, I think, that the best environment would be one in which each person can become as alive as possible that is as vibrant intellectually, physically, morally-and in which people can reach, as far as possible, their own potential as human beings. One may assume, too, that each person naturally does everything possible, to be alive. The tendency to enjoy life, seek life, live life to the fullest, is a natural human force. It is the thing a person most naturally aspires to, and seeks. (Page 374)
- Finally, at the end, and having by-passed all the obvious definitions of freedom, having exhausted all the other definitions he can think of, Wertheimer's protagonist concludes that true freedom lies in the ability a person has to react appropriately to any given circumstance. The perfectly free human being is a person who, no matter what she or he encounters, can act appropriately.
  And what is lack of freedom? Anything which causes a blockage of this ability to react appropriately—whether it be internal obsessions or mental rigidity, or a political system, or the bars of a cage-causes a loss of freedom. Lack of freedom is loss, from whatever source, internal or external, of the ability to act appropriately. (Page 374)
- Broadly speaking, the reaction to each unsolved problem, or annoyance, or conflict that is encountered creates in the individual some level of stress. Stress is initially functional and productive. Its purpose is to mobilize the body in such a way that problems get solved. Adrenaline and other agents are mobilized throughout the system, creating special alertness and energy. All these help to address conflicts, unwind them, and to remove sources of annoyance. Each conflict or difficulty that the organism encounters, so long as it remains unsolved, adds to the stress that is mobilized. But there is a limited capacity for stress in every human individual. Varying from person to person, it is nevertheless quite finite in all of us.
  There is, in effect, a stress reservoir in the body. The amount of stress being coped with fills this reservoir, to different levels at different times. But as the stress reaches the top of the reservoir, the organism's ability to deal effectively with the stress decreases. This then gives rise to the "stress," as used in its popular meaning. The organism is overloaded. There are more problems occurring than can be solved. The total stress mobilized is beyond what the organism can cope with effectively. Slowly the situation deteriorates. When the stress is too great, creative functioning is impaired. Sometimes it finally breaks down altogether.
  Perhaps the most important finding of modern research on stress is that this stress is cumulative, because it is all in one currency. Stress from money worries, stress from physical pain, stress from an unresolved argument, stress from light shining in one's eyes - it is all stress, and it is all one kind of stress. So each of these apparently disparate stress effects fills the same stress reservoir. (Page 376)
- Almost any unresolved problem, even when small, adds to the reservoir of stress, and can reduce a person's ability to function well. So long as challenges faced are within the limits of the stress reservoir, a person is actively solving problems, and becomes more alive, more capable, more rewarded in the process of meeting the challenges. When the stress reservoir fills to impossible levels, the effect is opposite, and the accumulated stress prevents productivity, prevents loving relationships, prevents artistic and intellectual creativity, prevents people from being effective. (Page 377)
- Using Wertheimer's definition of freedom, we may define the best environment for human life. It would be one which gives people the maximum chance to be free, one which actually allows them to be free. A living environment is one which encourages, allows, each person to react appropriately to what happens, hence to be free, hence to encourage the most fruitful development in each person. This is an environment which goes as far as possible in allowing people's tendencies, their inner forces, to run loose, so that they can take care, by themselves, of their own development. It is an environment in which a person is free to grow, if she wishes to grow, and to do so where, and how, she chooses. (Page 380)
- In both cases, so long as the configuration is wrong, the conflict remains underground. Yet there is no benefit to keeping the conflict under the surface. All that does is add to stress. It does not contribute challenge. It is, in any case, invisible, experienced only in the built-up stress, not as a creative challenge. (Page 382)
- So why does this picture convey such substance? Because the washing of the clothes is part of the attic, part of the roof, part of the structure of the house. The wholeness of life is experienced. And this occurs because that washboard, the sink, fit awkwardly into an otherwise unused corner. There is no waste, nor money available for waste. Hard, dour as it is, it is complete. (Page 385)
- Simply put, many of the energy-draining conflicts or stress cycles that could happen have been removed. What exists in these places is something in balance, cleaned from extraneous stress, rather as a meadow of grass is free from stress cycles. (Page 385)
- The physical world, its wholeness, enters into these events very specifically in the following way: each of these situations is marked by a structure which leaves itself alone. What happens there can happen because what is there is only the essential of the world. There is no superfluous structure. It is easy. It feels relaxed, life-extreme, because there is no dross, no developer's trademarks, no attempt to sell the buyer, no room for extras which are not real. It is the purity of the Paris scene which allows these forms of life. (Page 385)
- This paring away of non-essential centers, the filtering out of extras, leaving only the essential centers there, can be created in a physical world which has only the essentials in it, and deliberately avoids all physical centers which are not absolutely required. (Page 385)
- This paring away of non-essential centers, the filtering out of extras, leaving only the essential centers there, can be created in a physical world which has only the essentials in it, and deliberately avoids all physical centers which are not absolutely required.
  This spirit is hard to attain. Perhaps it has always been hard, for all human beings, at all times in history. It is, perhaps, especially hard in our time. We have a world in which some live in poverty, not even having the bare essentials, while those who have more money generally have far beyond the bare essentials. A world made of essentials is unfamiliar to us. It does not exist in poverty; it does not exist in luxury. It does not exist in the vast acres of middle-class well-designed convenience. (Page 385)
- These are all centers. All of them, though in the realm of what we usually call "actions," can still be understood geometrically as part of the hierarchy of centers which are relatively more whole or more intense. But we now understand this wholeness to include centers which grow and fade as life goes on during the dynamic minute-to-minute actions and events which are occurring there. This new wholeness (which includes centers that are events) may still be sustained or not by other centers within the system. (Page 391)
- The wholeness may also be sustained by centers that are pure actions. (Page 391)
- Thus the wholeness is a complex living structure: it may be sustained, or not, by countless aspects of the various systems which surround and fill the space where the wholeness occurs. (Page 392)
- If we ask how this environment in Paris works to help people be free in themselves, the answer lies in the living structure. Again and again, a living world contains living centers, and we see them, feel them, experience them, are surrounded by them, bathed in them. Strong centers, boundaries, roughness, alternating repetition - all create living centers, and they do it in a way that makes things work. But, in addition, there is a factor which is large and overwhelming. It has to do with the strong nurturing sensation that occurs in that environment. Said simply, we feel overwhelmingly, deeply, comfortable in the structure of that Paris which Kertész photographed. (Page 392)
- In effect, then, these people in the photographs - no matter what miseries, what struggles, what human problems they experienceare nevertheless bathed in Self, they are surrounded by it, surrounded and sustained by a world in which every particle, each stone, each sidewalk, every door and window, reminds them of their own self, affirms the existence of their own self. And that is, of course, precisely the same living structure which will fare best on the mirror-of-the-self test. It is just this sort of thing, beautiful and rough, which most reminds us of our true self, the self which is sorrowful and happy, trivial and deep. (Page 393)
- The connection hinges simply on the fact that as one center is lifted, made more alive, by the sustaining quality of other living centers, so we, too, being living centers, are sustained, uplifted, made more alive, by the presence of other living centers.
  It, in the end, is as simple — and as profound — as that. (Page 393)
- That is, perhaps, where my conviction about the subject, and my effort to write these books, consolidated itself. People's experiences in the places I have built gradually made me understand that it is possible for us to build a world in which people are emotionally free, fully themselves, alive, extant in their own reality. (Page 396)
- No building (and no part of any building) has real life unless it is deeply and robustly functional.' What I mean by this, is that the beauty and force of any building arises always, and in its entirety, from the deep functional nature of the centers that have been created. (Page 404)
- I shall try to show that the functional behavior of buildings, the human life present in them, like its geometry, can all also be understood in terms of wholeness. That means that emotion, movement, light, comfort, climate, balance of functions, the ability of a room to accommodate the behavior in the room, the engineering structure, the manufacturing - all these practical matters can be understood in terms of centers. I shall argue that the full harmony of a functioning building, in the deepest functional sense, is itself something which can best be understood as a product of the wholeness and the field of centers. (Page 404)
- Function, like wholeness itself, is all based on centers. Function is simply the dynamic aspect of wholeness. A structure, viewed in a static sense, has to do with the system of centers that appear in it. As something lives, acts in the world, interacts with the world, different centers appear and disappear. Some are moving, some are temporary. The flux of these moving, transitory centers, and their appearing and disappearing, is the process we call life. (Page 405)
- The process we call "function" is the process by which the static system is --or is not-in harmony with this moving system of centers that we call life. Water flowing in a stream, nutrients growing in a biosphere, forces in a girder, cars moving on a street, rain falling, people sitting and talking- these are all centers rising and falling in the world. Thus, as cars cross a bridge, they form centers. Each car in itself is a center; the stream of cars forms centers; a traffic blockage is a center. The road system, which has its own geometric centers, is then either harmonious, or not harmonious, with the system of cars that are parked, moving, standing, and so on.
  When they are harmonious and coadapted, we call the system functional. (Page 405)
- There is nothing except the living structure of the world, and this living structure is all we need to reason with. We can fully describe all function, through living structure, and the living structure exists recursively, within the idea of living centers. (Page 405)
- What is most important here: all the functions of the room-things which things which appear at first sight as functional problems are in reality problems of centers. To provide for life, and to solve the possible problems you have to get the centers right. In short, to make the room work, you must make a dense, living structure. The practical matter is a matter of placing and arranging all these centers so that they work harmoni ously together. The hard part, the key part, lies in the way these centers are shaped, and strengthened, and arranged. (Page 415)
- In the holistic picture which I have been describing here, we see that each center- as a bit of geometry in the space affects and changes the other centers in its life. The wholeness is a physical system in which different centers modify each other through the geometric field effect. In this picture, centers may affect each other both geometrically and functionally, since all the effects among centers take place within the same domain. Ornament is just as important as function. Indeed, we cannot separate the two from one another. What we call ornament and what we call function are simply two versions of one more general phenomenon. (Page 415)
- So, what we have is that the analysis of all function should be done in terms of our effort to make every center precious. That means the basic rule of function is simply this: we try to make every part of the world precious, as far as we can. It sounds childish. But it is not. (Page 425)
- We will understand reality itself better if we can educate ourselves to abandon the mechanistic picture, which doesn't work, and concentrate on the picture of the living centers which, no matter how strange to our presentday mentality-actually does work. (Page 426)
- In this sense, what is going on is that life — an emergent thing in the space itself — appears as the space wakes up. When something works, or is "functional," its space is awakened to a very high degree. It becomes alive. The space itself becomes alive. (Page 427)
    - Note: I don't think I believe it as literally as Alexander does but it captures the key idea well
- Within this understanding, the distinction between function and ornament is spurious. Every emerging or unfolding field of centers is a part of the universe which becomes vigorously alive - privately, I like to think of this as a more blissful state of matter. As the whole emerges, the universe becomes ornamented by it. The rules of the emerging thing are exactly those which we have noticed for so-called "pure" ornament. (Page 428)
- The life of the whole may be described as a web of interconnecting dependencies, among the various species which thrive in one another's company. (Page 430)
- 1. Each center gets its life, always, from the fact that it is helping to support and enliven some larger center.
  2. The center becomes precious because of it. (Page 431)
- All this has come about because, in the intellectual atmosphere of pluralism, celebrated in the 20th century, it has been easy to say what one believes, but nearly impossible to say what is good or true. Indeed, avoiding, at all costs, serious discussion of what is good has been the reason for the crumbling failure of the past century's architecture. (Page 442)

Indeed, avoiding, at all costs, serious discussion of what is good has been the reason for the crumbling failure of the past century's architecture.
  But it is exactly that question which cannot be avoided. A criterion for judgment is the core - the necessary core of any architecture. A core of judgment cannot be created by shouting that one is right. Instead, a core of judgment must be found which appeals to the deepest instincts in everyone, so that we can say to ourselves, Yes, this is indeed the basis from which we ought to proceed, and therefore the basis from which we must proceed. (Page 442)
- My argument is simply this: the existence of wholeness is something real in the world, whether we choose to see it or pay attention to it, or not. It is a mathematical structure which exists in space. I believe that a holistic view of spacewhich shows how structure appears in space as a whole, as a result of local symmetries and centers follows from careful observation of what exists. (Page 442)
- The future of architecture can be changed, fundamentally, by an appreciation of living structure. If we choose, consciously and intentionally, to create this kind of living structure in the streets and buildings of our world, we have a good chance of being able to create a true living world, something of the same depth that traditional builders and craftsmen were able to accomplish. (Page 443)
- As I have suggested in chapter 10, there is reason to think that the existence of this living structure-wrapped in culture, based on culture, and mixed with culture, to be sure - is the substrate which provides us with our freedom, with the ability to be free in ourselves. Thus living structure has vital practical and social consequences. We may say that, for the sake of our own welfare, the world must be made so that it contains, and is built from, living structure. (Page 443)
- Substance is to be formed from the material of space in such a way that in it, we recognize our own souls. (Page 444)
- Although it may be impossible to construct a complete rank order on all the different possible subregions, it is clear that our intuition does typically assign some relative degree of coherence to each different subregion. We do recognize coherence in the world. This coherence, is just that attribute which I have referred to throughout Book I as life. (Page 446)
- I call the most coherent subregions of R, centers. A region will be considered more or less centered according to its life. The most coherent subregions S;, which have a c; close to 1, will be called the centers of R. Even among the centers, there are still degrees of relative life-some are more coherent than othersbut all of them establish, through their life, a phenomenon of centeredness in space. (Page 447)
- A similar suggestion was made by David Bohm. Thus: "Of course the prevailing tendency in science to think and perceive in terms of a fragmentary self-world view is part of a larger movement that has been developing over the ages and that pervades almost the whole of our society today.... As has been indicated, however, men who are guided by such a fragmentary selfworld view cannot do other, in the long run, than to try in their actions to break themselves and the world into pieces...."17 (Page 453)
- I was astonished, many years ago, to find out, in the course of an experiment I was doing with Radcliffe students, that most of them did not see the wholeness of simple patterns. They saw, instead, a distorted picture of these patterns, viewed them with arbitrary intellectual devices rather than responding to the deeper wholeness that was present in them. I found out, too, that it took immense effort to dissuade them from their distorted cognition, and to help them to see wholeness as it is. (Page 453)
    - Note: This feels symbolic of politics
- If we have notions, or theories, or preconceptions about the parts, we focus our minds on individual things, and fail to see the system of centers in its balance as a distributed, distended unity. (Page 455)
- This experiment is very instructive. It tells us that the ability to see wholeness as it is requires an unfocused view in which we do not select what we pay attention to or force attention in a certain mental direction. Instead we see, watch, drink in the configuration of the wholeness which we see before us. (Page 456)

Your highlights from *The Nature of Order: Book One: The Phenomenon of Life* reveal key themes and ideas that Christopher Alexander develops throughout the book. These passages emphasize his effort to redefine how we understand order, life, and wholeness in architecture and beyond. Here are some of the major takeaways from your highlights, organized for clarity and reference:

---

### **Foundational Ideas and Philosophical Shifts**
- **Order and Cosmology:** Alexander challenges traditional, mechanistic views of order and proposes a holistic, life-centered approach. He suggests that understanding order can reshape not only architecture but also our cosmological views (Pages 2, 8, 22).
- **Mechanistic Worldview Critique:** He critiques the mechanist-rationalist worldview, describing it as a pervasive "infection" that constrains our ability to create life-filled, harmonious spaces (Page 7).
- **Wholeness as Reality:** Central to his thesis is the concept of "wholeness," which he defines as a real, mathematical structure in space. Wholeness is the source of life in both animate and inanimate objects (Pages 80, 96, 444).

---

### **Centers and Wholeness**
- **Centers as Building Blocks:** Alexander introduces "centers" as fundamental units of wholeness. Centers are coherent zones in space that are defined by their relationship to other centers, creating a web of interconnections (Pages 84, 90, 106).
- **Life from Wholeness:** Life in architecture and space emerges from the interactions of centers. Centers support and intensify each other, creating structures that feel alive and harmonious (Pages 110, 116, 431).

---

### **Fifteen Properties of Living Structures**
- **Tools for Creating Life:** Alexander identifies 15 properties that foster life in design, including **levels of scale**, **strong centers**, **boundaries**, **alternating repetition**, and **not-separateness** (Page 239).
- **Properties as Interconnected:** These properties are not isolated; they work together to intensify centers and create living structures (Page 145).

---

### **Personal and Objective Truth**
- **Life and Feeling:** Alexander argues for an expanded concept of objective truth that includes value and feeling. This perspective links the life of a structure to human experience, asserting that wholeness affects our inner states (Pages 18, 22, 301).
- **Mirror of the Self:** A profound idea is the "mirror-of-the-self" test, which evaluates whether a structure resonates with our deepest sense of self and wholeness (Page 314).

---

### **Practical Implications**
- **Architecture and Freedom:** Living structures foster environments where people feel free, whole, and deeply connected to their surroundings (Pages 372, 380).
- **Stress and Functionality:** The wholeness of a space reduces stress and supports human creativity and well-being by eliminating unnecessary conflicts and fostering harmony (Pages 376, 415).

---

### **Challenges and Call to Action**
- **Recognizing Wholeness:** Alexander acknowledges that perceiving and creating wholeness requires a shift in cognition and effort to move beyond fragmentary views (Pages 455, 456).
- **Reviving Architecture:** He calls for a fundamental shift in architectural practice to prioritize living structures and wholeness as essential goals (Page 442).

Your highlights vividly illustrate Alexander's ambitious vision of architecture as a medium for life and wholeness, blending deep philosophy with practical tools. This foundation will allow your review to connect his ideas to broader themes of design, human experience, and the challenges of contemporary architecture.

Given all of that background context, take these impressions of mine (below) and draft a review / summary in my style

Positive
- I loved the core idea of cohesion, strong centers and the things that strengthen them, as non-mechanical, non-functional yet critical property of objects in space
- Wholeness is hard to pin down but very resonant
- The 15 properties of strong centers are both compelling and immediately useful
- Lots of great pictures to illustrate the idea
- Lots of good discussion of the properties and of centers

Negative
- A bit of "No true Scotsman" to a lot of the arguments
- The formalization seems a bit strained at time
- The attempt to make things too scientific yet based on feelings weakened the book rather than strengthened it, in my opinion
- There were a lot of specific examples where I disagreed and others where it felt like the pairing had been intentionally chosen to fit Alexander's thesis. I would have liked to see more examples where he found good examples in areas generally not aligned with his taste and bad examples in things generally aligned with his taste.

_The Phenomenon of Life_ sets out to redefine how we think about architecture, design, and even the nature of reality itself. It partially succeeds. Alexander argues that structures can possess a quality of life. This life emerges from the structures' coherence and wholeness. This is formalized as "centers" and the relationships between them. The book is primarily a philosophical treatise, although it does contain some practical tools for design. 

Alexander's goal is to move away from functional, mechanical views of what makes for a good or bad structure. He frames life and beauty in terms of spatial coherence: centers are not just isolated points of interest. They are dynamic zones of interaction strengthened by their relationship to other centers. He defines 15 fundamental properties of strong centers (levels of scale; strong centers; boundaries, alternating repetition; positive space; good shape; local symmetries; deep interlock and ambiguity; contrast; gradients; roughness; echoes; the void; simplicity and inner calm; not-separateness). For those familiar with _A Pattern Language_ these properties abstract some of the common properties instantiated in those particular patterns. This makes them harder to immediately apply but more flexible. The discussion of these properties, combined with vivid examples and abundant illustrations, anchor the book’s more abstract ideas in tangible reality. 

Where Alexander starts to lose me some is in the way he tries to make a case that these properties can be intuitively-yet-objectively sensed by human feelings. It's not that I disagree with the idea that the spaces and structures which have these properties are more intuitively appealing. The many examples show that they are. However, if often feels like Alexander’s arguments veer into “No true Scotsman” territory, where those who disagree with his judgment of which of two options are better are said to be out of touch with their true underlying feelings. 

And where the conclusion does feel unambiguous, one wonders how much the examples were curated to support the thesis. The book would have been stronger had Alexander included examples of "good" designs from areas outside his aesthetic preferences and “bad” examples from traditions he generally admires. This would have made his arguments more robust and less prone to the suspicion of confirmation bias.

The book’s attempt to formalize these concepts scientifically—while remaining rooted in subjective feeling—also feels doomed to failure even outside of individual disagreement. While Alexander’s goal ground his ideas as objective has a certain merit, this reliance on emotional resonance and formal objectivity feels strained. In particular, his “mirror-of-the-self” approach, often feel more anecdotal than conclusive.

Still, _The Phenomenon of Life_ is a profound and challenging work that succeeds in pushing the boundaries of how we think about space. Its core ideas about wholeness, centers, and the properties that bring them to life are deeply impactful and an interesting extension, especially for those who are looking for more after reading more well known works such as _A Pattern Language_ and _The Timeless Way of Building_. Even where it stumbles, the book sparks thought. For those willing to engage with its ideas critically, this book offers invaluable insights for thinking about structure, life, beauty, and connection.

The book’s attempt to formalize these concepts scientifically—while remaining rooted in subjective feeling—also feels precarious. While Alexander’s goal of grounding his ideas in objectivity has merit, his reliance on emotional resonance as evidence often feels strained. The “mirror-of-the-self” approach, in particular, leans heavily on anecdotal rather than conclusive reasoning.

Still, _The Phenomenon of Life_ is a profound and challenging work that pushes the boundaries of how we think about space. Its core ideas about wholeness, centers, and the properties that bring them to life are deeply impactful and serve as an interesting extension for those already familiar with Alexander’s better-known works, such as _A Pattern Language_ and _The Timeless Way of Building_. Even where it stumbles, the book sparks thought. For those willing to engage critically, it offers invaluable insights into structure, life, beauty, and connection.
