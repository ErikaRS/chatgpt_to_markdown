Why are company boards called boards? Is it because they sit around the table, a la room and board?

The term "board" in the context of a company board of directors does not come from the idea of sitting around a table like "room and board." Instead, it has historical origins related to the governance and oversight of organizations.

The term "board of directors" dates back to the 17th century in England. It was originally used in the context of chartered companies, such as the British East India Company, which were granted royal charters to conduct trade and other activities. These companies had a group of individuals appointed to oversee their affairs and make key decisions. These individuals were referred to as the "board of directors" because they were tasked with directing the company's operations and policies.

The term "board" itself likely comes from the idea of a flat, rigid surface, such as a wooden board, where important decisions and discussions could take place. Over time, this concept of a "board" evolved, and the term became standard nomenclature for the governing body of a corporation.

So, the term "board" in the context of company boards of directors has historical roots related to governance and decision-making, rather than the physical act of sitting around a table. However, it is common for board meetings to be conducted around a table, which is where the term "boardroom" comes from.

So... it is because of the table?

I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. While the term "boardroom" is indeed associated with the physical location where board meetings often take place around a table, the term "board of directors" itself does not primarily originate from the table. Instead, it derives from the historical context of governance and oversight of organizations, as I explained earlier.

The use of the term "board" likely evolved over time to encompass both the governing body and the physical location of meetings. So, while the table in the boardroom is where directors convene for discussions and decision-making, the term "board of directors" has deeper historical origins related to governance and management of companies, organizations, and institutions.

Right, but that's exactly the question, why is the word board, itself, associated with governance and oversight? 

### Assistant - 2023-11-29 15:24:24

The association of the word "board" with governance and oversight likely comes from the historical use of the term in the context of organized groups and decision-making bodies. While the exact origins of the word's association with governance may not be definitively documented, the concept likely developed over time as societies and organizations formed and needed a way to describe the groups responsible for making decisions and providing oversight.

Here are a few possibilities for why the term "board" came to be associated with governance and oversight:

1. Flat Surface for Decision-Making: The term "board" may have been chosen because a flat, rigid surface, such as a wooden board or table, provided a convenient place for individuals to gather and make important decisions. The idea of a "board" could signify a flat surface where discussions and decisions were made.

2. Historical Context: The use of "board" in the context of governing bodies may have been influenced by historical practices in which people would gather around a board or table to discuss important matters and make decisions. Over time, this practice could have led to the term being associated with governing bodies.

3. Linguistic Evolution: Language evolves over time, and words often acquire new meanings and associations based on their usage. The term "board" could have evolved to encompass the idea of a group responsible for governing and overseeing an organization or institution.

It's important to note that the specific historical origins of the term "board" in this context may not be well-documented, and language often evolves organically. As a result, the precise reason for the association between "board" and governance may not have a definitive explanation but likely developed over centuries of linguistic and cultural evolution.

ahh, so the real answer is that you don't know :-D 

### Assistant - 2023-11-29 15:24:50

Indeed, while I can provide plausible explanations for the association of the term "board" with governance and oversight, the exact historical origins of this association may not be definitively documented. Language and terminology often evolve over time, and the specific reasons for why certain words or phrases come to be associated with particular concepts can sometimes be challenging to pinpoint with absolute certainty.
