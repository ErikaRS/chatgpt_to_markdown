To access an environment variable inside of a string within another string on the command line, you can use nested quoting with the variable expansion syntax. Here are a few approaches to achieve that:

### 1. Using Double Quotes and Escape Characters
If the environment variable is already defined, you can use a combination of double quotes for the variable and escape characters to ensure it expands correctly:

```bash
export MY_VAR="Hello"
echo "This is the value: \"${MY_VAR}\" inside another string"
```

**Explanation:**
- `${MY_VAR}` will expand to the value of `MY_VAR`.
- The backslashes (`\`) escape the inner quotes, allowing them to be treated as literal parts of the string.

### 2. Using Single Quotes and Concatenation
Another option is to use single quotes with concatenation using double quotes to expand the variable:

```bash
export MY_VAR="Hello"
echo 'This is the value: '"\"${MY_VAR}\""' inside another string'
```

**Explanation:**
- Single quotes preserve everything literally.
- The concatenation with double quotes (`"${MY_VAR}"`) allows the variable to be expanded.
  
### 3. Use `$` in the Context Where Needed
If the variable expansion is used within a script or command:

```bash
export MY_VAR="Hello"
echo "This is the value: ${MY_VAR} inside another string"
```

**Explanation:**
- You can directly use `${MY_VAR}` inside a double-quoted string without needing additional escaping if no other quotes are involved.

Choose the approach that fits your specific needs in terms of nesting and quoting. The first approach is useful when your command is complex and involves more nesting levels.
