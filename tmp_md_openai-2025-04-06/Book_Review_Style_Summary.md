Your book review style is characterized by the following features:

1. **Objective and Informative:** You focus on providing a balanced, objective overview of the book's content, themes, and practical takeaways, without giving too much of your subjective opinion.

2. **Structured and Organized:** Your reviews follow a logical flow, starting with an overall impression, then diving into key ideas and themes, before concluding with the book's value.

3. **Clear and Concise:** You use clear, easy-to-understand language, summarizing complex ideas concisely and accessibly.

4. **In-Depth Analysis:** You offer detailed, specific insights into the book, avoiding superficial overviews.

5. **Balanced Perspective:** You note the book's strengths and limitations, giving readers a well-rounded perspective.

6. **Reflective:** Towards the end, you include a personal reflection, aligning the book's principles with your own views.

This results in reviews that are thorough, structured, and insightful, with a balance between objectivity and personal touch.

Here's a rough draft of a review. Keeping it's style and tone and wording as much as possible, copy edit and refine it to better conform to my style and be smooth to read.

Disclaimer: I am one of Sue's clients, so I've already seen a lot of these tools in action. 

As leaders, we spend our time in the content of our work: the needs of our team, the needs of our organizations, the decisions we need to make, etc. Yet for many of us, we are attracted to the idea of coaching: stepping away from the content of the present moment and helping people grow and find their own solutions to their problems. The role of leader coach is appealing to those of us love being engaged in the day-to-day of leadership but also want to pull on the power of coaching. Yet these two skillsets can require different mindsets: it's s shift from being the one in charge to empowering the coachee. Leaders can use the tools of conscious leadership that help them be better coaches. This book is far from the first on conscious leadership. What it brings to the table is a set of concrete and practical tools that aspiring leader coaches can apply to increase their skill and grow their coachees. 

The authors provide an excellent collection of practical tools and frameworks, neatly organized into chapters that can be consumed independently. Each chapter is packed with information, offering deep insights and actionable strategies. The book's style strikes a delicate balance between being a reference guide and a narrative, which makes it more suited for targeted, selective reading. Despite each chapter being fairly short, the density of the content can make it challenging to read for long stretches. I enjoyed reading a few chapters at a time and then taking a break to play around with the concepts in my head before coming back for more. However, the toolbox itself is extremely valuable and well put together, so it's a worthwhile read. 

This book is divided into 6 sections: 
- an overall guide to the book, including an introduction to conscious leadership
- a very short section on cultural prerequisites for leader coaching
- a section on "mental models" that help inform being a leader coach
- a section on the core tools of the leader coach: context, choices, and connection
- a section on 9 other useful tools, to be mixed and matched as makes sense
- a final section on how to work coaching into your role as a leader

To give a flavor for the tools in this book, I want to briefly give a high level overview of the core three: context versus content, the 8 choices, and presence and connection. 

Context versus content is one of the first tools Sue used with my team, and it's one that I find myself coming back to, both implicitly and explicitly. The content is the situation itself. The context is everything that influences the situation. When we or others are dealing with a challenging issue, we tend to get stuck in the content. For example, when making a challenging decision, we tend to focus on the decision itself. However, stepping back and looking at the context can help us understand why the decision is so hard. Are the people involved (including yourself) pulling from a past experience that may not be applicable? Are there impacts that would cause trouble? Bringing in the context may feel too squishy and emotional, but what it does in practice if open up the number of options available for making progress by allowing you to address some of the context issues head on. 

The 8 choices are derived from _The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership_. These 8 choices are mindsets that the leader coach can work from to be in an open, coaching mindset. Note that it is not that the closed version of each mindset is bad. However, it does make it harder to apply a coaching mindset to a specific situation. The 8 choices are: choosing to take 100% responsibility (neither more nor less), being curious and open (the opposite of your story could be true!), seeing feelings as a source of information, being candid with others and allowing others to be candid, making clean agreements that specify who will do what by when, living in your zone of genius where you have maximal creativity and flow (and encouraging others to do the same), taking time to play and rest, and choosing to experience life from a perspective of abundance. (Many of these are covered in more detail in the rest of the book.) Remember, the purpose of these agreements isn't to judge whether someone is in a "good" or "bad" state. It's to help assess how open you and others are to taking an open and curious perspective to the problem at hand. 

The third core tool is being fully present and authentically connected. We can encouraging by opening an engagement with an exercise that helps us be present in the conversation. These can be check in questions, meditations, or even just a shared breath. 

By starting from the core of context, choices and connection, the leader coach and others involved can enter the conversation with a mindset that is ready to dig deeper. 

I won't go into the other tools in detail. But here are my favorites. 100% responsibility is the idea that someone can take too much or too little responsibility for a situation. Unconscious commitments are the things we might not know we're committing to but which keep us from our goals. I had a lot of fun with the personas tool: zooming in on different aspects of your patterns of reaction by naming them as personas. My personas were based on literary characters, not surprisingly. Clean agreements make sure agreements come with clear details about who will do what by when. Once you see how many agreements are not clean, you realize it's amazing how anything ever gets done. 

Overall, if you're interested in becoming a more effective leader coach and looking for some practical tools that will help you do so, this book is an excellent resource to have on hand.

Here is a refined version of your review, edited for smoothness, clarity, and flow while maintaining your original tone and style:

**Disclaimer:** I am one of Sue's clients, so I have already experienced many of these tools in action.

As leaders, we often focus on the content of our work: the needs of our team, the demands of the organization, the decisions we need to make. Yet many of us are drawn to coaching, a practice that steps away from the immediate content and instead focuses on helping others grow and find their own solutions. The role of a leader-coach appeals to those of us who enjoy the day-to-day challenges of leadership but also want to leverage the power of coaching. However, these two roles often require different mindsets—it’s a shift from being the one in charge to empowering the coachee. Leaders can integrate the tools of conscious leadership to enhance their coaching skills. This book, while not the first on conscious leadership, offers a set of concrete, practical tools that aspiring leader-coaches can apply to increase their effectiveness and support their coachees' growth.

The authors provide an excellent collection of practical tools and frameworks, neatly organized into chapters that can be read independently. Each chapter is packed with insights and actionable strategies. The book strikes a balance between being a reference guide and a narrative, making it particularly well-suited for targeted, selective reading. While the chapters are relatively short, the density of information can make it difficult to read for extended periods. Personally, I found it helpful to read a few chapters at a time and then pause to reflect on and experiment with the concepts before continuing. Despite its depth, the toolbox presented is extremely valuable and well-curated, making the book a worthwhile resource.

The book is divided into six sections:
- An overall guide, including an introduction to conscious leadership.
- A brief section on the cultural prerequisites for leader-coaching.
- A section on "mental models" that inform the leader-coach approach.
- A section on the core tools of the leader-coach: context, choices, and connection.
- A section on nine additional tools, to be mixed and matched as needed.
- A final section on integrating coaching into your leadership role.

To give a sense of the tools in this book, I'll offer a high-level overview of the three core concepts: context vs. content, the 8 choices, and presence and connection.

Context vs. content is one of the first tools Sue introduced to my team, and it’s one I return to frequently, both implicitly and explicitly. The content is the immediate situation at hand, while the context encompasses everything that influences that situation. When facing a challenge, we often get stuck in the content. For example, when making a difficult decision, we might fixate on the decision itself. However, stepping back and considering the context can reveal why the decision is so challenging. Are the people involved (including yourself) drawing on past experiences that may not apply here? Are there hidden impacts that complicate the issue? Although addressing the context might seem too abstract or emotional, in practice, it opens up more options for progress by allowing us to confront underlying influences directly.

The 8 choices come from _The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership_. These choices represent mindsets that help the leader-coach maintain an open, coaching perspective. Importantly, the "closed" versions of these mindsets are not necessarily bad, but they can make it harder to adopt a coaching approach in specific situations. The 8 choices are: taking 100% responsibility (no more, no less), staying curious and open (remember, the opposite of your story could be true!), viewing feelings as information, being candid and allowing others to be candid, making clean agreements that specify who will do what by when, working in your "zone of genius" where you experience maximum creativity and flow (and encouraging others to do the same), taking time for play and rest, and approaching life from a perspective of abundance. (Many of these are explored further in the rest of the book.) The purpose of these choices isn’t to judge whether someone is in a "good" or "bad" state; it’s to assess how open you and others are to a curious and constructive perspective on the problem at hand.

The third core tool is fostering presence and authentic connection. Leaders can encourage this by starting conversations with exercises that bring everyone into the present moment—this might be a check-in question, a short meditation, or simply a shared breath.

By focusing on context, choices, and connection, the leader-coach and others can approach conversations with a mindset ready to explore deeper issues.

While I won’t go into the other tools in detail, I will highlight a few of my favorites. The concept of 100% responsibility encourages taking only as much responsibility as is appropriate for a situation. Unconscious commitments refer to the hidden obligations we may not realize we're making, which can hold us back from our goals. I also enjoyed the personas tool, which involves naming different aspects of your reactions as distinct personas—mine were based on literary characters, unsurprisingly! Clean agreements, which ensure clarity about who will do what by when, were another standout for me. Once you realize how many agreements are not clean, it's amazing that anything gets done at all.

Overall, if you're looking to become a more effective leader-coach and want practical tools to help you do so, this book is an excellent resource to have on hand.
