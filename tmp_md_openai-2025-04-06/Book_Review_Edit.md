Copy edit this in line with my book review style: In this book, Edith and Simon travels to Wild Wales and realizes that not all is as it seems as they meet fellow Dragon Keepers for the first time. Although I ended up enjoying this book, it was quite a change from the first two books. The first two books were low stakes and cozy. In this book, the stakes are raised and the book ends with some real unresolved tension. I enjoyed it, but it did take me a bit to reset my expectations. That said, I'm glad I did.

In this book, Edith and Simon journey to Wild Wales, where they discover that not everything is as it seems. For the first time, they encounter fellow Dragon Keepers, an experience that deepens the intrigue and complexity of their world. While I ultimately found this book enjoyable, it marked a noticeable departure from the tone of the first two installments. The earlier books were characterized by their low-stakes, cozy narratives, but this entry raises the stakes significantly, culminating in unresolved tension that leaves a lasting impression. Adjusting to this shift in tone took some time, but I’m glad I persisted—it was well worth it.

Clean this up a bit while keeping the tone chatty: This is the conclusion of The Secrets of Ormdale series (although the end material indicates there's more to come in this world!). On its own, I would rate it a 3/5. The first part of the book has an interesting, although somewhat rushed storyline of Edith learning about her mother's family. I would have liked to see a full book focused just on that, including travel to Italy. But because this book was trying to finish up the series, we rushed through that so that we could spend the second part of the book resolving a bunch of storylines from throughout the series. I do appreciate how well the author brought everything together in the end, so as a conclusion to the series I give the book a 4.

This book marks the conclusion of *The Secrets of Ormdale* series—though the end material hints there’s more to explore in this world! On its own, I’d give it a 3/5. The first part of the story, which focuses on Edith learning about her mother’s family, is intriguing but feels a bit rushed. I couldn’t help wishing for a whole book dedicated to that storyline, complete with a journey to Italy. However, because this book needed to wrap up the series, we sped through that arc to focus on resolving various threads from earlier installments. That said, I really appreciate how skillfully the author tied everything together in the end. As a series finale, I’d bump it up to a 4.
