Lens stacking: 

Here’s what kept me awake tonight. 

It started with the thread can-you-even-cynefin. 



I had never really spent much time considering cynefin before that thread.  “The dark disorder domain in the center represents situations where there is no clarity about which of the other domains apply.”     I started asking myself “how big is that category?” and is there any texture within that category or is it just darkness in there?   

Is there a classification system that can be applied on top of the cynefin classification, that categorizes the ways in which one can be wrong?   I can mistake something as obvious when it is in fact chaotic and so on.  In Flux we often talk about this kind of mistake, but I don’t think we have a method for laying out all the ways one can be wrong. Like this: 





REALITY




BELIEF


Complex
Complicated
Chaotic
Obvious
Complex

A3
A4
Complicated
B1
B2
B3
B4
Chaotic
C1
C2
C3
C4
Obvious
D1
D2
D3
D4


(It would be fun to give the most common ways of being wrong more memorable names than letter/number.  I’m not sure about the fails, but A1 could be “OBRA” for “Oh Boy, Right Again” 1)  

Intellectually I know the pandemic is complex. Nonetheless I keep making predictions as if it’s merely complicated. “Vaccines are going to fix everything!” has been my B1 failure.  And I keep going through the duh, B1-to-A1-again head smack. 

This classification system can then drop into a failure modes and effects analysis. Maybe we call this a Dunning-Kruger-FMEA.   

DK-FMEA
Failure mode
Likelihood
Severity if wrong, benefit if right
Detectability
Mitigation or augmentation
Etc. 
A1
etc
Benefit x






A2


Severity y






A3










A4










B1










...etc.













This is where I decided to get out of bed: It’s possible to generalize this method to many other classification schemes:  For instance, it can be applied to the classifications in any problem solving method (PSM). 

Or to any other situational classification.  Just totally picking one out of a hat: Sun Tsu recommends “It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two”2

I think my army is 10 times as big, but what if it’s only 2 times as big? (A3 failure)

Lens Stacking
So this is a kind of lens stacking.  I can stack this lens on top of many other lenses. Are there other ways of stacking lenses?  

Turns out stacks of lenses are called, disappointingly, a "lens"

Last Point

I think this idea is original. A1 or A2?

Lenses fall into different categories - some lenses flip foreground for background; some lenses classify the world in new ways - “part the word at it’s joints”.  


Take any assumption and its opposite. Say you want to go to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  Belief 1) There is a tiger in the kitchen, Belief 2) there is no tiger in the kitchen.  Put it into a two by two: 





Belief




1) Tiger 
2) No Tiger

Truth
A) Tiger
A1
A2
B) No Tiger
B1
B2


How tightly should I hold a belief, and how much should you consider alternative beliefs? In A2 i believe there’s no tiger in the kitchen but there is and it eats me.  In B1 I believe there’s a tiger and there isn’t, so I miss out on getting that sandwich for no reason. If I factor in likelihood in this case, I’ll go for B2. But this is an easy case.  

Putting different beliefs in a matrix like this shows you different kinds and severities of failures.  @ben mathes pointed out that discovering some A2 or B1 failures can shake your whole ontological frame, e.g.,  “My friends can be trusted”

This could be applied to any current event (Putin is smart, Putin is dumb) to illuminate that current event and share this as a thinking tool.

Extract the key ideas in all of these notes

### Assistant - 2024-08-28 16:18:06

Here are the key ideas extracted from the notes:

1. **Lens Stacking and Classification**:
   - The idea of stacking lenses (combining different perspectives) to analyze situations.
   - Classification of mistakes based on the Cynefin framework (Complex, Complicated, Chaotic, Obvious) and the possibility of misclassifying situations.
   - The concept of a "Dunning-Kruger-FMEA" to assess the likelihood and impact of errors in judgment based on misclassification.
   - Generalizing this method to other classification systems, like Sun Tzu's military strategies.

2. **Lenses with Opposites and Risks**:
   - Using a 2x2 matrix to explore different beliefs and their opposites (e.g., belief in the presence or absence of a tiger in the kitchen).
   - Examining the consequences of being wrong (e.g., A2 or B1 failures) and how these failures can have varying levels of impact on one's beliefs or actions.

3. **Categories of Lenses**:
   - Lenses that either shift the foreground/background of perception or classify the world in novel ways.
   - The importance of considering the severity of being wrong when using these lenses.

4. **Negativity Bias and Decision-Making**:
   - The impact of negativity bias on risk assessment and decision-making, emphasizing the importance of avoiding fatal errors.
   - The contrasting approach of venture capitalists who spread risk and may downplay the chance of being wrong.
   - The role of survivorship bias in shaping perceptions of risk and success.

5. **Creativity and Risk**:
   - Creativity as an attractive option in high-stakes situations.
   - The "cone of uncertainty" and how further-out possibilities become less certain.
   - The gap between perceived realistic possibilities and what is actually realistic in goal setting.

Synthesize these connections into an outline of a single piece that focuses on the idea of "lenses with opposites and risks", "categories of lenses", "negativity bias and decisoin making", and "creativity and risk". Mainly ignore "lens stacking and classification"

### Assistant - 2024-08-28 16:22:32

### Outline: "Lenses of Perception: Balancing Opposites, Risk, and Creativity in Decision-Making"

#### Introduction
- **Thesis**: Our decision-making process is deeply influenced by the lenses we use to interpret the world, particularly when these lenses focus on opposites, risks, and creativity. By understanding the categories of these lenses and the biases that affect them, we can make better, more informed decisions.

#### I. **Lenses with Opposites and Risks**
- **A. Concept of Opposite Lenses**
  - Introduction to using a 2x2 matrix to explore belief systems and their opposites.
  - Example: "Tiger in the Kitchen" scenario—examining the risks associated with different beliefs (A2: Ignoring real danger vs. B1: Avoiding imagined danger).
  - **B. Risk of Being Wrong**
  - Discussion on how the severity of potential outcomes influences decision-making.
  - Exploration of how being wrong can have varying levels of impact depending on the scenario (e.g., existential threats vs. missed opportunities).

#### II. **Categories of Lenses**
- **A. Foreground/Background Shifting Lenses**
  - Explanation of lenses that alter our focus, switching between the obvious and the overlooked.
  - Examples of how this can change perception and decision-making.
- **B. World-Partitioning Lenses**
  - Lenses that classify the world into new categories, allowing us to "part the world at its joints."
  - Discussion on the importance of these lenses in identifying previously unseen connections and risks.
- **C. Importance of Misclassification**
  - How misclassifying situations within these lenses can lead to significant errors in judgment.
  - The need to be aware of potential misclassification to better manage risks.

#### III. **Negativity Bias and Decision-Making**
- **A. The Role of Negativity Bias**
  - Definition and explanation of negativity bias and its impact on risk assessment.
  - **B. Avoiding Fatal Errors**
  - Discussion on the evolutionary importance of avoiding fatal errors (e.g., situations that take one out of the "gene pool").
  - How this bias leads us to overemphasize negative outcomes and avoid risks.
- **C. Outsourcing Risk and Survivorship Bias**
  - Venture capitalists’ approach to spreading risk and how they manage the implications of being wrong.
  - Discussion on survivorship bias and how it distorts our perception of risk and success.

#### IV. **Creativity and Risk**
- **A. Creativity in High-Stakes Situations**
  - Exploration of how creativity becomes more attractive when faced with high stakes or life-threatening scenarios.
  - **B. The Cone of Uncertainty**
  - Introduction to the "cone of uncertainty" concept—how uncertainty increases with time and distance from the present.
  - Connecting this with the realistic vs. perceived possibilities in decision-making.
- **C. Balancing Creativity with Realism**
  - How to find a balance between creative thinking and realistic expectations, especially when assessing risks.
  - Example scenarios where creative approaches succeeded or failed due to poor risk assessment.

#### Conclusion
- **Summary**: Reiterate the importance of understanding the different lenses we use in decision-making, particularly those that involve opposites, risks, and creativity. Emphasize the need to recognize and mitigate biases like negativity bias and survivorship bias to make better decisions.
- **Final Thought**: Encourage readers to consciously choose and combine their lenses, being mindful of the risks and opportunities they reveal.

### User - 2024-08-28 16:24:06

Ugh, this is kind of boring. I want something more punchy. Modify the outline to support a thesis of "For any decision we make, we may be right or we may be wrong. However, some ways in which we can be wrong can shake your whole ontological frame"

### Assistant - 2024-08-28 16:24:20

### Outline: "The High Stakes of Being Wrong: When Decisions Shake Your Ontological Frame"

#### Introduction
- **Thesis**: Every decision carries the risk of being wrong, but some mistakes are more than just errors—they can shatter your entire worldview. Understanding the lenses we use to navigate these decisions is crucial to managing the risks that can redefine our reality.

#### I. **The Knife Edge of Opposites**
- **A. Exploring Opposites Through Lenses**
  - Introduce the concept of viewing decisions through opposing beliefs (e.g., "Tiger in the Kitchen").
  - **B. The Stakes of Being Wrong**
  - Discuss the potential consequences when reality clashes with belief—how being wrong in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., A2: Ignoring a real threat) can upend your understanding of safety and risk.
  - **C. Ontological Disruption**
  - Highlight how certain mistakes (e.g., believing there's no danger when there is) don't just cause failure—they force a fundamental reassessment of what is true or possible.

#### II. **Categories of Lenses: How We See Shapes What We Fear**
- **A. Shifting Foregrounds and Backgrounds**
  - Explain how lenses that shift focus can lead to catastrophic misjudgments—missing the tiger in favor of the sandwich.
  - **B. Partitioning the World**
  - Explore how lenses that categorize the world in novel ways (e.g., dividing risks into manageable vs. existential) can expose unseen dangers or false securities.
  - **C. Misclassification’s Ontological Impact**
  - Discuss how misclassifying a situation within these lenses can lead to a complete breakdown of your mental model, forcing a reevaluation of everything you believed.

#### III. **Negativity Bias: The Survival Instinct that Warps Reality**
- **A. The Dark Side of Negativity Bias**
  - Explain how negativity bias amplifies our fear of being wrong, leading to overly cautious decisions that can also be wrong in ways that shatter confidence (e.g., B1: Avoiding imaginary dangers).
  - **B. Fatal Errors vs. Everyday Mistakes**
  - Contrast everyday errors with those that carry the weight of survival, showing how the fear of fatal errors can skew decision-making toward extreme caution, sometimes at the cost of opportunity.
  - **C. When Survivorship Bias Meets Negativity Bias**
  - Discuss how these biases combine to create a distorted view of risk, where the fear of being wrong overshadows the reality of being right, potentially leading to decisions that are safe but stifling.

#### IV. **Creativity in the Face of Existential Risk**
- **A. Creativity as a Last Resort**
  - Explore how creativity emerges as a response to high-stakes scenarios where being wrong is not an option, and how this can either save or destroy you depending on the accuracy of your underlying assumptions.
  - **B. The Cone of Uncertainty and the Mirage of Certainty**
  - Introduce the "cone of uncertainty" and how it challenges the perception of what’s possible—showing that sometimes the biggest risk is thinking you know more than you do.
  - **C. The Thin Line Between Genius and Catastrophe**
  - Examine how creative solutions can either brilliantly sidestep disaster or lead you into it, depending on whether the risks were correctly assessed.

#### Conclusion
- **Summary**: Reiterate that the real danger in decision-making isn’t just in being wrong—it’s in being wrong in a way that challenges everything you thought you knew. The lenses we use are both our guides and our potential undoing.
- **Final Thought**: Urge readers to embrace the complexity of decision-making, recognizing that the most significant risks aren’t just failures but paradigm shifts that force us to confront and reconstruct our understanding of reality.

### The High Stakes of Being Wrong: Turning Mistakes into Opportunities

Every decision we make carries the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than just cause setbacks—they can challenge our entire worldview, shaking the foundations of what we believe to be true. These moments, while unsettling, offer powerful opportunities for growth and deeper understanding. By carefully examining the lenses through which we view our decisions, we can navigate these risks with greater clarity and turn potential failures into transformative experiences.

One way to approach this is by considering opposing beliefs through the concept of "opposite lenses." For example, imagine a scenario where you believe there’s no danger ahead, but reality holds a hidden threat. If your belief is wrong, the consequences could be severe, forcing you to reconsider everything you thought you knew about safety and risk. However, this same situation can also illuminate new insights, helping you to develop a more nuanced understanding of the world and the decisions you face.

The lenses we use to interpret reality—whether they shift our focus between the foreground and background or categorize the world in novel ways—shape what we fear and how we act. Misclassifying a situation through these lenses can lead to significant errors, but it can also create space for a more accurate and resilient perspective. By recognizing when our mental models are flawed, we can correct course and build stronger, more adaptable frameworks for future decisions.

Ultimately, the true value in decision-making lies not just in avoiding mistakes but in recognizing the potential within those mistakes to rethink, rebuild, and grow. When we refine our lenses and embrace the possibility of being wrong, we open ourselves up to learning and innovation. This approach allows us to turn challenges into stepping stones, emerging stronger and more resilient from each experience.

So, as you face decisions—whether in your personal life or in broader contexts—remember that the risk of being wrong is also an invitation to deepen your understanding. Approach each choice with a balance of caution and creativity, knowing that even when things don’t go as planned, there’s often an opportunity to evolve and discover new paths forward.

Here's a revised version based on the above. Make it 3/4 of length. Make it more concrete and punchy while still keeping an overall FLUX-y tone

Every decision we make carries the potential of being right and the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than just cause setbacks—they can challenge our entire worldview, shaking the foundations of what we believe to be true. These moments, while unsettling, offer powerful opportunities for growth and deeper understanding. 

One way to approach this is by comparing our beliefs to our reality. For example, imagine a scenario where you believe there’s no danger ahead — going on a date with your partner — but reality holds a hidden threat — they plan to break up with you. If your belief that your relationship is sound is wrong, the consequences could be severe, forcing you to reconsider everything you thought you knew about your relationship, the other person, and even yourself. 

The fact that some mistakes carry higher costs than others is a direct cause of negativity bias, which often drives us to overemphasize potential dangers. Taken too far, this can lead to risk aversion and inaction. Instead of letting the fact that some mistakes have severe consequences incapacitate us, we can use this insight to develop a more nuanced understanding of the world and the decisions you face.

The lenses we use to interpret reality shape what we fear and how we act. Misclassifying a situation through these lenses can lead to significant errors, but it can also create space for a more accurate and resilient perspective. While negativity bias might push us to avoid risks, it’s important to remember that creativity often emerges in response to high-stakes scenarios. When faced with challenges, we can harness this creativity to turn potential pitfalls into opportunities for innovation and positive change.

Here’s a shorter, more concrete version:

---

Every decision we make carries the potential of being right and the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than set us back—they can shake our entire worldview, forcing us to rethink what we believe to be true. These moments, while jarring, offer powerful opportunities for growth.

Consider this: you believe your relationship is solid, so you plan a date with your partner. But the reality is different—they intend to break up with you. If you’re wrong about the state of your relationship, the impact is profound, challenging your understanding of yourself and your connection with others.

This is where negativity bias kicks in. Because some mistakes have severe consequences, we tend to overemphasize potential dangers, which can lead to paralysis and inaction. But rather than letting this bias hold us back, we can use it to sharpen our understanding and make more thoughtful decisions.

The lenses we use to interpret reality shape our fears and actions. Misjudgments can lead to errors, but they also open the door to new perspectives. While negativity bias might make us overly cautious, it’s crucial to remember that creativity often thrives in high-stakes situations. When challenges arise, creativity can turn risks into opportunities for innovation and growth.

Ultimately, the key to decision-making isn’t just avoiding mistakes but embracing them as opportunities to rethink, rebuild, and learn. By refining our lenses and accepting the possibility of being wrong, we invite growth and innovation. This mindset turns challenges into stepping stones, helping us become more resilient and insightful with each experience.

So, as you make decisions—whether personal or professional—remember that the risk of being wrong is also an opportunity to deepen your understanding. Balance caution with creativity, knowing that even when things don’t go as planned, there’s always a chance to learn and discover new paths forward.

Add a bit more to introduce the relationship of lenses to the first three paragraphs. Also, while I overall like the optimistic tone, at the moment it feels a bit pollyannaish, so tone it down just a little. Do this by acknowledging the value of negativity bias from a survival perspective. 

### Assistant - 2024-08-28 16:42:26

Here’s a revised version:

Every decision we make carries the potential of being right and the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than set us back—they can shake our entire worldview, forcing us to rethink what we believe to be true. These moments, while jarring, offer opportunities for growth if we can recognize the lenses through which we see the world and adjust accordingly.

Take relationships as an example. You might believe your relationship is solid, so you plan a date with your partner. But the reality is different—they intend to break up with you. If you’re wrong about the state of your relationship, the impact is profound, challenging your understanding of yourself and your connection with others. The lens through which you viewed your relationship suddenly seems cracked.

This is where negativity bias, an instinct honed for survival, comes into play. Because some mistakes have severe consequences, we tend to focus on potential dangers, often at the expense of seeing opportunities. While this bias can protect us from harm, it can also lead to paralysis and missed chances. Recognizing this bias allows us to refine our perspective, balancing caution with the courage to move forward.

The lenses we use to interpret reality shape our fears and actions. Misjudgments can lead to significant errors, but they also create space for new perspectives and resilience. Although negativity bias might make us overly cautious, it’s essential to remember that creativity often emerges in high-stakes situations. When challenges arise, creativity can turn risks into opportunities for innovation and growth, helping us navigate through uncertainty with greater confidence.

Ultimately, the key to decision-making isn’t just avoiding mistakes but embracing them as opportunities to rethink, rebuild, and learn. By refining our lenses and accepting the possibility of being wrong, we open ourselves to growth and innovation. This mindset turns challenges into stepping stones, making us more resilient and insightful with each experience.

So, as you make decisions—whether personal or professional—remember that the risk of being wrong is also an opportunity to deepen your understanding. Balance caution with creativity, knowing that even when things don’t go as planned, there’s always a chance to learn and discover new paths forward.

Now, putting that draft aside for a moment, summarize the tool described in these rough notes: 
Lenses fall into different categories - some lenses flip foreground for background; some lenses classify the world in new ways - “part the word at it’s joints”.  


Take any assumption and its opposite. Say you want to go to the kitchen to make a sandwich.  Belief 1) There is a tiger in the kitchen, Belief 2) there is no tiger in the kitchen.  Put it into a two by two:

How tightly should I hold a belief, and how much should you consider alternative beliefs? In A2 i believe there’s no tiger in the kitchen but there is and it eats me.  In B1 I believe there’s a tiger and there isn’t, so I miss out on getting that sandwich for no reason. If I factor in likelihood in this case, I’ll go for B2. But this is an easy case.  

Putting different beliefs in a matrix like this shows you different kinds and severities of failures.  @ben mathes pointed out that discovering some A2 or B1 failures can shake your whole ontological frame, e.g.,  “My friends can be trusted”

This could be applied to any current event (Putin is smart, Putin is dumb) to illuminate that current event and share this as a thinking tool.

The tool described in the notes is a decision-making matrix that helps assess the risks and implications of holding a particular belief versus its opposite. By placing a belief and its opposite in a 2x2 matrix against the truth of a situation, this tool allows you to evaluate different scenarios and the potential consequences of being right or wrong.

For example, consider the belief that there's a tiger in the kitchen. The matrix compares this belief (and its opposite) with the actual truth (tiger or no tiger) to explore four possible outcomes:
- **A1**: You believe there’s a tiger, and there is one (correct, avoid danger).
- **A2**: You believe there’s no tiger, but there is (incorrect, severe consequences).
- **B1**: You believe there’s a tiger, but there isn’t (incorrect, unnecessary caution).
- **B2**: You believe there’s no tiger, and there isn’t (correct, proceed safely).

This tool highlights how the severity of the outcome can vary based on the accuracy of your belief. For instance, some mistakes (like A2) can be catastrophic and shake your entire worldview, while others (like B1) may lead to missed opportunities but not existential threats. The matrix can be applied to various situations, helping to clarify the potential impact of being wrong and guiding more informed decision-making.

DRAFT: 
Every decision we make carries the potential of being right and the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than set us back—they can shake our entire worldview, forcing us to rethink what we believe to be true. These moments, while jarring, offer opportunities for growth if we can recognize the lenses through which we see the world and adjust accordingly.

Take relationships as an example. You might believe your relationship is solid, so you plan a date with your partner. But the reality is different—they intend to break up with you. If you’re wrong about the state of your relationship, the impact is profound, challenging your understanding of yourself and your connection with others. The lens through which you viewed your relationship suddenly seems cracked.

This is where negativity bias, an instinct honed for survival, comes into play. Because some mistakes have severe consequences, we tend to focus on potential dangers, often at the expense of seeing opportunities. While this bias can protect us from harm, it can also lead to paralysis and missed chances. Recognizing this bias allows us to refine our perspective, balancing caution with the courage to move forward.

The lenses we use to interpret reality shape our fears and actions. Misjudgments can lead to significant errors, but they also create space for new perspectives and resilience. Although negativity bias might make us overly cautious, it’s essential to remember that creativity often emerges in high-stakes situations. When challenges arise, creativity can turn risks into opportunities for innovation and growth, helping us navigate through uncertainty with greater confidence.

Ultimately, the key to decision-making isn’t just avoiding mistakes but embracing them as opportunities to rethink, rebuild, and learn. By refining our lenses and accepting the possibility of being wrong, we open ourselves to growth and innovation. This mindset turns challenges into stepping stones, making us more resilient and insightful with each experience.

So, as you make decisions—whether personal or professional—remember that the risk of being wrong is also an opportunity to deepen your understanding. Balance caution with creativity, knowing that even when things don’t go as planned, there’s always a chance to learn and discover new paths forward.

### The High Stakes of Being Wrong: Turning Mistakes into Opportunities

Every decision we make carries the potential of being right and the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than set us back—they can shake our entire worldview, forcing us to rethink what we believe to be true. These moments, while jarring, offer opportunities for growth if we can recognize the lenses through which we see the world and adjust accordingly.

One effective way to navigate these challenges is by using a decision-making matrix that helps assess the risks and implications of holding a particular belief versus its opposite. For example, imagine you believe there's no danger in the kitchen, so you head in to make a sandwich. But what if there's a tiger lurking inside? This matrix compares your belief (and its opposite) with the actual truth to explore four possible outcomes:

- **A1**: You believe there’s a tiger, and there is one (correct, avoid danger).
- **A2**: You believe there’s no tiger, but there is (incorrect, severe consequences).
- **B1**: You believe there’s a tiger, but there isn’t (incorrect, unnecessary caution).
- **B2**: You believe there’s no tiger, and there isn’t (correct, proceed safely).

This tool highlights how the severity of the outcome varies based on the accuracy of your belief. For instance, some mistakes (like A2) can be catastrophic, forcing you to rethink your entire approach to safety and risk. Others (like B1) may lead to unnecessary caution, but without existential threats. The matrix can be applied to various situations, helping to clarify the potential impact of being wrong and guiding more informed decision-making.

Consider this approach in the context of relationships. You might believe your relationship is solid, so you plan a date with your partner. But the reality is different—they intend to break up with you. If your belief that your relationship is sound is wrong, the impact is profound, challenging your understanding of yourself and your connection with others. The lens through which you viewed your relationship suddenly seems cracked, and you're forced to confront a new reality.

This is where negativity bias, an instinct honed for survival, comes into play. Because some mistakes have severe consequences, we tend to focus on potential dangers, often at the expense of seeing opportunities. While this bias can protect us from harm, it can also lead to paralysis and missed chances. Recognizing this bias allows us to refine our perspective, balancing caution with the courage to move forward.

Ultimately, the key to decision-making isn’t just avoiding mistakes but embracing them as opportunities to rethink, rebuild, and learn.

More directly integrate this insight: "How tightly should I hold a belief, and how much should you consider alternative beliefs? In A2 i believe there’s no tiger in the kitchen but there is and it eats me.  In B1 I believe there’s a tiger and there isn’t, so I miss out on getting that sandwich for no reason. If I factor in likelihood in this case"

Also, put the tool after the negativity bias paragraph.

The critical question is how tightly you should hold your belief and how much you should consider alternatives. In the A2 scenario, if you believe there’s no tiger but there is, the consequences are severe. In B1, believing there’s a tiger when there isn’t might make you miss out on a sandwich for no reason. Factoring in the likelihood of each outcome helps you determine whether to hold onto your belief or adjust it, balancing the risks and rewards.

Ultimately, the key to decision-making isn’t just avoiding mistakes but embracing them as opportunities to rethink, rebuild, and learn.

What is the FLUX tone? 

### Assistant - 2024-08-28 17:10:14

The FLUX tone is thoughtful, insightful, and reflective, with a focus on complexity and nuance. It acknowledges challenges and risks without being overly pessimistic, and it maintains an optimistic, forward-thinking perspective. The tone encourages curiosity, creativity, and a willingness to explore new ideas, while also emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and adaptability. It balances realism with hope, recognizing the potential for growth and learning even in difficult situations. The overall style is conversational but intellectually engaging, aiming to provoke deep thought and inspire action.

### User - 2024-08-28 17:10:22

Refine this to make it more concise, flow better, and have more of a FLUX tone. Also, do basic copy edits. 

Imagine you're planning a fancy date with your partner — your relationship is going great and you're ready to propose. But the reality is different — your partner intends to break up with you. If your belief about a core relationship is this wrong, the impact is profound, challenging your understanding of yourself and your connection with others. The lens through which you viewed your relationship suddenly seems cracked, and you're forced to confront a new reality.

Every decision we make carries the potential of being right and the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than set us back. They can shake our entire worldview, forcing us to rethink what we believe to be true. These moments, while jarring, offer opportunities for growth if we can recognize the power of the lenses through which we see the world.

One lens is negativity bias, an instinct honed for survival. Because some mistakes have severe consequences, we tend to focus on potential dangers, often at the expense of taking opportunities. While this bias can protect us from harm, it can also lead to paralysis and missed chances. Recognizing this bias allows us to refine our perspective, balancing caution with the courage to move forward.

Another lens is to embrace mistaken beliefs as opportunities to rethink, rebuild, and learn. By accepting the possibility of being wrong, we open ourselves to growth and innovation. This mindset turns challenges into stepping stones, making us more resilient and insightful with each experience. This mindset does not take away the pain of the mistake, but it can change our relationship to it. 

So... despair at one extreme and pollyannaish optimism about self growth at the other? Are these are only choices? We can also look at the odds and consequences of being wrong to get to a more measured assessment.

Suppose I believe there's no tiger in the kitchen and there actually is. In this case, the _consequences_ of my incorrect belief are rather large — instead of getting lunch, I become lunch. However, the probability of my belief being wrong is quite low. 

Now entertain the opposite belief, even if it has no validity in your mind. In this hypothetical, you believe there is a tiger in the kitchen and if you are wrong, there is not. Given that being right means you were mauled by the tiger, the consequences of being wrong don't seem that bad, right? However, we need to look at the opportunity cost. By avoiding the kitchen, we miss out on lunch. 

The critical question is how tightly you should hold your belief and how much you should consider alternatives. If being wrong is both likely and would lead to severe consequences, then it's worth embracing a bit of that negativity bias. If being wrong is very unlikely or the consequences are minor, it's time to embrace that possible growth experience. Factoring in the likelihood of each outcome helps you determine whether to hold onto your belief or adjust it, balancing the risks and rewards.

Of course, the truly existential incorrect beliefs are the ones that sneak up on you. Thinking through your beliefs this way doesn't insulate you from the pain of being wrong. However, by learning to hold all of your beliefs at a slight distance, you can build up habits of resilience that will allow you to react more quickly when you find that you are wrong.

So, as you make decisions—whether personal or professional—remember that the risk of being wrong is also an opportunity to deepen your understanding. Balance caution with creativity, knowing that even when things don’t go as planned, there’s always a chance to learn and discover new paths forward.

Imagine you're planning a fancy date with your partner—your relationship is thriving, and you're ready to propose. But the reality is different—your partner intends to break up with you. If your belief about this core relationship is so off, the impact is profound, challenging your understanding of yourself and your connection with others. The lens through which you viewed your relationship suddenly cracks, forcing you to confront a new reality.

Every decision carries the potential of being right and the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than set us back; they can shake our entire worldview, forcing us to rethink what we believe to be true. While jarring, these moments offer opportunities for growth—if we recognize the power of the lenses through which we see the world.

One such lens is negativity bias, an instinct honed for survival. Because some mistakes have severe consequences, we tend to focus on potential dangers, often at the expense of seizing opportunities. While this bias can protect us, it can also lead to paralysis and missed chances. Recognizing it allows us to refine our perspective, balancing caution with the courage to move forward.

Another lens is to see mistaken beliefs as opportunities to rethink, rebuild, and learn. Accepting the possibility of being wrong opens us to growth and innovation. This mindset doesn’t erase the pain of mistakes, but it can change our relationship to them, turning challenges into stepping stones toward resilience and insight.

But what if there’s a middle ground between despair and blind optimism? We can also assess the odds and consequences of being wrong to reach a more measured judgment.

Suppose you believe there's no tiger in the kitchen, but there actually is. The consequences are severe—you become lunch instead of having lunch—but the probability is low. Now consider the opposite belief: you think there is a tiger, but there isn’t. The consequences of being wrong are minor—you miss a meal—but the opportunity cost is real.

The critical question is how tightly you should hold your belief and how much you should consider alternatives. If being wrong is both likely and carries severe consequences, it’s wise to embrace some negativity bias. But if being wrong is unlikely or the consequences are minor, it’s time to lean into the potential for growth. Evaluating the likelihood and impact of each outcome helps you decide whether to hold onto your belief or adjust it, balancing risks and rewards.

Of course, the most disruptive incorrect beliefs are the ones that sneak up on you. Thinking through your beliefs this way doesn’t shield you from the pain of being wrong. But by learning to hold your beliefs with a bit of distance, you can build habits of resilience, allowing you to adapt more quickly when you find you’re mistaken.

So, as you make decisions—whether personal or professional—remember that the risk of being wrong is also an opportunity to deepen your understanding. Balance caution with creativity, knowing that even when things don’t go as planned, there’s always a chance to learn and discover new paths forward.

### Assistant - 2024-08-28 17:11:14

Imagine you're planning a special date with your partner—your relationship feels solid, and you're ready to propose. But what if reality is different—your partner intends to break up with you? When your belief about something so central is off, it shakes your entire worldview, forcing you to confront a new and unsettling reality.

Every decision we make carries the potential of being right and the risk of being wrong. But some mistakes do more than set us back; they can challenge our deepest beliefs. While these moments are difficult, they also offer opportunities for growth—if we recognize the power of the lenses through which we view the world.

One such lens is negativity bias, an instinct shaped by the need to avoid harm. We often focus on potential dangers, sometimes at the expense of recognizing opportunities. This bias can protect us, but it can also lead to missed chances. By acknowledging it, we can balance caution with the courage to move forward.

But what if there’s a middle ground between despair and blind optimism? Consider the odds and consequences of being wrong. Suppose you believe there’s no tiger in the kitchen, but there is. The consequences are severe—you become lunch instead of having lunch—but the likelihood is low. Now, imagine you think there is a tiger, but there isn’t. The consequences of being wrong are minor—you miss a meal—but there’s still a real opportunity cost.

The critical question is how tightly to hold your beliefs and how much to consider alternatives. If being wrong is both likely and carries severe consequences, some negativity bias might be warranted. But if the chance of being wrong is low or the consequences are minor, it’s time to embrace the possibility of growth. Evaluating both the risks and rewards helps you decide whether to hold onto your belief or adjust it.

Ultimately, the most disruptive mistakes are the ones we don’t see coming. By holding your beliefs with a bit of distance, you can build resilience and adapt more quickly when you’re wrong. So, as you make decisions, remember that the risk of being wrong is also an opportunity to deepen your understanding. Balance caution with creativity, and even when things don’t go as planned, there’s always a chance to learn and find new paths forward.

Dart: Things that take you out of the gene pool are more important

Justin: But if you're a VC spreading your risk, you want people not to pay to much to the chance of being wrong

Dart: Outsourcing being wrong

Wesley: Then survivorship bias

Tigers in kitchens vs sandwiches

Erika: There's also a connection to the way that the black hole at the middle of the cnefin model has changed over time. That points to uncertainty about uncertainty

Justin: Connection the trope of waking up in a video game and understanding the world

Dart: That's interesting because it's a personal view of the model vs the idea of the truly unknowable. Unknown vs unknowable.

Jasen: Can never get rid of the blindspot . Enternal blindspot.

Erika: Eternal blindspot can also be contrasted with cultural blindspot. We think it's eternal, but it's actual a local view.

Wesley: Need many metrics to decide what is an anomoly. Similarly, brainstorming, drawing from across the org helps define normative vs outlier. Poling an individual doesn't tell you this.

Wesley: Input vs output randomness: Output randomness. If you only have one of the idea of the future, you can't tell how anomolous it is. But if you have many ideas, you can see that 8 of the 10 are similar. The other ones are possible, but they're more anomolous.

Erika: Even within those similar outcomes, you can think about your levers of control and if you even care.

Wesley: Possible futures, probably futures, preferred futures. You can hope to change the probable outcome.

Justin: Hope is an interesting word. How much does hope play in the cynefin model? How does it apply to that blind spot. Cynefin is very diagnostic. Doesn't talk about outcomes, hopes, and dreams.

Wesley: Doesn't really relate to preference at all. It's more of a sense making framework than influence. It does make some recommendations on how to behave.

Erika: Going back to what dart was saying, we can then compare where we think we are on cynefin to where we actually are

Erika: Do you know the stakes? Creativity looks attractive in the face of death.

Wesley: Connection to the cone of uncertainty, [Have we written that up as a lens.] More uncertainty further out.

Spencer: The possibilities you think are realistic vs the possibilities that are actually realistic. "We'd need to be top 5" "Yeah, that's our goal". Need to look at the reasonable next possible.

Erika: Want to ;look at the gap between what will keep you alive and your greatest ambition.

Spencer: You want that to be as wide as possible.

Wesley: The nice thing about scenarios is that you can keep the "candy" scenario as one of the options and talk about both of these as possibilities. Feels maybe more tractable.

Spencer: VC process doesn't necessarily choose the right people. Can choose people who are unreasonable even in the face of failure. Need people who can navigate the challenge. Gotta learn how to be a good leader.

Ade: Minimally effective leader: incredibly generative lens

Jasen: What's the developmental ramp for founders? Views parenting as a similar problem. How do help grow kids?

Ade: Recursive leadership could be an answer

Spencer: One challenge is that if you're committed to the wrong thing, you can't be a good leader. Need the humility to decide to do something difference.

Ade: Base case: you must successfully lead yourself before you can successfully lead others.

Spencer: Micromanagement is damaging.

Spencer, summarizing Ade: I think the base action here is self-reflection and a commitment to self awareness

Wesley: For children, it can be useful to frame things in terms of identity, "be a helper"
Spencer: community values at family scale that everyone (parents included) are committed to.

Discussion of conformity:

Ade: Sometimes conformity is more important than problem solving

Spencer: Conformity

Boris: Most non-conformers aren't successful. Steel manning conformism, not sure he believes.

Erika: Conformity as the mechanism of privilege. Conforming to expectations gives you a budget. For some people, conformity is not built in though, so they suffer the costs of non-cormity involuntarily.

Wesley: Conforming can be a tool but not everyone has the same range of conformity available to them.

Lens stacking: 

Here’s what kept me awake tonight. 

It started with the thread can-you-even-cynefin. 



I had never really spent much time considering cynefin before that thread.  “The dark disorder domain in the center represents situations where there is no clarity about which of the other domains apply.”     I started asking myself “how big is that category?” and is there any texture within that category or is it just darkness in there?   

Is there a classification system that can be applied on top of the cynefin classification, that categorizes the ways in which one can be wrong?   I can mistake something as obvious when it is in fact chaotic and so on.  In Flux we often talk about this kind of mistake, but I don’t think we have a method for laying out all the ways one can be wrong. Like this:

(It would be fun to give the most common ways of being wrong more memorable names than letter/number.  I’m not sure about the fails, but A1 could be “OBRA” for “Oh Boy, Right Again” 1)  

Intellectually I know the pandemic is complex. Nonetheless I keep making predictions as if it’s merely complicated. “Vaccines are going to fix everything!” has been my B1 failure.  And I keep going through the duh, B1-to-A1-again head smack. 

This classification system can then drop into a failure modes and effects analysis. Maybe we call this a Dunning-Kruger-FMEA.   

DK-FMEA

Severity if wrong, benefit if right
Detectability
Mitigation or augmentation
Etc.

...etc.













This is where I decided to get out of bed: It’s possible to generalize this method to many other classification schemes:  For instance, it can be applied to the classifications in any problem solving method (PSM). 

Or to any other situational classification.  Just totally picking one out of a hat: Sun Tsu recommends “It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two”2

So this is a kind of lens stacking.  I can stack this lens on top of many other lenses. Are there other ways of stacking lenses?  

Turns out stacks of lenses are called, disappointingly, a "lens"

From wikipedia on cynefin: Confusion
The dark confusion domain in the centre represents situations where there is no clarity about which of the other domains apply (this domain has also been known as disordered in earlier versions of the framework). By definition it is hard to see when this domain applies. "Here, multiple perspectives jostle for prominence, factional leaders argue with one another, and cacophony rules", write Snowden and Boone. "The way out of this realm is to break down the situation into constituent parts and assign each to one of the other four realms. Leaders can then make decisions and intervene in contextually appropriate ways."[2]

### Navigating the Dark Confusion Domain: Understanding the Heart of Cynefin

At the heart of the Cynefin framework lies a domain that is both intriguing and unsettling: the dark confusion domain. This central area, also referred to in earlier versions as the "disordered" domain, represents a state where there is no clarity about which of the other Cynefin domains—complex, complicated, chaotic, or obvious—apply. It’s a space where uncertainty reigns, perspectives clash, and the usual tools for understanding the world fall short.

By its very nature, the dark confusion domain is elusive. It’s challenging to recognize when you’re in it because it lacks the defining characteristics that help distinguish the other domains. As Snowden and Boone describe, this domain is a cacophony of conflicting perspectives, where leaders and thinkers struggle to impose order on chaos. In this space, multiple viewpoints jostle for prominence, and factional leaders argue, each convinced of the correctness of their interpretation.

The real challenge of the dark confusion domain is that it resists easy categorization. It’s a place where the usual rules don’t seem to apply, making it difficult to even begin to understand the situation. This is the domain where you feel lost, where the familiar tools and frameworks that usually guide decision-making seem inadequate. 

But while the dark confusion domain may seem daunting, it’s not without a path forward. The way out is through careful, deliberate action—breaking down the situation into its constituent parts and then assigning each part to one of the other Cynefin domains. This process of decomposition helps to bring clarity to the confusion, allowing leaders to make contextually appropriate decisions and interventions.

In essence, the dark confusion domain isn’t a dead end, but a starting point for deeper analysis. It’s a reminder that not all problems fit neatly into predefined categories, and that sometimes, the first step to understanding is recognizing that you don’t yet understand. By embracing the confusion and methodically working to untangle it, we can transform disorder into actionable insight.

This central domain of Cynefin serves as a powerful metaphor for the unknown and the unknowable. It forces us to confront the limits of our knowledge and the boundaries of our understanding. Yet, it also offers a powerful tool for growth. By recognizing when we are in this domain and applying the right methods to navigate through it, we can emerge with a clearer, more nuanced understanding of the challenges we face. 

In a world that increasingly feels complex and chaotic, the dark confusion domain serves as a crucial reminder: that sometimes, the first step to clarity is acknowledging the confusion and then carefully, methodically finding our way through.

Work in more of this angle:
Is there a classification system that can be applied on top of the cynefin classification, that categorizes the ways in which one can be wrong?   I can mistake something as obvious when it is in fact chaotic and so on.  

And this: Connection to the cone of uncertainty, [Have we written that up as a lens.] More uncertainty further out.

And: There's also a connection to the way that the black hole at the middle of the cnefin model has changed over time. That points to uncertainty about uncertainty

### Navigating the Dark Confusion Domain: Understanding the Heart of Cynefin

At the heart of the Cynefin framework lies a domain that is both intriguing and unsettling: the dark confusion domain. This central area, previously known as the "disordered" domain, represents a state where there is no clarity about which of the other Cynefin domains—complex, complicated, chaotic, or obvious—apply. It’s a space where uncertainty reigns, perspectives clash, and the usual tools for understanding the world fall short.

The dark confusion domain is elusive by design. It’s challenging to recognize when you’re in it because it lacks the defining characteristics that help distinguish the other domains. As Snowden and Boone describe, this domain is a cacophony of conflicting perspectives, where leaders and thinkers struggle to impose order on chaos. In this space, multiple viewpoints jostle for prominence, and factional leaders argue, each convinced of the correctness of their interpretation.

One of the most complex aspects of the dark confusion domain is that it doesn’t just represent confusion—it embodies uncertainty about uncertainty itself. The evolution of Cynefin’s central domain, from "disordered" to "dark confusion," highlights this shift. It suggests that our understanding of uncertainty is itself uncertain and that the boundaries between what we think we know and what is truly unknowable are always in flux. This domain forces us to confront the unsettling reality that even our methods for categorizing the world can fail, leaving us adrift in ambiguity.

A significant challenge within this domain is the risk of misclassification—mistaking something as obvious when it is, in fact, chaotic, or treating a complex problem as merely complicated. The dark confusion domain serves as a reminder that our cognitive biases and assumptions can lead us astray, particularly when we try to apply a framework too rigidly. It raises the question: Is there a classification system that can be applied on top of Cynefin, one that categorizes not just situations but the ways in which we can be wrong? Understanding these potential missteps could be crucial for navigating the uncertainty of this domain.

This brings us to the concept of the "cone of uncertainty," which illustrates how uncertainty expands as we project further into the future. Just as the cone widens, so too does the dark confusion domain remind us that the further we move from what we know, the more we are confronted with the limits of our understanding. The connection here is clear: the center of Cynefin, like the tip of the cone, represents a point of relative clarity, but as we move outward—into complexity, chaos, and confusion—uncertainty grows, and our ability to make confident decisions diminishes.

Yet, the dark confusion domain is not an impenetrable void. It’s a space where, through careful analysis, we can begin to untangle the mess. The way out is to break down the situation into its constituent parts and then assign each part to one of the other Cynefin domains. This process of decomposition helps to bring clarity to the confusion, allowing leaders to make contextually appropriate decisions and interventions.

In essence, the dark confusion domain isn’t a dead end but a critical juncture for deeper analysis. It’s a reminder that not all problems fit neatly into predefined categories and that sometimes, the first step to understanding is recognizing that you don’t yet understand. By embracing the confusion and methodically working to untangle it, we can transform disorder into actionable insight.

### Navigating the Dark Confusion Domain: Understanding the Heart of Cynefin

At the center of the Cynefin framework lies the dark confusion domain, a space where clarity is absent and it's unclear which of the other Cynefin domains—complex, complicated, chaotic, or obvious—applies. This domain embodies uncertainty about uncertainty itself, challenging our assumptions and pushing us to confront the limits of our understanding.

One of the greatest risks in the dark confusion domain is misclassification—believing you’re in one domain when you’re actually in another. For instance, you might think you're in the clear, dealing with an obvious situation where the cause and effect are well understood. But what if reality is more complicated, complex, or even chaotic? Each of these scenarios demands a different approach, and getting it wrong can lead to significant consequences.

If you mistake a complicated situation (which requires expert analysis) for an obvious one, you might oversimplify the problem, missing critical details that could lead to failure. If you believe a complex situation (which has no clear right answer) is merely complicated, you might waste time searching for a solution that doesn’t exist, rather than experimenting and learning from the outcomes. And if you think a chaotic situation (which demands immediate action to restore order) is simple or even complex, you risk exacerbating the crisis by failing to act swiftly and decisively.

The dark confusion domain serves as a critical reminder that our cognitive biases and assumptions can lead us astray. It challenges us to consider not just where we are but also how we might be wrong about where we are. This layer of self-reflection—this meta-classification—adds a new dimension to the Cynefin framework, encouraging us to remain vigilant about the dangers of misinterpretation.

The way forward from confusion isn’t to force clarity where there is none, but to carefully break down the situation, recognize the potential for error, and assign each element to the appropriate domain. By doing so, we can navigate the uncertainties of the dark confusion domain with greater confidence, turning potential missteps into opportunities for deeper understanding and more effective action.

In a world full of complexity and chaos, the dark confusion domain reminds us that sometimes, the first step to clarity is acknowledging that we might not yet understand—and that’s okay. By staying open to the possibility of being wrong, we can better adapt, learn, and ultimately find our way through.

What are 7 concrete examples from flux-relevant domains that could be used to illustrate this confusion?

### Assistant - 2024-08-28 17:41:56

Here are seven concrete examples from FLUX-relevant domains that illustrate the confusion found in the dark confusion domain of the Cynefin framework:

1. **Public Health Crisis Management**:
   - **Example**: During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, many leaders treated the situation as merely complicated—believing that with enough data, the right solutions could be found. In reality, the situation was complex, with evolving variables, unpredictable human behavior, and uncertain outcomes. Misclassifying it led to delayed responses and inadequate measures.

2. **Startups and Product Development**:
   - **Example**: A startup believes that their product is in the "obvious" domain—thinking it's a straightforward solution to a well-defined problem. However, the market turns out to be more complex, with customer needs varying widely and no single clear path to success. This misclassification can lead to premature scaling and eventual failure.

3. **Climate Change Policy**:
   - **Example**: Policymakers often treat climate change as a complicated problem—believing that with the right models and data, a solution can be engineered. However, the issue is complex, with intertwined social, economic, and environmental factors that resist linear solutions. Misjudging this can lead to policies that are ineffective or counterproductive.

4. **Corporate Strategy During Digital Transformation**:
   - **Example**: A corporation assumes that adopting new technology is an "obvious" task, focusing on implementing known best practices. But digital transformation is often a complex challenge, requiring cultural shifts, experimentation, and adaptation. Misclassifying it as obvious can lead to frustration and stalled initiatives.

5. **Conflict Resolution in Organizations**:
   - **Example**: A manager sees an interpersonal conflict as a simple issue of misunderstanding (obvious domain) and applies a standard conflict resolution technique. However, the conflict is rooted in deeper, complex cultural and systemic issues. This misclassification leads to superficial solutions that fail to address the underlying problems.

6. **AI and Algorithmic Bias**:
   - **Example**: Developers believe that improving an AI system is a complicated task, requiring fine-tuning of algorithms based on available data. However, the problem is actually complex, involving ethical considerations, societal impacts, and evolving biases. Misunderstanding this can lead to AI systems that perpetuate or exacerbate inequality.

7. **Crisis Management in Natural Disasters**:
   - **Example**: Authorities treat a natural disaster as a chaotic event requiring immediate response, but once the initial chaos subsides, they fail to transition into managing the situation as a complex problem involving long-term recovery, rebuilding, and psychological impacts. Misclassifying it as ongoing chaos can lead to missed opportunities for structured, adaptive solutions.

Public Health Crisis Management:

Example: During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, many leaders treated the situation as merely complicated—believing that with enough data, the right solutions could be found. In reality, the situation was complex, with evolving variables, unpredictable human behavior, and uncertain outcomes. Misclassifying it led to delayed responses and inadequate measures.

### Navigating the Dark Confusion Domain: Understanding the Heart of Cynefin

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, many leaders treated the situation as merely complicated—believing that with enough data, the right solutions could be found. They assumed that the problem could be solved through expert analysis and well-defined processes. However, the reality was far more complex, with evolving variables, unpredictable human behavior, and uncertain outcomes. This misclassification led to delayed responses and inadequate measures, as leaders struggled to adapt to a situation that defied easy categorization.

This example vividly illustrates the challenges of operating within the dark confusion domain at the center of the Cynefin framework. In this domain, there is no clarity about which of the other Cynefin domains—complex, complicated, chaotic, or obvious—apply. It’s a space where uncertainty reigns, perspectives clash, and our usual tools for understanding the world often fall short.

One of the greatest risks in the dark confusion domain is misclassification—believing you’re in one domain when you’re actually in another. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example: leaders initially treated it as a complicated problem, thinking that with enough data, they could engineer a solution. But the situation was complex, requiring adaptability, experimentation, and the ability to learn from rapidly changing conditions. This misjudgment resulted in actions that were too slow and insufficient for the scale of the crisis.

Misclassification can occur in various scenarios. For instance, you might believe you’re dealing with an obvious situation where cause and effect are well understood, but the reality could be far more complicated, complex, or even chaotic. Each of these scenarios demands a different approach, and getting it wrong can lead to significant consequences. Just as with the pandemic, oversimplifying a problem can result in missed opportunities for more effective solutions.

The dark confusion domain forces us to confront the unsettling reality that our assumptions and cognitive biases can lead us astray. It challenges us to consider not just where we are, but also how we might be wrong about where we are. For instance, during a public health crisis, treating a complex situation as merely complicated can delay critical interventions and worsen outcomes. This layer of self-reflection—this meta-classification—adds a new dimension to the Cynefin framework, encouraging us to remain vigilant about the dangers of misinterpretation.

The way forward from confusion isn’t to force clarity where there is none, but to carefully break down the situation, recognize the potential for error, and assign each element to the appropriate domain. By doing so, we can navigate the uncertainties of the dark confusion domain with greater confidence, turning potential missteps into opportunities for deeper understanding and more effective action.

In a world full of complexity and chaos, the dark confusion domain reminds us that sometimes, the first step to clarity is acknowledging that we might not yet understand—and that’s okay. By staying open to the possibility of being wrong, as illustrated by the early responses to COVID-19, we can better adapt, learn, and ultimately find our way through.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, many leaders treated the situation as merely complicated—believing that with enough data, the right solutions could be found. They assumed that the problem could be solved through expert analysis and well-defined processes. However, the reality was far more complex, with evolving variables, unpredictable human behavior, tribal identification, and uncertain outcomes.

One of the greatest risks in confusion is misclassification. The treatment of the complex phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic as merely complicated is a prime example of one of the most common misclassifications. When we misclassify a complex problem as complicated, we treat it as a problem we can solve with data and engineering rather than a situation which requires adaptability, experimentation, and learning in the face of rapid change. 

Misclassification can occur in various scenarios. For instance, you might believe you’re dealing with a clear situation where cause and effect are well understood, but the reality could be far more complicated, complex, or even chaotic. Or we might treat something as complex when it's clear, leading to excessive solutions for simple problems. Getting the classification wrong can lead to missed opportunities for more effective solutions.

Now from everything here so far, extract the points on "unknown" vs "unknowable" and related concepts, including the cone of uncertainty

### Assistant - 2024-08-28 18:09:32

Here are the extracted points on "unknown" vs. "unknowable" and related concepts:

### Unknown vs. Unknowable
1. **Dark Confusion Domain**:
   - The dark confusion domain in the Cynefin framework embodies a space where it’s unclear which domain—complex, complicated, chaotic, or obvious—applies. It represents uncertainty about uncertainty itself, forcing us to confront the limits of our understanding. This domain challenges our ability to differentiate between the unknown (what we don’t know but could discover) and the unknowable (what we cannot know or predict).

2. **Misclassification Risks**:
   - Misclassifying a situation—believing it’s clear or complicated when it’s actually complex or chaotic—highlights the tension between the unknown and the unknowable. The unknown can often be managed or understood with more information or analysis, while the unknowable remains beyond our reach, leading to potential missteps.

3. **Cone of Uncertainty**:
   - The concept of the "cone of uncertainty" illustrates how uncertainty increases as we project further into the future. Initially, there may be some clarity, but as we move outward—into complexity, chaos, and confusion—uncertainty grows. This widening cone mirrors the transition from unknowns, which may be narrowed down with time and effort, to unknowables, which expand as we try to predict and control the future.

4. **Cultural vs. Eternal Blindspots**:
   - There’s a distinction between cultural blindspots (things we overlook due to our specific cultural context) and eternal blindspots (aspects of reality that are fundamentally unknowable). Cultural blindspots can potentially be uncovered with new perspectives or learning, while eternal blindspots remain beyond our comprehension, representing the unknowable.

5. **Navigating Confusion**:
   - In the dark confusion domain, our challenge is to break down situations into their components to classify them correctly. However, this process is complicated by the fact that some elements may be unknown, while others are truly unknowable, complicating our ability to make informed decisions.

### Related Concepts
- **Unknowns** are things we currently do not know but could potentially learn or discover through analysis, experience, or experimentation.
- **Unknowables** are things that are inherently beyond our capacity to know, predict, or control, no matter how much information we gather or how advanced our methods become.
- **Cone of Uncertainty** emphasizes how predictability decreases as we look further into the future, transitioning from areas where the unknown might be clarified to regions where the unknowable dominates.

### The Limits of Knowing: Navigating the Unknown and the Unknowable

Imagine waking up in a video game. You have no idea where you are or what the rules are, but you’re aware that everything around you operates according to some logic. As you explore, you begin to piece together the mechanics, learning which actions lead to rewards and which to danger. Yet, no matter how much you discover, there are always elements that remain elusive—hidden levels, unpredictable glitches, and outcomes that defy your expectations. This is the difference between the unknown and the unknowable: the former can be uncovered with effort and inquiry, while the latter remains beyond reach, an inherent part of the game’s mystery.

In the real world, we often find ourselves in a similar situation. We navigate through life trying to understand our environment, predict outcomes, and make decisions. Much of what we encounter falls into the category of the unknown—things we don’t yet understand but can potentially learn. However, there are also the unknowables, the aspects of reality that resist all attempts at comprehension, no matter how much information we gather or how advanced our methods become.

This distinction is crucial when we attempt to make sense of the world. The unknown is like that undiscovered part of the game map—eventually, with enough exploration, we can reveal it. We can gather data, conduct experiments, and expand our understanding. The unknowable, however, is like a glitch in the game’s code—something that cannot be predicted or controlled, no matter how much we learn about the game itself.

One way to conceptualize this is through the idea of the "cone of uncertainty." As we project further into the future, the cone widens, reflecting the increasing uncertainty that comes with trying to predict what lies ahead. At the tip of the cone, where we’re closest to the present, the unknowns may still be within our grasp, narrowing down as we gather more information. But as we move outward, toward more distant futures, we encounter the unknowable—outcomes and variables that cannot be anticipated, no matter how much data we have at our disposal.

Cultural and eternal blindspots further complicate our understanding. Cultural blindspots are like those parts of the game we can’t see because of our current perspective—they’re unknown to us now, but with a shift in viewpoint or additional knowledge, we might uncover them. Eternal blindspots, on the other hand, are akin to the unknowable aspects of the game—those that are built into the system’s design and are forever out of our reach. They represent the limits of human understanding, where even our most advanced frameworks and tools fall short.

In this context, the challenge isn’t just to explore the unknown but to recognize the boundaries where the unknown becomes the unknowable. It’s about understanding that while some parts of the "game" can be mapped out with effort, others are designed to remain mysterious, defying any attempt to fully grasp them.

This recognition doesn’t lead to despair but rather to a deeper appreciation of the complexities of the world we navigate. It encourages us to remain curious and adaptable, acknowledging that while we may never fully know everything, the pursuit of understanding is valuable in itself. It also reminds us that humility is essential—acknowledging that some aspects of reality will always be beyond our control or comprehension.

Just as in the video game, where we learn to accept that some secrets will remain hidden, in life, we must balance our quest for knowledge with the understanding that not all can be known. By embracing both the unknown and the unknowable, we can better navigate the challenges we face, finding meaning not just in what we discover, but also in the mysteries that remain.

Change the examples of the "unknowable" in the first paragraph to be "unpredictable glitches, designers intent, what other players will ultimately do". 

Change "The unknowable, however, is like a glitch in the game’s code—something that cannot be predicted or controlled, no matter how much we learn about the game itself." to "The unknowable, however, is like a glitch in the game’s code—something that cannot be predicted or controlled, no matter how much we learn about the game itself — although it can, perhaps, be exploited".

That application of the cone of uncertainty doesn't seem right. Remove that bit for now. 

Change "Cultural and eternal blindspots further complicate our understanding." to "Sometimes what we think is unknowable is actually a matter of perspecitive. While some blindspots are eternal, other cultural blindspots are like those parts of the game..."

While some blindspots are eternal, cultural blindspots are like those parts of the game we can’t see due to our current viewpoint—they’re unknown now, but with a shift in perspective or new knowledge, we might uncover them. Eternal blindspots, by contrast, are akin to the unknowable aspects of the game—those built into the system’s design that we can never fully grasp.

The challenge isn’t just to explore the unknown but to recognize when the unknown becomes the unknowable. While some parts of the "game" can be mapped out with effort, others are meant to remain mysterious, defying any attempt to fully grasp them.

This understanding deepens our appreciation of the world’s complexities. It encourages us to stay curious and adaptable, acknowledging that while we may never fully know everything, the pursuit of understanding is valuable. It also reminds us of the importance of humility—recognizing that some aspects of reality will always be beyond our control.

Just as in the video game, where some secrets remain hidden, in life, we must balance our quest for knowledge with the acceptance that not all can be known. By embracing both the unknown and the unknowable, we can navigate challenges more effectively, finding meaning not just in what we discover, but also in the mysteries that remain.

### Glitches in the Code: Navigating the Unknown and the Unknowable

Imagine waking up in a video game. You have no idea where you are or what the rules are, but you start piecing together the mechanics—learning which actions lead to rewards and which to danger. Yet, some elements remain elusive—unpredictable glitches, the designer’s intent, and what other players will ultimately do. This illustrates the difference between the unknown and the unknowable: the former can be uncovered with effort, while the latter remains beyond reach, an inherent part of the game’s mystery.

In life, we face a similar challenge. We constantly try to understand our environment, predict outcomes, and make decisions. Much of what we encounter is unknown—things we don’t yet understand but can potentially learn. However, there are also the unknowables—those aspects of reality that resist all attempts at comprehension, no matter how much information we gather.

The unknown is like an undiscovered part of the game map—eventually, with enough exploration, we can reveal it. We can gather data, experiment, and expand our understanding. The unknowable, however, is like a glitch in the game’s code—something that cannot be predicted or controlled, no matter how much we learn—although it might be exploited.

Sometimes what seems unknowable is actually a matter of perspective. While some blindspots are eternal, cultural blindspots are like those parts of the game we can’t see due to our current viewpoint—they’re unknown now, but with a shift in perspective or new knowledge, we might uncover them.

From all of this, pull notes and insights about the cone of uncertainty

### Assistant - 2024-08-30 19:43:47

Here are the key notes and insights about the "cone of uncertainty" gathered from the discussion:

### Notes and Insights on the Cone of Uncertainty

1. **Concept of the Cone of Uncertainty**:
   - The "cone of uncertainty" illustrates how predictability decreases as we project further into the future. Initially, we may have some clarity, but as we look further out, uncertainty grows, widening the range of possible outcomes.

2. **Transition from Unknown to Unknowable**:
   - The widening of the cone represents the transition from dealing with unknowns, which can potentially be understood or clarified with more information, to encountering the unknowable, which remains beyond our capacity to fully grasp or predict.

3. **Relationship to the Dark Confusion Domain**:
   - The dark confusion domain in the Cynefin framework, which represents uncertainty about uncertainty itself, aligns with the broader end of the cone of uncertainty. As we move away from what we know, we encounter greater ambiguity, where it becomes harder to distinguish between what is simply unknown and what is fundamentally unknowable.

4. **Application in Decision-Making**:
   - In practical terms, the cone of uncertainty is used to acknowledge the limits of prediction and control, particularly in complex or chaotic situations. It reminds us to approach future projections with humility, recognizing that our ability to foresee outcomes diminishes as we look further ahead.

5. **Link to Misclassification Risks**:
   - Misclassifying a situation can exacerbate the effects of the cone of uncertainty. For example, treating a complex issue as merely complicated can lead to an underestimation of the range of possible outcomes, narrowing the perceived cone when it should actually be widening to accommodate greater uncertainty.

6. **Strategic Implications**:
   - Understanding the cone of uncertainty helps in strategic planning by encouraging flexibility and adaptability. It highlights the need to prepare for a broader range of possibilities rather than focusing on a single predicted outcome, particularly in rapidly changing or unpredictable environments.

7. **Navigating Through the Cone**:
   - As we navigate through the cone of uncertainty, it's important to continuously gather new information, reassess assumptions, and remain open to adjusting our strategies. This ongoing process helps in managing the transition from the unknown to the unknowable, allowing for more informed decision-making even in the face of increasing uncertainty.

Summarize a definition of the cone of uncertainty based on the wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_uncertainty

### Assistant - 2024-08-30 19:44:06

The "cone of uncertainty" is a visual model used to represent the increasing range of uncertainty over time when predicting the future. Initially, the cone is narrow, reflecting a relatively higher confidence in short-term forecasts. However, as time progresses and predictions extend further into the future, the cone widens, illustrating the growing uncertainty and the expanding range of possible outcomes. This concept is often used in project management, forecasting, and risk assessment to acknowledge the inherent unpredictability of long-term projections and the need for flexibility in planning.

Write a concise FLUX lens about the cone of uncertainty

### Assistant - 2024-08-30 19:44:29

### FLUX Lens: The Cone of Uncertainty

#### **Introduction**
In a world full of change and complexity, predicting the future can feel like navigating through fog. The further out you try to see, the blurrier the path becomes. This is where the concept of the "cone of uncertainty" comes into play—a lens that helps us understand and manage the inherent unpredictability of the future.

#### **Core Concept**
The cone of uncertainty is a visual model that illustrates how uncertainty expands as we project further into the future. Imagine a cone starting at a single point in the present, gradually widening as it extends forward. At the narrow end, short-term predictions are relatively clear and reliable. But as the cone widens, the range of possible outcomes increases, reflecting the growing uncertainty inherent in long-term forecasts.

#### **Application**
Using the cone of uncertainty as a lens encourages us to approach planning and decision-making with flexibility. Rather than locking into a single outcome, we recognize that multiple scenarios are possible, especially as we look further ahead. In practical terms, this means preparing for a range of possibilities, building adaptability into strategies, and continuously gathering information to refine predictions as time progresses.

#### **Reflection**
By viewing the future through the cone of uncertainty, we become more comfortable with ambiguity and less likely to be caught off guard by unexpected developments. This lens reminds us that while we can’t eliminate uncertainty, we can navigate it more effectively by staying open to change and ready to adjust our course as new information emerges.

#### **Conclusion**
Embracing the cone of uncertainty allows us to balance confidence with humility—acknowledging that while we can plan, we must also remain adaptable. As you face future challenges, let this lens guide you, helping you to manage uncertainty with grace and foresight.

Give 7 examples in FLUX adjacent spaces that illustrate the cone of uncertainty. Avoid software as an example domain 

### Assistant - 2024-08-30 19:46:37

Here are seven examples from FLUX-adjacent spaces that illustrate the cone of uncertainty:

1. **Climate Change Policy**:
   - Policymakers must make decisions based on long-term climate models, which become increasingly uncertain the further they project into the future. While short-term impacts might be more predictable, the range of possible outcomes widens significantly as predictions extend over decades, complicating policy decisions.

2. **Urban Planning**:
   - City planners often work with forecasts about population growth, infrastructure needs, and technological changes. Near-term projects can be planned with relative confidence, but as they look further ahead—decades into the future—uncertainties about demographic shifts, economic changes, and new technologies make long-term planning more complex.

3. **Public Health**:
   - In managing public health crises like pandemics, the cone of uncertainty is evident in the progression of disease models. Early predictions about the spread of a virus might be relatively accurate, but as time goes on, variables such as public behavior, mutations, and vaccine efficacy introduce greater uncertainty, making long-term planning more challenging.

4. **International Relations**:
   - Diplomats and policymakers must consider the long-term consequences of treaties, alliances, and conflicts. While the immediate outcomes of a diplomatic decision might be clear, the long-term geopolitical landscape can shift in unpredictable ways, influenced by factors like changing leadership, economic trends, and emerging technologies.

5. **Agricultural Forecasting**:
   - Farmers and agricultural planners use weather forecasts and market trends to make decisions about crop planting and resource allocation. Short-term forecasts are generally reliable, but as they project further into the growing season, uncertainties such as unexpected weather patterns, pests, and market fluctuations widen the cone of uncertainty.

6. **Financial Planning and Investment**:
   - Financial advisors and investors use economic indicators to make decisions about asset allocation and risk management. While short-term economic trends might be easier to predict, long-term financial planning is fraught with uncertainties like market volatility, interest rate changes, and global economic shifts.

7. **Education Policy**:
   - Education policymakers plan curricula and funding models based on current trends and needs. While the near-term impact of changes in education policy might be predictable, the long-term outcomes—such as how education aligns with future job markets or societal needs—are much harder to forecast, leading to a broader cone of uncertainty.

#### **Application**
Urban planning offers a clear example of the cone of uncertainty in action. City planners must make decisions about infrastructure, transportation, and housing based on current trends and forecasts. While they can predict near-term needs with some confidence, planning decades into the future is far more complex. As they look further ahead, uncertainties about population growth, technological advancements, and economic shifts widen the cone, making long-term planning a more challenging and adaptable process.

Using the cone of uncertainty as a lens encourages us to approach planning and decision-making with similar flexibility. Rather than locking into a single outcome, we recognize that multiple scenarios are possible, especially as we look further ahead. In practical terms, this means preparing for a range of possibilities, building adaptability into strategies, and continuously gathering information to refine predictions as time progresses.

While they can predict near-term needs with some confidence, looking decades into the future is far more complex. Uncertainties about population growth, technological advancements, and economic shifts widen the range of possible outcomes, making long-term planning a challenging and adaptable process.

This concept is captured by the "cone of uncertainty"—a visual model that illustrates how uncertainty expands as we project further into the future. Imagine a cone starting at a single point in the present, gradually widening as it extends forward. At the narrow end, short-term predictions are relatively clear and reliable. But as the cone widens, the range of possible outcomes increases, reflecting the growing unpredictability that comes with long-term forecasting.

Let's narrow the example down to something like: "How much transit does a city need 50 years from now and what kind? 25 years from now? 5 years from now? 1 year from now? Uncertainties about population growth, technological advancements (e.g., self driving cars), and economic shifts widen the range of possible outcomes, making long-term planning a challenging and adaptable process."

### Assistant - 2024-08-30 19:50:11

In urban planning, a common challenge is figuring out how much transit a city will need in the future—and what kind. How much transit will the city need 50 years from now? What about 25 years? 5 years? Even just 1 year from now? Uncertainties about population growth, technological advancements (like self-driving cars), and economic shifts widen the range of possible outcomes, making long-term planning a challenging and adaptable process.

This scenario perfectly illustrates the "cone of uncertainty"—a concept that helps us understand how unpredictability grows as we look further into the future. Imagine a cone starting at a single point in the present, gradually widening as it extends forward. At the narrow end, short-term predictions are relatively clear and reliable. But as the cone widens, the range of possible outcomes increases, reflecting the growing uncertainty of long-term forecasts.

Viewing the future through the cone of uncertainty encourages flexibility in planning and decision-making. Rather than locking into a single outcome, it’s essential to recognize that multiple scenarios are possible, especially as we look further ahead. This means preparing for a range of possibilities, building adaptability into our strategies, and staying ready to adjust as new information emerges.

By adopting the cone of uncertainty as a lens, we become more comfortable with ambiguity and less likely to be caught off guard by unexpected developments. It reminds us that while we can’t eliminate uncertainty, we can navigate it more effectively by staying open to change and adjusting our course as needed. This approach helps us balance confidence with humility, acknowledging that while we can plan, we must also remain adaptable.

I don't have the ability to directly view or analyze images. However, if you describe the font or provide some context about where the image comes from (e.g., a brand, a specific design style), I can help you identify the font or suggest similar fonts. You can also use online tools like WhatTheFont or FontSquirrel Matcherator by uploading the image to those websites to identify the font.

The image you provided uses two different fonts:

1. **The hand-written style font used in phrases like "expert logician," "android at a party," "gut logic," and "fight or flight"** resembles a font called **Luna** or **Patrick Hand**. These fonts have a casual, handwritten feel with smooth curves and a slightly playful aesthetic.

2. **The more structured, serif-style font used for "WE BELIEVE WE'RE USING" and "ACTUALLY USING"** resembles a font like **Avenir** or **Montserrat**, particularly in a light or thin weight. This font is clean, modern, and easy to read, contrasting with the handwritten font.

If you're looking to replicate the exact fonts, using Luna for the handwritten text and Avenir or Montserrat for the structured text should give you a very similar look.

Okay, what ideas from the original notes have I not developed into pieces yet? 

### Assistant - 2024-08-30 20:15:32

Here are some ideas from the original notes that you haven't fully developed into pieces yet:

1. **The Unknown vs. The Unknowable**:
   - **Note**: Discussion about the difference between unknowns (what we don’t know but could discover) and the unknowable (what we cannot know or predict).
   - **Potential Piece**: Explore how these concepts apply in decision-making, risk assessment, and strategy, using examples like startup environments or technological innovation.

2. **Survivorship Bias**:
   - **Note**: Wesley mentioned how survivorship bias is connected to outsourcing risk and the implications of being wrong.
   - **Potential Piece**: Write a piece on how survivorship bias affects decision-making, particularly in contexts like venture capital, leadership, or innovation. How does focusing only on successes skew our understanding and lead to flawed strategies?

3. **Cultural vs. Eternal Blindspots**:
   - **Note**: Erika mentioned contrasting eternal blindspots with cultural blindspots—some things we think are unknowable might actually just be a matter of perspective.
   - **Potential Piece**: Develop an essay on the concept of blindspots in decision-making and strategy, exploring how to identify and mitigate them, and how understanding cultural vs. eternal blindspots can lead to better outcomes.

4. **Connection to the Cone of Uncertainty**:
   - **Note**: Erika suggested a connection to the way the black hole at the middle of the Cynefin model has changed over time, pointing to uncertainty about uncertainty.
   - **Potential Piece**: You could explore the evolution of frameworks like Cynefin in understanding uncertainty, how our comprehension of "uncertainty about uncertainty" has evolved, and its implications for strategic planning.

5. **Recursive Leadership**:
   - **Note**: Ade mentioned the idea of recursive leadership—leading yourself effectively before leading others.
   - **Potential Piece**: Write about the concept of recursive leadership, focusing on how self-leadership forms the foundation for effective team or organizational leadership. Include practical steps for developing self-awareness and leading by example.

6. **Identity Framing in Leadership**:
   - **Note**: Wesley talked about framing things in terms of identity, like "be a helper," especially for children, and the idea of community values at the family scale.
   - **Potential Piece**: Explore how framing leadership and behavior in terms of identity (e.g., "be a problem-solver" or "be a learner") can influence team dynamics, organizational culture, and personal development.

7. **Hope in the Cynefin Model**:
   - **Note**: Justin mentioned that the Cynefin model is very diagnostic but doesn’t talk about outcomes, hopes, or dreams.
   - **Potential Piece**: Consider writing about where hope and aspirations fit within diagnostic frameworks like Cynefin. How can these frameworks incorporate positive, forward-looking elements like hope to inspire better outcomes?

These ideas provide fertile ground for further exploration and could result in thoughtful, insightful pieces that align with the FLUX ethos.
