I have reports who are split 3/3/3 across 3 different teams. I want to meet with them biweekly. What are the pros and cons of meeting will all of the folks on one team in the same week vs splitting folks from the same team across different weeks?

When scheduling biweekly meetings for reports split across three different teams, there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Here's a breakdown:

**Meeting with All Folks from One Team in the Same Week**:

*Pros*:

1. **Consistency**: All members of one team get the same message at roughly the same time, which can streamline communication and reduce chances of miscommunication or information asymmetry.
2. **Team Cohesion**: When all members of a team meet in the same week, there's an opportunity to address team-specific issues, foster team spirit, and discuss matters pertinent to their collective objectives.
3. **Efficiency**: With all members from one team in a single week, it's easier to track feedback, concerns, or tasks specific to that team.
4. **Better Preparation**: Managers can focus on preparing for one team's concerns and challenges each week, rather than juggling multiple teams' issues at once.

*Cons*:

1. **Lack of Cross-Team Interaction**: If reports don't have the opportunity to interact with members from other teams, silos might develop.
2. **Potential Overwhelm**: Handling all concerns of one team in a short span might be taxing and may limit the depth to which certain issues can be explored.
3. **Potential Delays**: If something urgent comes up in the subsequent week, that team will have to wait until the next cycle for a collective addressal.

**Splitting Folks from the Same Team Across Different Weeks**:

*Pros*:

1. **Cross-Team Synergy**: Mixing teams can allow for a cross-pollination of ideas and might break down silos. This encourages collaboration and broader thinking.
2. **Diverse Feedback**: A mixed group can provide diverse feedback on universal company initiatives, processes, or challenges.
3. **Spread of Load**: By spreading out team members, managers might face a more even distribution of issues and concerns over the weeks, which can be less overwhelming.
4. **Quick Issue Resolution**: If there's an urgent issue that affects multiple teams, it can be addressed sooner with a mix of representatives available each week.

*Cons*:

1. **Communication Challenges**: Splitting teams might lead to members receiving messages or updates at different times, potentially leading to information gaps.
2. **Less Team-Specific Discussion**: With a mixed group, the focus might lean more towards general topics rather than team-specific challenges or tasks.
3. **Preparation Overhead**: Managers might need to prepare for a broader range of topics each week due to the mixed audience.
4. **Potential for Dominance**: If one team's issues dominate a meeting, members from other teams might feel overlooked or undervalued.

In the end, the best approach depends on the specific goals you have for the meetings and the nature of the teams and their tasks. Consider what you aim to achieve with these biweekly check-ins and weigh the pros and cons accordingly.
