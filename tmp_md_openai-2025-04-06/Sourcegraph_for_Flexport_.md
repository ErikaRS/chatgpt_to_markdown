I am a former employee at a company and I want to reach out to them about buying my current company's product, an AI coding assistant and code search platform. Key points I want to convey to this person are below. Help me compose a friendly email that aims to get a conversation started.

- Understand you were interested in Sourcegraph, but it wasn‚Äôt the right time
- I‚Äôm at Sourcegraph now and would love to help you look into and adopt Sourcegraph.
- We just launched Cody, so Sourcegraph might be more relevant than ever if you‚Äôre looking into AI assistants for your team.
- Relevant use cases based on my experience at Flexport:
- Sourcegraph users report saving 10-30 minutes each day by using Sourcegraph
- Help devs onboard to unfamiliar code without slowing down sr. devs and managers as Flexport doubles eng headcount this year
- Help devs find what they‚Äôre looking for across repos, which is otherwise a challenge at Flexport
- I have the ear of our sales leaders and they are willing to give you a ‚Äúfriends and family‚Äù deal and make it very very easy to get started from a commercial perspective

Subject: Catching Up and Exploring Sourcegraph's AI Coding Assistant for Flexport

Hi [Former Colleague's Name],

I hope you're doing well! It's been a while since we last spoke, and I wanted to reconnect with you. I recently joined Sourcegraph, and I remembered our conversations about your interest in our platform. I understand that back then, it wasn't the right time for Flexport to adopt Sourcegraph. However, I'm excited to share that we've made some significant updates, and I believe it might be the perfect time to revisit this possibility.

Firstly, I wanted to tell you about our newly launched AI coding assistant, Cody. Cody is designed to streamline coding tasks and save valuable time for developers. Since I know Flexport is always looking for ways to improve efficiency, I thought Cody might be a particularly relevant addition to your team.

Based on my experience at Flexport, I believe Sourcegraph can be incredibly valuable in a few key areas:

1. Time savings: Our users report saving 10-30 minutes each day by using Sourcegraph.
2. Onboarding support: As Flexport doubles its engineering headcount this year, Sourcegraph can help new developers familiarize themselves with unfamiliar code without burdening senior devs and managers.
3. Cross-repo search: Sourcegraph makes it much easier to find code across multiple repositories, which I know can be a challenge at Flexport.

Additionally, I've spoken with our sales leaders, and they're eager to offer Flexport a special "friends and family" deal. This means we can make it incredibly easy for you to get started from a commercial perspective.

I'd love to set up a time for us to catch up and discuss how Sourcegraph and Cody could benefit Flexport. Let me know when you're available, and we can schedule a call or meeting at your convenience.

Looking forward to reconnecting and exploring this opportunity with you!

Best regards,

[Your Name]

Here is my draft of this email. How could I make it even clearer and to the point while retaining my voice?

Hello Geoff! 

How have things been at Flexport these days? I know there‚Äôs been a lot of change. 

I managed to land well after the layoffs and am now at Sourcegraph. So I‚Äôll admit up front that my email isn‚Äôt just out of a desire to reconnect. 

I have heard from some folks on our sales team that you‚Äôve shown some previous interest in Sourcegraph. I know that we were working on reducing our software outlay so I understand then was not the right time for Flexport to adopt Sourcegraph. That said, with all of the excitement around AI coding assistants, which we‚Äôre right at the forefront of, I wanted to revisit this possibility with you. 

The big excitement is that our newly launched AI coding assistant, Cody. Cody is designed to streamline coding tasks and save valuable time for developers. Since I know Flexport is aiming to double the engineering team, I thought Cody might be a good way to help folks ramp up quickly.

Based on my experience at Flexport and my challenges discovering all of the different github repos and figuring out how the systems all fit together, I believe Sourcegraph can provide some value. Our users report saving 10-30 minutes each day using Sourcegraph. It‚Äôs especially valuable for new employees. It also makes it easy to set up contexts which help engineers find code in the right repositories quickly.

I've spoken with our sales leaders, and they're eager to offer Flexport a special "friends and family" deal. This means we can make it incredibly easy for you to get started from a commercial perspective.

If you think Cody and Sourcegraph could be valuable to Flexport, let me know, and I can set up some time to chat! If not, I‚Äôd still love to catch up and hear all the gossip üòÄ. 

Looking forward to reconnecting and exploring this opportunity with you!

Have a lovely day!

This is an email to a different former coworker. This coworker was the architecture lead and we interacted with peers. He is very technically skilled and interested in doing things right. 

I am a former employee at a company and I want to reach out to them about buying my current company's product, an AI coding assistant and code search platform. Key points I want to convey to this person are below:

- I‚Äôm at Sourcegraph now and thought you‚Äôd find Sourcegraph useful.
- Architects love Sourcegraph since it helps them understand their entire codebase and drive and measure standards & practices across the codebase
- Could you check it out and let me know of your feedback? Would greatly appreciate it!

I know you care a lot about architecture and helping people do things the right way, so I thought you‚Äôd appreciate some of the things Sourcegraph has to offer.

Try locally with the Sourcegraph App
Try with a free enterprise trial instance

I can also help coordinate a demo with my colleagues James and Dan (jclifford@sourcegraph.com, dan.diemer@sourcegraph.com). 

If you think Cody and Sourcegraph could be valuable for Flexport, let's set up a time to chat. Otherwise, I'd still love to catch up and hear all the gossip üòÄ.

No, I don't want you to write the email for me. I want you to tell me which of the goals I met and which I could do better on.

### Assistant - 2023-05-03 14:05:38

My apologies for misunderstanding your request. Here's the feedback on the email you provided based on the goals you mentioned:

Goals met:
1. You mentioned that you're now at Sourcegraph, which helps set the context for the conversation.
