Revise this to keep the friendly, personal tone while making it more actionable and consise:

Hello! It was so great seeing you at alumni weekend... although I'm still feeling somewhat shocked that only a few profs from my day are still around. ðŸ™ƒ

I wanted to follow up on the conversation about encouraging AI coding assistant usage in CS5. What were you thinking that might look like? I'd love to figure out how I and/or Sourcegraph can help.

If your thinking was to expose students to AI coding assistants generally, I'd be happy to help provide an overview of the different ones out there (write something up, record a video, or other creative options). Other than using Cody for any demo that was part of that, there wouldn't be any particular Sourcegraph content.

If you were leaning more toward encouraging students to use a particular assistant (at least as a default), then I'd love to talk a bit more about what that might look like if that were Cody. Right now, we have 3 tiers (free, pro, and enterprise), where the main difference between free and pro is usage limits. We don't currently have a student tier or student discount on pro, but it's something we've been discussing adding, so a concrete use case could be a good motivator.

Let me know how I can help! And best wishes with the last couple weeks before summer.

Hello! It was great seeing you at alumni weekend, though I'm still amazed how few of our old professors are still around! ðŸ™ƒ

Iâ€™m following up on our chat about integrating AI coding assistants into CS5. How do you envision that happening? Iâ€™m eager to explore ways Sourcegraph and I can support this.

If the goal is to introduce students to various AI assistants, I can compile an overview of the options availableâ€”through a written summary, video, or another creative format. For any demo, Iâ€™d use Cody, but the focus would remain broad without specific promotion of Sourcegraph.

If, however, you're considering recommending a specific assistant like Cody as the primary tool, I'd love to discuss this further. Currently, Cody has three tiers: free, pro, and enterprise, with the main difference being usage limits. We're contemplating a student discount for the pro tier, and a partnership could be the perfect catalyst for this.

Let me know how I can assist! Best wishes for the bustling weeks leading up to summer.
