I am being promoted from director of engineering at a small company to interim head of all engineering. I have one hour tomorrow with my new boss and the CEO to discuss what I need to be successful. Our key challenges are rebuilding trust after a chaotic and rather opaque planning cycle and helping the eng team to be effective. The CEO knows of these problems and expects me to find solutions.

My goal is to help the org be as effective as possible.

What are some topics I could put on the agenda? What are some questions I can ask?

Sure, it sounds like a critical meeting where you need to address important issues and establish your action plan. Here are some suggested topics for your agenda:

1. **Clarity on Expectations and Objectives**: Make sure you understand what the CEO and your new boss expect from you in this new role. Ask for clarity on any specific goals or objectives they have in mind.

2. **Resource Assessment**: Discuss the current status of your team and the resources available. This includes human resources, technology, and budget.

3. **Team Dynamics and Morale**: Discuss the current morale and the relationships within the team. Ask what measures have been taken in the past to boost morale and what worked or didn't.

4. **Communication Channels and Transparency**: Bring up the issue of the previous chaotic planning cycle. Discuss ways to improve communication and transparency in future planning and execution.

5. **Strategy for Trust Rebuilding**: Share your thoughts on how to rebuild trust, and ask for their input. This might include more open communication, recognition of good work, or team-building activities.

6. **Productivity and Efficiency**: Discuss ways to help the team be more effective. This could involve process improvements, technology upgrades, or additional training.

7. **Leadership Support**: Ask for support from leadership for your plans and initiatives. This might include backing for new processes, funding for resources, or simply vocal support for cultural changes.

Here are some potential questions you could ask:

1. What are your expectations for this role in the next quarter and the next year?

2. Are there resources we could leverage to help the engineering team be more effective?

3. How have we been addressing team morale in the past? What has worked and what hasn't?

4. What are your thoughts on improving transparency and communication in our planning and execution?

5. How can we better support our team in achieving our goals?

6. What kind of support can I expect from leadership as I transition into this role and implement changes?

Remember, your primary goal here is to ensure everyone is on the same page and you have the necessary backing to address the key challenges in your new role. Good luck!

Given that I have more background in pure engineering leadership and very little in business leadership, what are some questions I should ask to help align the engineering team with the business goals?

### Assistant - 2023-07-31 21:08:47

That's a great point. Aligning the engineering team with business goals is crucial for success. Here are some questions you could ask:

1. **Understanding Business Goals**: Can you clarify the primary business goals for the next quarter/year? How do these goals translate into objectives for the engineering team?

2. **Product Vision**: What is the overall product vision and how does it align with our business strategy? This will help you understand the big picture and guide your team accordingly.

3. **Metrics**: What key performance indicators (KPIs) does the company use to measure business success? How can we tie engineering team performance to these KPIs?

4. **Collaboration**: How can we improve cross-functional collaboration between engineering and other teams such as product, sales, and marketing?

5. **Customer Perspective**: Can you share insights from customer feedback, market trends, and competitor analysis? How can we use this information to prioritize our engineering tasks?

6. **Value Creation**: How can the engineering team contribute most effectively to value creation? What kind of projects or initiatives would have the most significant impact on our business goals?

7. **Resource Allocation**: Based on business priorities, how should we allocate our engineering resources?

Remember, the aim here is not just to understand the business goals, but also to find ways to translate those goals into specific objectives for your team. This will enable your team to make a meaningful contribution to the overall success of the company.
