Rephrase this sentence in a way that doesn't use the word "even" twice. Keep the original phrasing as much as possible: "We can even thank the obscuring masks for their role of protection â€” even as we wait for the day when we can grind them off to restore our full sparkle."

We can express gratitude to the obscuring masks for their protective role, while anticipating the day when we can remove them and regain our complete radiance.
