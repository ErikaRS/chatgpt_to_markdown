When traveling from the US West Coast to Europe, you're likely facing a significant time difference of about 8 to 9 hours ahead, depending on your specific destination in Europe. To help adjust your internal clock and combat jet lag, you can use melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Here are general guidelines on when to take melatonin for this type of travel:

### A Few Days Before Departure
- **Start Adjusting Your Sleep Schedule**: Gradually shift your bedtime earlier, closer to the time zone of your destination. This might mean going to bed 1-2 hours earlier each night for a few days before your flight.

### On The Day of Travel
- **Avoid Taking Melatonin in the Morning or Early Afternoon**: Since your goal is to adapt to the new time zone, taking melatonin too early might make you sleepy at the wrong time.
  
### Upon Arrival or During the Flight (If It's Nighttime at Your Destination)
- **Take Melatonin Close to Bedtime at Your Destination**: If it's nighttime in Europe when you're ready to sleep on the plane or have just arrived, you can take melatonin to help adjust. The recommended time is 30 minutes to an hour before the local bedtime.

### Dosage and Timing
- **Dosage**: The typical dose is between 0.5 mg and 5 mg, depending on individual sensitivity and the product's instructions. Start with a lower dose to assess your tolerance.
- **Timing**: Aim to take melatonin at what would be bedtime in your destination's time zone, even if you're still on the plane. Continue this for a few days after arrival to help reset your internal clock.

### Important Considerations
- **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: Before using melatonin, especially if you're on medications or have health conditions that could be affected.
- **Use as Part of a Strategy**: Combine melatonin use with exposure to natural light during the day at your destination to help further adjust your body's internal clock.

Adjusting to a new time zone can take a day per hour of time difference, so patience and a gradual adjustment plan are key. Melatonin can be a helpful part of this adjustment, especially when used thoughtfully and in combination with other jet lag management strategies.
