What are easy, healthy snacks for someone with braces? A lot of my gotos (trail mix / nuts) are off my list and other (raw carrots, apples) require enough pre-cutting to make them no longer easy

Here are some easy and healthy snack options that work well for someone with braces:

1. **Soft fruits**: Bananas, berries, grapes, or sliced peaches and pears (canned in juice, if you prefer a softer texture).
2. **Yogurt**: Greek yogurt with soft toppings like honey or mashed berries for added flavor.
3. **Cheese**: String cheese or cheese cubes are soft and easy to eat.
4. **Smoothies**: Blend fruits like bananas, strawberries, or spinach with some yogurt or milk for a quick, nutritious option.
5. **Hummus and soft dippers**: Try hummus with soft pita bread, cucumber slices, or soft bell pepper strips.
6. **Avocado**: You can eat it on its own or spread it on soft bread or a tortilla.
7. **Boiled eggs**: A great protein-rich option thatâ€™s easy to prepare ahead of time.
8. **Soft granola bars**: Choose softer varieties or granola bars specifically designed to be easy on the teeth.

These snacks should be gentle on your braces and still offer plenty of nutrition!
