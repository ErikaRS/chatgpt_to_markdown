The old set of values is:
Customer-first: You earn and keep the trust of our customers by putting their interests first.
Work as a team: You work collaboratively with your peers, cross-functional teammates, and leadership to create shared success, trust, and belonging.
High agency: You have the power and the responsibility to improve Sourcegraph as a company and as a product. You deliver regardless of the circumstances.
High quality through iteration: You are responsible for defining and building high quality work iteratively.
Be welcoming and inclusive: You make people from all groups and backgrounds feel comfortable belonging to our team and community.
Open and transparent: You proactively communicate in an open and transparent way.
Continuously grow: You strive to continuously grow and learn by genuinely soliciting feedback early and often, and humbly reflecting on your past mistakes.


The new set of values is:
Dev-first: Everything we do is ultimately for devs. Every dollar we earn comes from devs trying, using, loving, fighting for, and spreading our product. Everyone here codes, to better understand our users and customers and to do their job better (in whatever ways make sense for their role).
Ambition: We are here to do the best work of our lives and have a huge impact, which requires end-to-end accountability, hard work, fast iteration, optimism in the face of challenges, and changing quickly when needed.
Ownership: We're all owners here, and we improve and protect Sourcegraph together even in ways that are not explicitly part of our job. We act in the best interest of Sourcegraph overall.
Direct and open: We respect each other and trust we can all handle candid feedback, disagreements, and open access to information. We are willing to disagree and commit. We welcome and include each other, and when there's conflict, we engage in respectful, direct conversations.

Given these sets of values give feedback on:
1. What overlap there is between the old and new values. Mention the specific values and how they relate to each other.
2. What was present in the old values that is missing from the new values. Be specific about either overall values that are missing or aspects from description of the values that are missing.
3. What new ideas the new values introduce.

### Assistant - 2023-05-04 13:45:08

1. Overlap between the old and new values:
   - "Customer-first" and "Dev-first": Both emphasize the importance of the user, with the old set focusing on the customer, while the new set emphasizes developers specifically. Both aim to put the users' interests first.
   - "Work as a team" and "Ownership": Both express the idea of collective responsibility and collaboration. The new value of "Ownership" goes further, implying a broader sense of responsibility towards the company, not just the team.
   - "Be welcoming and inclusive" and "Direct and open": Both sets of values include a commitment to inclusivity and open communication. The new values emphasize the concept of directness and respectful disagreements.
   - "Open and transparent" and "Direct and open": Both sets of values value openness and transparency, with the new values also emphasizing the importance of directness in communication.
   - "Continuously grow" and "Ambition": Both of these values reflect a desire for personal and professional growth, with the new value of "Ambition" adding a focus on high impact work and fast iteration.
  
2. What is missing from the new values:
   - "High agency": The new values don't explicitly mention the power and responsibility of individuals to improve Sourcegraph as a company and as a product. This might be implied in "Ownership", but it's not stated as clearly.
   - "High quality through iteration": While "Ambition" talks about fast iteration, the focus on high quality and defining and building high-quality work iteratively is missing in the new values.
   - The old values have a stronger emphasis on trust, both in terms of earning and keeping the trust of customers and creating trust within the team. This aspect is not explicitly mentioned in the new values.

3. New ideas introduced in the new values:
   - "Everyone here codes": This new concept suggests that everyone in the company, regardless of their role, should engage in coding to some extent. This aims to improve understanding of users and customers and to enhance job performance.
   - "End-to-end accountability": This is a new concept that emphasizes individual accountability for the entire process or project, from start to finish.
   - "Hard work, fast iteration, optimism in the face of challenges, and changing quickly when needed": These are more specific behaviors associated with "Ambition" that were not present in the old values.
   - "We're all owners here": The new values introduce the idea that everyone in the company has a stake in its success, and should act in the best interest of Sourcegraph overall.
   - "We are willing to disagree and commit": This new concept encourages respectful disagreement and commitment to decisions once they are made, facilitating more efficient decision-making and conflict resolution.

How might we combine the "work as a team" value and "be welcoming and inclusive" value into something that is consistent with the new set of values while capturing the emphasis on trust, shared success, creating a community?

### Assistant - 2023-05-04 13:49:44

A possible way to combine these values, maintaining the emphasis on trust, shared success, and creating a community, could be:

"Unified Ownership and Inclusivity": We are all owners at Sourcegraph, collectively responsible for its success. We work together, valuing and leveraging our diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We create a trusting and inclusive community, fostering a sense of belonging and shared success. We respect each other, engage in direct, open conversations, and handle candid feedback and disagreements with grace. We commit to decisions once made and work towards the betterment of Sourcegraph as a whole.

### User - 2023-05-04 13:50:14

What if you took the set of new values as is and just added one additional value that captures the ideas of trust, shared success, creating a community?

### Assistant - 2023-05-04 13:50:32

Certainly, you can add an additional value that encompasses the ideas of trust, shared success, and community creation, while still aligning with the overall tone of the new values. Here's a suggestion:

"Trust and Community Building": We strive to foster a strong, trusting community where everyone feels they belong. We uphold transparency and direct communication, cultivating an environment of mutual trust. Our shared success is built on the collective contributions of all members, who are valued for their unique perspectives and strengths. We stand together to face challenges, celebrate victories, and continuously strive for the betterment of Sourcegraph.

### User - 2023-05-04 13:51:36

Can you revise it to give a more pithy label (like "dev-first", "ambition", "ownership", "direct and open" -- preferably something that that could be used to finish a sentence "We are...") and to make the description overlap less with the "direct and open" value?

### Assistant - 2023-05-04 13:51:52

Absolutely, we can do that. A more succinct label that fits with the style of the other values could be "Communal Trust". Here's a revised description:

"Communal Trust": We are a tight-knit community, bound by trust and shared success. We value each member's unique contributions, fostering a sense of belonging and collective achievement. Our strength lies in our unity and the trust we place in each other to act in the best interest of Sourcegraph.

### User - 2023-05-04 13:53:00

What's a version that doesn't use the word "communal" which is sometimes a negatively associated word in corporate settings? Also, update the description to remove the overlap with ownership.

### Assistant - 2023-05-04 13:53:09

Certainly, I understand the concern. Let's try "Unified Success" as the core value. Here's a revised description:

"Unified Success": We believe in fostering an environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging and is recognized for their unique contributions. Our shared triumphs stem from this diversity and mutual respect. Trust permeates our interactions as we collectively strive for excellence, celebrating each victory as a testament to our unified success.

### User - 2023-05-04 13:54:15

What label would work with if we wanted each value to be able to fit after we are. E.g., "We are dev-first" "We are ambitious" "We are owners" "We are direct and open"

### Assistant - 2023-05-04 13:54:25

Understood, in that case, a suitable label might be "Trust-Builders". This fits the "We are..." format and also succinctly captures the essence of the value. Here's a revised description:

"Trust-Builders": We build an environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging and is recognized for their unique contributions. Our shared triumphs stem from this diversity and mutual respect. Trust permeates our interactions as we collectively strive for excellence, celebrating each victory as a testament to our community strength.

### User - 2023-05-04 13:55:03

Can you rephrase that to feel more at home in a capitalistic environment where terms like belonging and inclusion might be looked at askance by some folks?

### Assistant - 2023-05-04 13:55:15

Certainly, here is a revision that emphasizes trust and shared success in a more capitalistic context:

"Trust-Builders": We are an interconnected team, where every individual's contribution is vital to our collective success. We recognize and respect the unique value each member brings, and our shared triumphs are a testament to our combined efforts. Trust is the cornerstone of our interactions, fostering effective collaboration and mutual accountability as we strive for Sourcegraph's continued growth and excellence.

### User - 2023-05-04 13:57:35

Let's update that to focus less on the unique value individuals bring and more on the community building aspect. Something that says, that we help each other and we value and build psychological safety (although preferably without using that jargony term)

### Assistant - 2023-05-04 13:57:52

Absolutely, here's an alternative that emphasizes community building and mutual support:

"Trust-Builders": We are a cohesive unit, working towards our shared goals. Our success is built on the trust we cultivate within our team, enabling us to support and uplift each other in our endeavors. This strong foundation of trust encourages open dialogue, fosters resilience, and propels us towards the collective growth and excellence of Sourcegraph.
