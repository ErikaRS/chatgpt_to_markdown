Sure, think of nuclear power as a giant kettle being boiled by atoms splitting apart instead of a fire. Inside a nuclear power plant, there's a special kind of fuel called uranium, which is really good at breaking apart when it gets hit by tiny particles. When uranium atoms split, they release a lot of heat. This heat is used to turn water into steam, just like boiling water on a stove. The steam then pushes the blades of a big fan called a turbine, and as the turbine spins, it generates electricity. Just like a windmill can turn wind into electricity, the nuclear power plant turns the energy from splitting atoms into electricity that can power our homes and schools.

Write it at a late elementary school level. Don't assume the reader knows what atoms are.

Nuclear power is like a super-strong version of the sun that we can create on Earth to make electricity. Inside a power plant, there are tiny pieces of stuff called uranium. When these tiny pieces crash into each other, they break apart and make a lot of heat. We use this heat to boil water to make steam, just like when you see steam rising from a pot on the stove. The steam then pushes on the blades of a big wheel, making it spin really fast. This spinning wheel is connected to a machine that makes electricity for us to use in our homes, schools, and other places. So, in a way, a nuclear power plant is like a big electric generator that uses the power of tiny broken pieces to light up our world!
