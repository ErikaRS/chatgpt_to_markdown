I'm giving some sensitive feedback. The person I am giving feedback to called me the "company mom" in a complementary way, but, as the third person in the room pointed out privately after, it was still in appropriate. All three of us are members of the executive team. I am the only woman out of the three of us. Please give feedback on the feedback draft below:

Hey, I wanted to reach out about the "company mom" comment. I took it in the spirit intended — that I'm responsible and help others be so too — but as Steve pointed out, it's the sort of thing that others could be uncomfortable with, so I wanted to let you know that a more gender-and-family-role neutral phrasing would be better for next time. Also, I mentioned it to <HR partner 1> and <HR partner 2> so that they're informed. 

Thoughts?

Your feedback draft is a good start, but it can be refined for clarity and impact while maintaining a professional tone. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Directly Address the Issue**: Start by directly addressing the comment and why it's problematic. This sets a clear context for the feedback.

2. **Explain Personal Perception vs. General Perception**: Clarify the difference between how you personally perceived the comment and how it might be perceived in a broader, professional context. This distinction helps the recipient understand that while the intent was not malicious, the impact can still be inappropriate.

3. **Suggest Alternative Behavior**: Provide a suggestion for more appropriate behavior or language in the future. This is constructive and helps prevent similar situations.

4. **Mention HR Involvement More Tactfully**: Be careful about how you mention involving HR. This can be perceived as escalating the situation, so it might be better to frame it as a general policy discussion rather than a specific complaint.

5. **Maintain a Cooperative Tone**: Ensure your tone is cooperative and focused on mutual respect and understanding, rather than accusatory.

Revised Draft:

"Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss the 'company mom' comment you made recently. I understand and appreciate that it was meant as a compliment, highlighting my role in fostering responsibility and support within our team. However, I feel it's important to address how such language, while well-intentioned, might be perceived in a professional setting.

Terms like 'company mom' can inadvertently reinforce gender stereotypes and might be uncomfortable for some. In our leadership roles, it's crucial that we set an example by using language that is gender-neutral and professionally appropriate. Moving forward, I suggest we focus on descriptors that reflect our professional contributions without alluding to gender or family roles.

Also, I've shared this feedback with our HR partners, <HR partner 1> and <HR partner 2>, not as a formal complaint but as part of our ongoing discussion about inclusive language and workplace culture. This is to ensure we are all aligned in fostering a respectful and inclusive environment.

Thank you for understanding, and I'm confident that together, we can continue to build a positive and professional workplace culture.

Best regards,
[Your Name]"
