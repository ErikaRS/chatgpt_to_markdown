It appears you're referencing a method typically used in programming, more specifically in search systems, but without further context it's difficult to give a precise explanation.

Assuming the context of a search system, the `QueryToZoektQuery` function would probably convert a general query into a format that the Zoekt search engine understands. This could involve formatting, tokenization, or other modifications.

Here's a generic explanation of what the arguments could mean:

1. `b.query`: This could be the search query that you want to convert.
2. `b.resultTypes`: This could be the types of results that you're interested in (like files, lines, repositories, etc.)
3. `b.features`: This could refer to additional features or search options, such as case sensitivity, exclusivity, etc.
4. `typ`: This might be specifying the type of the search, such as literal, regexp, structural, etc.

However, without knowing the exact implementation of the method, these are just educated guesses. For the precise workings of this method, you'd need to refer to the documentation or the source code of the relevant software or library. It might be part of an internal API or library, as a quick search doesn't show any widely used library or tool with this method as of my last training cut-off in September 2021.

Also, it's important to remember that in most programming languages, method calls like `zoekt.QueryToZoektQuery` would not work because `b.query`, `b.resultTypes`, `b.features`, and `typ` are not defined in this scope. You would typically define or get these variables before passing them into the method. The variable `b` is presumably an object that contains the properties `query`, `resultTypes`, and `features`. The variable `typ` needs to be defined separately.
