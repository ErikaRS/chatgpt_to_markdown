Make this more concise:
I was chatting with @David Veszelovszki about impact reviews the other day and he was surprised that people other than an IC's direct manager were regularly looking at stats about PRs during calibration. 

I'd love for us to make it clearer in the handbook that reviews should include pointers to concrete artifacts produced by folks during the cycle and that during calibration other managers may also look at those and artifacts. These artifacts may include PRs merged / issues closed, documents created, and artifacts of collaboration (e.g., issues, slack). 

My challenge is that I'm not quite sure where the best place to put this is. Today, our impact review cycle, writing guide, and calibration prep docs all are mostly generic across departments. 

What would be a good place to clarify what artifacts the calibration group looks at during calibration? 

(((Side note: It's reasonable to ask, "should we make this clearer? isn't it obvious?" I think that for folks who have not been involved in calibration sessions, it's not obvious to what degree the conversations take the manager's description at face value vs the degree to which the group really digs into individual performance to make sure we're setting a consistent standard. 

Presented well, I think sharing this information has the potential to help people understand that calibration is a thoughtful process where we try to really understand each individual's performance. Presented badly, a message like this can make people feel micromanaged. So it's important that we present this information well. But I think it is important to present it.)))

I recently discussed impact reviews with David Veszelovszki and learned he was unaware that people besides an IC's direct manager often examine PR stats during calibration. I think our handbook should clearly state that reviews should refer to specific artifacts from the cycle, which may be reviewed by other managers during calibration. These can include PRs, closed issues, documents, and collaboration evidence like Slack interactions.

I'm uncertain where best to include this in our documentation, as our impact review cycle, writing guide, and calibration prep docs are generally uniform across departments. Where would be the most effective place to detail the artifacts used in calibration?

Additionally, while it might seem obvious to some, many who haven't participated in calibration may not realize the extent to which these sessions scrutinize individual performance to maintain consistent standards. It's vital to convey this information effectively to avoid perceptions of micromanagement, showing that calibration is a thorough process aimed at understanding each individual's performance.
