Combine the insights from the books Collaborative Intelligence and 5 Dysfunctions of a Team

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:20:46

"Collaborative Intelligence: Thinking with People Who Think Differently" by Dawna Markova and Angie McArthur and "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" by Patrick Lencioni are two highly regarded books on the subjects of collaboration, team performance, and leadership. Below is an attempt to combine insights from both:

1. **Trust and Appreciation for Diversity**: Both books stress the importance of trust, but approach it from different angles. In "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team," Lencioni sees the lack of trust as the root of all team problems. On the other hand, "Collaborative Intelligence" emphasizes the appreciation for diverse ways of thinking, which builds trust. By understanding and valuing the different ways each team member thinks and processes information, trust is established and teams function more effectively.

2. **Fear of Conflict and Constructive Disagreement**: Fear of conflict is one of Lencioni's five dysfunctions. He suggests that teams should engage in passionate, unfiltered debate around issues. Markova and McArthur support this idea, emphasizing that diversity of thought can lead to constructive disagreement, which when managed well, leads to more innovative solutions.

3. **Commitment and Shared Understanding**: For Lencioni, commitment is all about clarity and buy-in. Teams that have confidence in their decisions commit to them. In "Collaborative Intelligence", the authors propose that shared understanding can only be achieved through mindful communication. By understanding each other's thinking, teams can commit to a course of action even if there is initial disagreement.

4. **Avoidance of Accountability and Collective Responsibility**: Lencioni suggests that when teams do not commit to a clear plan of action, even the most focused and driven individuals hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team. "Collaborative Intelligence" complements this by proposing that teams need to develop shared responsibility, where every team member feels responsible for the outcome and holds each other accountable.

5. **Inattention to Results and Focus on Collective Outcomes**: The final dysfunction that Lencioni points out is inattention to results, where team members put their individual needs (such as ego, career development, recognition) above the collective goals of the team. This aligns well with "Collaborative Intelligence's" focus on collective outcomes, achieved by harnessing diverse thinking for common goals.

In conclusion, the insights from both books point towards a more nuanced understanding of team dynamics. The key seems to be in creating an environment of trust, encouraging constructive disagreement, ensuring commitment through shared understanding, instilling a sense of collective responsibility, and focusing on shared goals rather than individual agendas.

Name 3 leadership books from before 2000 that have stood the test of time

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:21:23

Sure, here are three leadership books published before 2000 that have remained influential and relevant over time:

1. **"The Art of War" by Sun Tzu** (Approximately 5th century BC): While it's an ancient military treatise, the timeless strategies described by Sun Tzu are often applied to business and leadership contexts. The book explores principles such as the importance of strategic planning, knowing one's enemy, and the power of deception.

2. **"How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie** (1936): This classic work is often regarded as a foundational text in interpersonal skills and leadership. The principles Carnegie laid out in his book, such as showing genuine interest in others, remembering people's names, and making others feel important, are as relevant today as they were when first published.

3. **"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey** (1989): This book presents a holistic approach to leadership and personal development. Covey's seven habits, which include being proactive, beginning with the end in mind, and seeking to understand before being understood, provide a framework for effective leadership and have stood the test of time.

Each of these books provides timeless wisdom and insight into leadership, people management, and personal growth, remaining impactful and widely-read even decades after their original publication.

Name three more focus on the 1980s and 1990s

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:22:00

Certainly! Here are three more leadership books published in the 1980s and 1990s that have remained influential over time:

1. **"Leadership Is an Art" by Max De Pree** (1989): This book has been appreciated for its humanistic approach to leadership. De Pree, former CEO of Herman Miller, presents leadership as a kind of stewardship, emphasizing the importance of building relationships, utilizing the abilities of team members, and the art of self-evaluation. 

2. **"On Becoming a Leader" by Warren Bennis** (1989): Bennis, a renowned leadership scholar, explores the traits that define leadership and the path to becoming a leader in this book. He discusses the importance of learning from experiences and stresses the role of self-expression, self-awareness, and self-assessment in effective leadership.

3. **"Emotional Intelligence" by Daniel Goleman** (1995): While not exclusively a leadership book, Goleman's exploration of emotional intelligence has had a significant impact on the way we perceive leadership. The book's principles have been applied to leadership theory and practice, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills in leaders.

These books from the 1980s and 1990s continue to offer valuable insights on leadership, helping shape the development of leaders across various fields.

What leadership beliefs were common 20 years ago but have fallen out of favor

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:22:53

Leadership styles and approaches evolve over time, influenced by shifts in societal values, advances in technology, and changes in the nature of work. Here are a few leadership beliefs that were more common 20 years ago (around 2003) but have since fallen out of favor:

1. **Command-and-Control Leadership**: This style of leadership, also known as autocratic leadership, was much more prevalent two decades ago. It involved leaders making all decisions, with little to no input from team members. However, this style has fallen out of favor, replaced by a more democratic and inclusive approach that values the input and feedback of all team members.

2. **Work-Life Separation**: Leaders used to believe that personal and professional lives should be kept strictly separate. Nowadays, with the rise of remote work and the growing understanding of mental health's importance, there's an increasing acceptance of the idea that personal and professional lives are interconnected. Leaders now tend to show more empathy and understanding towards their team's personal situations.

3. **Leaders are Born, Not Made**: The belief that leadership qualities are innate and that some people are just "natural-born leaders" was once widespread. However, this has been largely replaced by the understanding that leadership skills can be developed and honed through practice, experience, and training.

4. **Leaders Must Have All the Answers**: Two decades ago, there was more expectation that leaders should be the most knowledgeable individuals in their organizations and have solutions to all problems. This belief has shifted. Today's leaders are seen as facilitators and collaborators who don't necessarily have all the answers but can guide their teams to find solutions together.

5. **One Size Fits All Leadership**: There was a belief that leadership principles were universal, and the same leadership style could be applied to all situations. Now, the prevailing thought is that effective leadership is context-dependent and requires a flexible, adaptable approach.

These changes reflect a broader shift toward more democratic, empathetic, and adaptable leadership styles that are better suited to the complexity and rapid change of the modern working world.

For each of these ideas, describe when and how the beliefs changed from the old paradigm to a new one

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:23:47

1. **Command-and-Control Leadership**: The transition from autocratic to more democratic leadership styles has been gradual and influenced by various factors. As businesses have become more complex and global, a top-down approach is often too rigid to respond effectively to rapid change. Moreover, employees in knowledge-based economies value autonomy and the opportunity to contribute their ideas. The rise of tech companies with flat hierarchies and the influence of younger generations (Millennials and Gen Z) who prefer collaborative environments have also contributed to this shift. This change started gaining momentum in the late 20th century and has continued into the 21st century.

2. **Work-Life Separation**: The blurring of work-life boundaries began with technological advancements that allowed people to work from anywhere and at any time. The arrival of smartphones and high-speed internet made it possible for work to permeate personal life and vice versa. This trend was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with a global shift to remote work leading to a reevaluation of work-life balance. Organizations and leaders began to recognize the importance of supporting employees' wellbeing not just in a professional context but also considering their personal circumstances.

3. **Leaders are Born, Not Made**: The belief that leadership can be developed emerged in the late 20th century with the rise of leadership development programs and the study of leadership as a distinct field. Research in psychology and organizational behavior began to highlight the role of experience and learning in shaping effective leaders. Over the past couple of decades, the belief in "natural-born leaders" has been further eroded by the rise of various leadership models and frameworks that emphasize the learnable and adaptable nature of leadership skills.

4. **Leaders Must Have All the Answers**: The shift from the leader-as-expert to the leader-as-facilitator started becoming prominent with the rise of complex, knowledge-based industries where expertise is widely distributed across the team. As technology and business environments rapidly evolved in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it became clear that no single person could have all the answers. Consequently, leadership started to be seen more as the ability to leverage the collective knowledge and skills of a team.

5. **One Size Fits All Leadership**: The belief in context-dependent leadership started to take hold in the latter part of the 20th century. The rise of theories such as situational leadership, which emphasizes the need for leaders to adapt their style to the development level of their followers, played a key role in this shift. As organizations and workforces became more diverse, and as businesses faced a wide range of challenges, the importance of flexible, adaptable leadership became clear. This trend has continued to gain traction in the 21st century, with an increasing emphasis on individualized leadership.

Each of these shifts represents a change in understanding that reflects the increasing complexity, diversity, and rapid pace of change in the modern working world.

Now what are some popular leadership ideas from that period that people would be surprised to learn have fallen out of favor?

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:25:19

Even some popular leadership ideas from the early 2000s may have fallen out of favor due to shifts in our understanding of what effective leadership looks like in a rapidly changing, globalized world. Here are a few examples:

1. **The Heroic Leadership Model**: The idea of the leader as the singular visionary and savior of a company was quite popular around the turn of the century. The 'dotcom' boom was full of such stories. However, in recent years, there's been a growing recognition that this kind of hero worship can lead to a lack of accountability, overconfidence, and excessive risk-taking. Today, more emphasis is placed on humility, collaboration, and distributed leadership.

2. **Workaholism as a Virtue**: There was a time when being the first to arrive and the last to leave was seen as a mark of a good leader. Leaders often wore their workaholism as a badge of honor. But this has changed with the growing awareness of the importance of work-life balance, mental health, and the risks of burnout. Now, leaders are encouraged to model healthy behaviors and promote balance for their teams.

3. **Leadership is Reserved for the Top**: In the past, leadership was often associated with senior positions, implying that only those at the top of the organizational hierarchy could be leaders. This idea has fallen out of favor as companies now promote a culture of leadership at all levels, recognizing that anyone can exhibit leadership qualities and influence others, regardless of their formal role in the organization.

4. **The Idea of "Failure is Not an Option"**: In the early 2000s, the notion that effective leaders and their teams should avoid failure at all costs was widely accepted. Today, the perspective has shifted to view failure as an important part of learning and innovation. This is especially prevalent in tech industries and start-ups, where the motto "fail fast, fail often" suggests that quick iterations and learning from mistakes can lead to eventual success.

5. **The 'Know-it-All' Leader**: The rapid pace of technological advancement and the complexity of modern business has rendered the idea of a leader who has all the answers obsolete. Today, effective leaders are seen as lifelong learners who acknowledge what they don't know, value the expertise of their team members, and are willing to seek input from others.

These shifts underscore the evolution of leadership from a rigid, hierarchical model to one that's more flexible, inclusive, and attuned to the well-being of individuals and teams.

What is the current leadership orthodoxy?

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:26:29

As of the mid-2020s, the following concepts have become prominent in leadership orthodoxy:

1. **Transformational Leadership**: This style of leadership involves inspiring and motivating employees to exceed their usual performance, while also promoting their professional growth and development. Transformational leaders typically build strong relationships with their teams and align the goals of the individual with the goals of the group and the organization.

2. **Servant Leadership**: Servant leadership focuses on prioritizing the needs of the team over the needs of the leader. This style promotes collaboration, trust, empathy, and ethical use of power. The servant leader’s role is to serve others by providing guidance and resources to help them achieve their fullest potential.

3. **Emotional Intelligence**: Today’s leaders are expected to be emotionally intelligent – that is, they need to be aware of, control, and express their own emotions, and also handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically. Emotional intelligence is crucial for understanding and managing team dynamics and for effective decision-making.

4. **Leadership Agility**: Given the pace of change in today's world, there's a growing emphasis on the importance of leadership agility. Agile leaders are able to think and act swiftly, adapt to changing circumstances, and lead their teams through uncertainty.

5. **Inclusive Leadership**: In today's diverse workforce, there's an emphasis on inclusive leadership, which involves ensuring that all team members feel they are treated respectfully and fairly, are valued and sense that they belong, and are confident and inspired. Inclusive leaders appreciate and leverage the diverse perspectives of their team.

6. **Purpose-Driven Leadership**: This form of leadership involves a clear focus on a purpose that goes beyond financial profit. Purpose-driven leaders aim to deliver value to all stakeholders - including customers, employees, communities, and the environment - and they strive to make a positive impact on society.

7. **Leaders as Coaches**: Instead of commanding and controlling, modern leaders often take a coaching role, supporting their team members in their professional development and helping them to learn and grow. This involves providing feedback and guidance, asking powerful questions, and helping team members to unlock their potential.

These trends represent the current orthodoxy in leadership, but it's worth noting that effective leadership is highly context-dependent and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best leaders are those who can adapt their style and approach to meet the needs of their team and the situation at hand.

What are the criticisms of this orthodoxy?

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:27:29

While the current leadership orthodoxy has gained widespread acceptance due to its focus on empathy, inclusivity, adaptability, and purpose-driven goals, it is not without its criticisms. Some of these include:

1. **Idealistic and Difficult to Achieve**: Some critics argue that the modern leadership ideals, such as being a transformational, agile, and servant leader all at once, can be daunting and even paradoxical. For instance, being emotionally supportive while also driving performance can be a delicate balance to strike. 

2. **Overemphasis on Collaboration**: While collaboration is undoubtedly important, critics argue that an excessive focus on consensus can lead to decision-making paralysis and suppress healthy dissent. There can be situations where a decisive, authoritative approach may be more effective.

3. **Lack of Focus on Results**: Critics of the servant leadership model, in particular, argue that by focusing too heavily on the needs of the team, leaders might neglect the performance and outcome-oriented aspects of their role. They suggest a balance between people-oriented and task-oriented leadership.

4. **The Risk of Over-Inclusion**: While inclusive leadership is crucial in today's diverse workplaces, critics caution against efforts to include so many perspectives that decision-making becomes slow and cumbersome. Inclusivity should not come at the expense of efficiency.

5. **Potential for Exploitation**: Some people worry that the emphasis on emotional intelligence can lead to manipulation if leaders use their understanding of people's emotions for their own advantage rather than for the benefit of the team or individual.

6. **Unsustainability of Constant Agility**: Critics suggest that constant agility and adaptability can lead to burnout, as teams are continually expected to shift focus, learn new skills, and adapt to new situations.

7. **Purpose Misused**: While being purpose-driven can be highly motivating, there is a risk that "purpose" becomes a buzzword or a marketing tool rather than a genuine guiding principle. This can lead to cynicism among employees if they perceive a disconnect between a company's stated purpose and its actions.

Despite these criticisms, it's worth noting that every leadership style and approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and effectiveness can depend heavily on the context and the specific individuals involved. The key is to adapt and find a balance that works best for each unique situation.

What the the dominant leadership viewpoints today? What would each think of the orthodoxy?

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:29:20

In the mid-2020s, several leadership viewpoints are dominating the discourse. These include transformational, servant, and inclusive leadership, which are all part of the current orthodoxy, along with a few other notable perspectives:

1. **Agile Leadership**: This viewpoint focuses on adaptability, learning, and responsiveness. Agile leaders are generally supportive of the current orthodoxy, given their emphasis on adaptability and continuous learning aligns with transformational and servant leadership principles.

2. **Authentic Leadership**: Authentic leaders emphasize honesty, transparency, and staying true to one's values. They would generally agree with the current orthodoxy, particularly its focus on emotional intelligence and purpose-driven leadership. However, they might caution against the potential for leaders to lose their authentic selves in trying to conform too strictly to the prescribed leadership models.

3. **Transactional Leadership**: Transactional leaders focus on clear roles, tasks, and rewards for performance. This viewpoint may have some disagreements with the current orthodoxy. While they might value certain elements such as emotional intelligence and agility, they could argue that the emphasis on servant and transformational leadership overlooks the importance of structure, clear expectations, and performance-based rewards.

4. **Leadership based on Emotional Intelligence**: Leaders with this viewpoint place high importance on self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. They would strongly align with the current orthodoxy, particularly the focus on emotional intelligence, inclusive, and servant leadership.

5. **Sustainable Leadership**: This perspective emphasizes long-term thinking, stakeholder inclusivity, environmental responsibility, and ethical decision-making. Sustainable leaders would likely appreciate the current orthodoxy's emphasis on inclusive and purpose-driven leadership but might want a stronger focus on sustainability and ethical considerations.

Remember, none of these viewpoints are mutually exclusive, and effective leaders often draw on elements from each, depending on the situation and their individual style. The debate and exchange between these different perspectives can also help to enrich the leadership field and promote ongoing learning and development.

What are current leadership views that contrast more with the current orthodoxies?

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:30:32

While many current leadership views align with the orthodoxy to a large extent, there are some that offer more contrast or critique:

1. **Machiavellian Leadership**: This view, based on the ideas presented by Niccolò Machiavelli in his work "The Prince", suggests that it is better for leaders to be feared than loved, if they cannot be both. Such leaders often use power and control, manipulation, and strategic alliances to maintain their positions. This style is very much at odds with the current orthodoxy's emphasis on servant, inclusive, and empathetic leadership.

2. **Laissez-Faire Leadership**: Laissez-faire leaders take a hands-off approach, allowing team members to make many decisions on their own. While this style may promote autonomy and self-direction, it could be seen as lacking the guidance and support emphasized in transformational and servant leadership models of the current orthodoxy.

3. **Charismatic Leadership**: Charismatic leaders use their personal charm and communication skills to inspire and motivate their teams. While charisma can be a positive trait, this style may sometimes focus too heavily on the leader as an individual, contrary to the current orthodoxy's emphasis on distributed leadership, inclusivity, and serving the team.

4. **Narcissistic Leadership**: Narcissistic leaders, characterized by self-centeredness and a grandiose view of their own talents, are often contrasted with the humility and empathy encouraged in current leadership orthodoxy. While such leaders can sometimes drive high performance, their approach often leads to toxic work environments.

5. **Results-Only Leadership**: Leaders with this approach focus primarily on outcomes and results, sometimes at the expense of interpersonal relationships or work-life balance. This can be seen as contrary to the current emphasis on servant leadership, emotional intelligence, and care for the well-being of the team.

6. **Autocratic Leadership**: Autocratic leaders make decisions without consulting their teams. While this can be efficient in certain situations, it contradicts the orthodoxy's focus on collaboration, shared decision-making, and respect for the contributions of all team members.

These contrasting viewpoints help to illustrate the wide range of approaches to leadership. Effective leaders typically adapt their style depending on the specific context and needs of their teams, drawing on a variety of these views as needed.

What are the rare criticisms of the leadership orthodoxy?

### Assistant - 2023-05-25 21:31:16

While the current leadership orthodoxy, emphasizing transformational, servant, emotionally intelligent, agile, inclusive, and purpose-driven leadership, is widely embraced, it does face some criticisms. Although some of these criticisms have been addressed, others are less frequently raised and hence can be considered as rare:

1. **Cultural Universality**: One of the rare criticisms of the current leadership orthodoxy is that it may reflect predominantly Western cultural values. The focus on individual development, inclusive decision-making, and purpose beyond profit may not resonate in the same way across different cultural contexts.

2. **Effort to Meet the Ideal**: The new models of leadership, particularly transformational and servant leadership, set a high bar for leaders. Not every leader may possess the wide range of skills and attributes required. This raises concerns about whether these expectations are realistic and attainable.

3. **Measurement and Evaluation**: Assessing leadership effectiveness under the current orthodoxy can be challenging. While it's easier to measure task performance under transactional leadership, assessing attributes like emotional intelligence, inclusivity, or the ability to inspire can be more subjective.

4. **Overemphasis on Flexibility**: While agility is prized in today's rapidly changing business environment, the call for constant adaptability might lead to instability and lack of consistent direction. 

5. **Potential to Overlook Constructive Conflict**: While promoting harmony and inclusivity, leaders might inadvertently suppress dissent and constructive conflict, which can be essential for innovation and growth.

6. **Purpose Ambiguity**: While purpose-driven leadership is largely seen as positive, there might be challenges around defining and aligning everyone behind a common purpose, especially in large, diverse organizations.

These rare criticisms don't necessarily invalidate the current leadership orthodoxy, but they do suggest areas where it could be nuanced, developed, or applied more thoughtfully to take account of these potential challenges.
