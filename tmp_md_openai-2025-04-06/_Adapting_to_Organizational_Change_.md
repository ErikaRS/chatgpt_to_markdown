The working name of the article below is "Getting lost to thrive". Suggest a title which points to the content of the article while conveying a hopeful message. 

In the face of constant change, all organizations eventually face the need to adapt. Why is this harder for some organizations than others? Why do some seem temporarily lost while others appear genuinely sick, unable to find purchase on the changing reality?

Change often negatively impacts our sense of purpose, leaving us feeling lost. Being lost is not a bad thing – it’s the nature of life in a changing environment. With the growing pace of change, every organization is a little bit lost. Regaining that sense of purpose makes us feel less lost. As long as we keep searching, we will likely find ourselves again – often in a surprising new form. When we have found this renewed sense of purpose, we can thrive again. 

A sick organization also lacks a sense of purpose. However, it is no longer able to reorient – even if it wants to. A sick organization gets in its own way, letting its entrenched beliefs block the path to reinvention. Being lost becomes the accepted norm. Our inability to let go of what we believe about ourselves shows up as our actions coming in conflict with our wishes. We might resolve to become lean, saying all the right things… and our spending increases yet again. 

A sick organization is highly attached to some sense of self. Maybe it’s a mission or a technology stack or a process or a business model. Whatever it is, there is something that the organization cannot let go of. Most likely, this something once helped the organization to be successful. They specialized by becoming highly attached to something that drove greater effectiveness. However, when the inevitable change comes, the organization does not know how to let go. It shifts from efficiently specialized to sick: still attached to something that is increasingly disconnected from a viable sense of purpose. 

An organization that is lost can also become sick. Uncertainty can cause us to grasp onto anything that provides a sense of stability. We give into our pride, “this is what made us great” and what was just one signal among many at the time becomes central to our identity in the present. We create organizational myths – people were 10x more effective back then! – and we selectively forget that these myths were not representative. 

Just like sick people, sick organizations need help. They need something, usually from the outside, which reveals the truth and holds them accountable to the hard work of healing. More often than not, the moment of truth comes in the form of a further shock to the system – one that could be fatal to the organization. It is on the brink of survival that serious questions are asked and difficult choices made. An organization can only heal by letting go of the things it holds sacred. Those are the things that kept it unwell. 

However, that is only the first step. Letting go allows an organization to move from sickness to lostness, a critical but not sufficient step. To thrive, an organization needs to regain its sense of purpose. To do this, an organization needs to examine its principles, practices, and cultural beliefs, discern the ones that hold it back, and let go of them. It needs to look at what has changed around it and understand how to be successful in this new world. Only then can it reinvent itself to adapt to the change and thrive.

In the face of constant change, all organizations inevitably need to adapt. Why is this harder for some organizations than others? Why do some seem temporarily lost while others appear genuinely sick, unable to find purchase on the changing reality?

Change often negatively impacts our sense of purpose, leaving us feeling lost. But being lost isn't a bad thing – it's a natural part of life in a changing environment. As the pace of change grows, every organization experiences a bit of lostness. Embracing this uncertainty opens doors for growth and innovation. As long as we keep searching, we're bound to find ourselves again – often in a surprising new form. When we rediscover our sense of purpose, we can thrive once more.

A sick organization also lacks a sense of purpose, but unlike a lost organization, it can't reorient itself. Sick organizations cling to entrenched beliefs, hindering reinvention. Be it a mission, technology stack, or business model, there's something the organization can't let go of – often something that once brought success. If an organization fails to release these attachments, it shifts from specialized to sick, remaining attached to something increasingly disconnected from a viable purpose.

Lost organizations can become sick as well. Uncertainty may lead us to grasp anything offering stability. Pride takes over, and past successes become central to our present identity. We create organizational myths and selectively forget their unrepresentative nature.

To heal, sick organizations need external intervention to reveal the truth and hold them accountable. Often, a shock to the system forces the organization to confront difficult choices. Healing begins by letting go of the sacred – the very things that kept it unwell.

Letting go is just the first step. An organization must move from sickness to lostness, embracing uncertainty. To thrive, it must regain its sense of purpose by examining its principles, practices, and cultural beliefs, and releasing those that hold it back. By understanding the changing world, an organization can reinvent itself and adapt to change, ultimately thriving in the new landscape. By embracing this journey, organizations can unlock their full potential and create a brighter future for all stakeholders.
