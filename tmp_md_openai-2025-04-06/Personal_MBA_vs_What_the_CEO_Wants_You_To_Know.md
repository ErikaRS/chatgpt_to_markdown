Comparing and contrasting "What the CEO Wants You to Know" by Ram Charan and "The Personal MBA" by Josh Kaufman involves looking at their themes, approaches, content focus, and target audiences. Both books aim to enhance business understanding and skills, but they do so from different angles.

### Themes and Focus

**"What the CEO Wants You to Know"**:
- This book distills the fundamental principles of business and what drives companies' successes in a manner that mirrors what CEOs understand and utilize.
- It focuses on core business concepts like cash generation, return on assets, and growth, emphasizing the universal laws of business that apply regardless of industry or geography.
- The book is particularly aimed at simplifying complex business concepts for readers to understand what drives a company's performance from a CEO's perspective.

**"The Personal MBA"**:
- Kaufman's book is a comprehensive overview of the business concepts and practices necessary to start, manage, and grow a business.
- It covers a wide range of topics, including value creation, marketing, sales, negotiation, management, and systems thinking.
- The emphasis is on self-education, arguing that a traditional MBA is not necessary to be successful in business.

### Approach and Style

**"What the CEO Wants You to Know"**:
- Charan's approach is to break down the insights into digestible chunks that can be applied regardless of one's position within an organization.
- The book is concise and focuses on the essence of what makes businesses successful, using real-world examples to illustrate points.

**"The Personal MBA"**:
- Kaufman opts for a broader educational approach, providing a self-contained course on mastering the fundamentals of business.
- The book is more of a comprehensive guide that covers a broader spectrum of business topics than Charan's, designed to give readers a solid foundation in business essentials.

### Target Audience

**"What the CEO Wants You to Know"**:
- Aimed at professionals at all levels who wish to understand the core principles of business from a CEO's perspective.
- It's particularly useful for those looking to grasp the financial and operational drivers of business success.

**"The Personal MBA"**:
- Targeted at aspiring entrepreneurs, business students, and professionals who want a broad understanding of business practices without the expense of a traditional MBA.
- It appeals to those looking for a comprehensive, self-directed business education.

### Conclusion

While both books aim to educate on business principles, "What the CEO Wants You to Know" is more focused on understanding the core drivers of business success from a high-level perspective, making complex concepts accessible. "The Personal MBA," on the other hand, offers a broad, self-guided tour of business fundamentals, designed to replace or supplement a traditional MBA program. The choice between the two would depend on one's specific learning goals: gaining a CEO's insight into business success or acquiring a broad, practical business education.

The books "What the CEO Wants You to Know" by Ram Charan and "The Personal MBA" by Josh Kaufman can be seen as both complementary and, to a lesser extent, redundant, depending on the reader's objectives and background in business. Here’s how:

### Complementary Aspects

1. **Depth vs. Breadth**: Charan's book provides depth in understanding the core principles of business as seen from a CEO's perspective, focusing on what drives a company's success. Kaufman's book offers breadth, covering a wide range of business topics. Together, they offer a comprehensive view of business from both a strategic and operational perspective.

2. **Conceptual Understanding vs. Practical Application**: "What the CEO Wants You to Know" helps readers grasp fundamental business concepts that underlie strategic decisions, while "The Personal MBA" provides tools and techniques for applying business principles in various situations. This combination can be powerful for someone looking to not only understand business concepts but also apply them.

3. **Focus on Core Principles vs. Broad Overview**: Charan focuses on core principles that CEOs must understand to lead effectively, which complements Kaufman's broader approach to a business education. For someone in a leadership role or aspiring to one, understanding both the core principles and the broader business landscape can be invaluable.

### Redundant Aspects

1. **Overlap in Fundamental Concepts**: Both books cover fundamental business concepts such as value creation, financial metrics, and growth strategies. This overlap might seem redundant to readers with existing business knowledge or those looking for highly specialized information.

2. **General Business Education**: Both aim to provide a foundational business education, which might lead to some redundancy in content for readers already familiar with basic business principles.

### Conclusion

For individuals new to business or those seeking to broaden their understanding, the two books are largely complementary. "What the CEO Wants You to Know" can deepen one’s understanding of the core drivers of business success, while "The Personal MBA" provides a broad, practical framework for applying business concepts across various domains. For readers with more experience or specific knowledge in business, there might be some redundancy in foundational topics. However, the unique perspectives and insights each author brings can still offer value, enriching a reader's overall grasp of business principles and practices.
