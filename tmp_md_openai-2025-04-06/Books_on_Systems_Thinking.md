Books on systems thinking specifically tailored for software development blend the principles of systems theory with the practicalities of software engineering. Here are some recommendations:

1. **"Thinking in Systems: A Primer" by Donella H. Meadows** - While not exclusively about software, this book provides a foundational understanding of systems thinking, which can be applied to software development.

2. **"The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization" by Peter M. Senge** - This book emphasizes the concept of a learning organization, which is highly relevant to adaptive and evolving software development environments.

3. **"Software Systems Architecture: Working With Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives" by Nick Rozanski and EÃ³in Woods** - This book delves into software architecture but through a systems thinking lens, considering various stakeholders and perspectives.

4. **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides** - Known as the "Gang of Four" book, it's essential for understanding common software design patterns, a key part of systems thinking in software development.

5. **"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin** - While focusing on code quality, this book indirectly teaches systems thinking by emphasizing the impact of code structure on software systems.

6. **"The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas** - Offers a broad perspective on software development, touching on systems thinking in the context of practical software engineering.

7. **"Systemantics: How Systems Work and Especially How They Fail" by John Gall** - A classic text on systems in general, with insights applicable to understanding and managing software systems.

8. **"Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit" by Mary and Tom Poppendieck** - Adapts lean manufacturing principles to software development, offering a systems perspective on streamlining and efficiency.

Each of these books offers a unique perspective on systems thinking in the context of software development, providing both theoretical foundations and practical applications.
