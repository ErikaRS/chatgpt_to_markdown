The terms "Grits" and "Tories" have historical origins that date back to political developments in Canada and the United Kingdom.

### **Grits**
- The term "Grits" refers to members of the Liberal Party of Canada. The nickname dates back to the 19th century and is believed to originate from the Reform Party in Upper Canada (now Ontario), which was a precursor to the Liberal Party. The term "grit" was originally used to describe someone with a gritty or tenacious character, which the Reformers adopted to highlight their dedication to democratic principles and opposition to the conservative elites. Over time, "Grit" became a colloquial term for Liberal supporters.

### **Tories**
- The term "Tories" refers to members of the Conservative Party of Canada. This term has its origins in British political history, where the Tories were one of the two main political factions, alongside the Whigs. The Tories were associated with conservative, royalist, and traditionalist values. When the British North American colonies (which later became Canada) adopted the British parliamentary system, the term "Tory" was carried over to describe supporters of the conservative political factions in Canada, and it eventually became synonymous with members of the Conservative Party.

These nicknames have persisted over the years and are still commonly used in Canadian political discourse today.
