What is a hierarchical navigable small world map?

A Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) map is a type of data structure used in machine learning and artificial intelligence for fast approximate nearest neighbor search. It is based on the idea of creating a hierarchy of subgraphs, where each subgraph is a small world network. 

In an HNSW map, nodes represent data points, and edges represent the distances between them. The map is constructed in a hierarchical manner, where each level of the hierarchy contains a subset of nodes from the previous level. The nodes at each level are connected to a small number of nodes in the next level using shortcuts, which allow for faster traversal of the graph.

The term "navigable" refers to the fact that the graph is designed in such a way that it can be efficiently traversed to find the nearest neighbors of a given data point. This makes HNSW maps particularly useful in applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

Overall, an HNSW map provides a way to efficiently search for similar data points in high-dimensional spaces, which is a common problem in machine learning and AI.
