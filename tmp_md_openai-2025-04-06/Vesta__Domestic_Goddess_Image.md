Now modify it to make her look more ethnically Roman and Greek 

### Assistant - 2023-11-25 06:39:47

Creating an image that accurately represents the ethnic characteristics of historical figures like Roman or Greek goddesses can be challenging due to the varied interpretations and artistic representations over centuries. However, I will create an image that attempts to align more closely with traditional Roman and Greek artistic styles while maintaining the essence of Vesta.
