We are going to be writing a review of Get On Track by Paula Dieli. Start by describing my book review style as applied to technical non-fiction books

### Assistant - 2025-03-17 17:12:21

Your book review style for **technical non-fiction books** is structured, objective, and highly informative. It emphasizes clarity, depth, and a balanced perspective, ensuring that readers grasp the book's key insights while understanding its practical applications and limitations. Here’s how your approach applies to technical non-fiction:

1. **Objective and Informative**

   - Your reviews go beyond the surface to **explore the nuances** of the book’s approach.  
   - You highlight specific methodologies, frameworks, or case studies included in the book.  
   - If the book is **highly prescriptive**, you analyze whether its recommendations are **practical and broadly applicable**.

5. **Balanced Perspective**  
   - You acknowledge both the book’s **strengths and its limitations**.  
   - If the book presents a particular methodology, you discuss whether it is **universally applicable or context-dependent**.  
   - You consider potential **gaps or weaknesses**—for example, if the book lacks real-world examples or if its claims require additional validation.

6. **Reflective and Thought-Provoking**  
   - You conclude by reflecting on how the book’s concepts align with **your own philosophy** and industry trends.  
   - If relevant, you suggest who would benefit most from reading the book.  
   - You might also connect the book’s ideas to **other influential works** in the field.

## Review

## Reflections

- Did I learn? Did I acquire new information? Did I grow? Did the form of my understanding change?
    - Somewhat. Most of the information was fairly familiar, but the concise, usable format was valuable.
- Was it well written? Was it structured well, coherent, beautiful?
    - It was well written and well structured and coherent. Was it beautiful? No, but the subject matter doesn't exactly lend itself to that 
- Did I enjoy it? Do I look back upon it fondly?
    - Yes I did, and I do look back upon it fondly
- Other thoughts
    - I would probably rate this a 4/5 if what you're looking for is specifically a book on program management from a leadership perspective. It was well structured and practical and made it clear when and how to build an effective program management office. 

## Detailed contents & notes

Introduction

Part One: Building Your Program Management Office
- 1. What is Program Management?
    - What's the Difference between Program and Project Management?
    - When Should You Add Program Management?
    - Ask Questions First
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Program managers drive the design, development, and delivery of a program at the cross-functional level in service of the company vision. 
        - Add in program management when cross-functional coordination is a challenge and organizations aren't communicating well across functional boundaries. 
        - Focus on the top priority programs in the early stages of creating a PMO to demonstrate value and ensure success.
        - Socialize the PMO within the company early on so that people understand what program managers do and how they can help move the company toward its goals.
- 2. Laying Down the PMO Tracks
    - Should You Centralize Your PMO?
    - How Should You Fund Your PMO?
    - Building Diversity into Your PMO
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Structure the PMO to ensure maximum operational efficiency, which is so important in the early stages of a company's growth. 
        - Centralizing a PMO has advantages such as streamlining procedures and avoiding redundancy. 
        - Explore the various ways to fund the PMO, such as a model where the organization requesting a program manager funds the headcount but leaves the management of the program manager to the PMO. This can be combined with a centralized funding model to meet the needs of all types of organizations.
        - Train the PMO on the importance of diversity and inclusion, build it into the hiring process, and ensure the work environment is inclusive.
- 3. Branding the PMO
    - How to Brand the PMO
        - 1. Tell them who you are
        - 2. Explain what you do
        - 3. Demonstrate how people can engage with the PMO
        - 4. Here to help
    - What's in a (Program Manager's) Name?
    - The Value of Learning the Business
        - 1. Ask questions
        - 2. Take all training offered to employees
        - 3. Initiate whiteboard conversations
    - Get Invited to the Party
    - Developing a Taxonomy
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Branding what program managers do is critical, and socializing should start early in the game. Tell everyone about your team and the role.
        - Create a presentation that effectively communicates the PMO brand. Talk about what you don't do as well as what you do so that expectations are set correctly.
        - Assign all PMO leaders and individual contributors the task of socializing the brand.
        - Limit the use of the program manager title to people in the PMO or who are doing that role (in a company where the PMO is decentralized) to protect the brand thereby ensuring a clear understanding of the role.
        - Program managers can more effectively drive programs for the organization(s) they support when they have a solid understanding of the business.
        - Business leaders should invite program managers to the table whenever strategic discussions take place.
        - With a clearly defined and communicated taxonomy, your program management team and your external team members and stakeholders will use a common language around programs and program management.

- 4. All Aboard for Success
    - Setting Success Measures for a Program
    - Measuring the Impact of Program Management
        - 1. Positive feedback
        - 2. Effective risk mitigation
        - 3. Efficient communication
    - The Importance of Scheduling
    - How to Create a Program Schedule
    - Kicking Off a Program
        - Kickoff agenda
            - Welcome 
            - Program goals
            - Success measures
            - Review of schedule
            - Roles and responsibilities
            - Q&A
    - The Program Team Meeting
    - Effective Status Reporting
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Clarify how you will measure the success of the program to ensure the team's hard work won't be for nothing.
        - Measure the impact of program managers as well. Even though their work requires soft skills (p. 170) that may be harder to measure, they play a pivotal role in program success.
        - Schedules are vital. You wouldn't start a train trip without knowing where you're going and how long it's going to take. Because programs are strategic and cross-functional, make sure you have a good schedule in place and that everyone is aware of and aligned with the key milestones.
        - A program kickoff allows everyone to understand the program goals, get on board with the schedule, and confirm who's doing what. It also builds momentum and team spirit to carry you through those rough patches.
        - Status reporting is critical to keep stakeholders apprised of program progress. It also helps the program manager take stock of progress and focus on the right issues and risks.
- 5. Issues and Risks
    -  How to Manage Issues and Risks
        - 1. Classify risks early
        - 2. Resolve issues quickly
        - 3. Inform stakeholders continually
    - A Program without Risks Does Not Exist
    - Are You in the Loop?
    - Managing Teams Across Multiple Geographies
        - Understand the requirements
        - Build relationships
        - Don't skip the program kickoff
        - Run effective virtual meetings
        - Encourage team building outside of meetings
        - Gather the team together
        - Run a virtual summit
    - The Remote Life
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Every program has risks and they will change throughout the program. It's critical that program managers know what's going on at all times so they can proactively mitigate risks before they become issues.
        - The program manager should be laser focused on mitigating risks. If a risk becomes an issue, work with your program team to resolve it quickly to avoid schedule delays.
        - Program managers play a pivotal role in bringing together program teams that span multiple geographies. Use the suggested tips and techniques and a growing number of video conferencing and messaging tools to facilitate global communication and effective remote working environments.

Part Two: Running Your Program Management Office
- 6. Get to Know Your Crew
    - Clarify Roles and Responsibilities
    - Developing Effective Stakeholder Relationships
    - The Role of Executive Sponsor
    - Business Leads as Key Partners
    - Program Manager and Functional Project Manager
    - The Complementary Roles of Program Management and Operations
    - The Role of the Product Manager
    - Pair Program Management
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Program managers must ensure that all program team members understand their role and the decisions they're expected to make during the lifecycle of a program to keeps things running smoothly.
        - Regular contact between program managers and key stakeholders is critical to meeting stakeholder needs.
        - Executive sponsors are the visionaries and provide the strategic direction for a program. They are partnered with the program manager who can depend on them to interact with upper management as needed.
        - Program managers partner with the business lead/project manager/subject matter expert in each functional organization to ensure that workstream, which is a key part of the overall program, is successfully completed.
        - Programs are cross-functional and therefore complex by nature. Many different roles are required to get a program across the line.
            - Product managers understand customer requirements and work with the team to develop solutions to customer problems.
            - Operations managers ensure effective processes are in place.
            - Functional project managers are responsible for specific functional workstreams.
            - Program managers bring it all home with overall coordination.
        - Pair program management is a model in which a program lead responsible for a larger program or portfolio interacts with program managers across the various functions to make sure their dependent subprogram is successfully completed.
- 7. Check Your Signals
    - Running Effective Program Team Meetings
    - Are Status Meetings Useful?
    - The Dreaded Laptop in Meetings
        - 1. Do your best to make the meeting useful and productive
        - 2. Check yourself
        - 3. Do your best to ensure active participation
        - 4. Make sure you have the right people in the room
        - 5. Politely ask attendees at the start of the meeting to close their laptops
    - Running Retrospectives
    - Green, Yellow, Red
        - Green: On track
        - Yellow: At risk and mitigating
        - Red: blocked or not likely to get back on track without intervention
    - A Second Pair of Eyes
    - No Notes Please!
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Effective program meetings focus on upcoming milestones, open issues, increasing risks, and gathering alignment as the program moves forward.
        - The program manager should spend time with the team they support throughout the work week in order to gather status rather than doing it in a meeting.
        - Limit laptop use by meeting participants so that you don't have to repeat yourself because someone is not paying attention to the discussion.
        - Running retrospectives during a program allows program team members to course correct as needed. Retrospectives at the end of a program are a good way to make sure future programs run more effectively.
        - When you flag items green, yellow, or red in a status report, this allows team members, leadership, and stakeholders to know how a program is progressing and if expectations are set correctly.
        - Ask a PMO colleague to review your status report before it goes out to ensure it's clear, accurate, and doesn't single out a person or a team unfairly.
        - Avoid taking notes in a program meeting so you can focus instead on what's coming next in the program and what's being said (or not). Keep your eyes on the participants to ensure alignment.
- 8. When Signals Get Crossed
    - The Program Manager Mingle
    - Seeing Is Believing
    - Program Management as a Crutch
    - When the Train Has Left the Station
    - Just When You Think You Have a Plan
    - Taking a Spring Break
    - When to Walk Away
    - Getting Together to Move Forward
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Mingle with your team members and stakeholders to know what's really going on, so you can mitigate risks or learn about new ones and keep in touch with changing stakeholder requirements.
        - Some people don't know they need program management until they see it in action.
        - Avoid the trap of fixing everyone and everything just because you are asked and you can. Focus on strategic execution and leave projects to the business team with the subject matter expertise to ensure accountability.
        - Jumping into a program in progress is challenging because stopping work or backtracking is often met with resistance. But there's no sense in continuing down the same track if you're solving the wrong problem!
        - Change is constant. A program manager effectively manages that change with their program team and leadership to achieve company goals.
        - Sometimes taking a spring break during a long program is a good thing.
        - Know when to walk away, if someone doesn't want the help of a program manager or is uncooperative.
        - Getting the team together periodically in the same location builds collaboration and helps solve intractable problems.

        - Develop a robust onboarding curriculum to ensure your program management practice is top-notch and consistent across the business.
        - A dual job ladder provides upward mobility for program managers who have no interest in or aptitude for people management.
        - A program manager buddy assigned to a newly hired program manager offers them a safe place to ask basic questions and helps them integrate.
        - Learning is a constant. Consider presenting topics at your PMO all hands meeting and then add those topics to the onboarding if appropriate to keep it up to date.
        - Program managers like variety in their work. Help them look for opportunities outside of the teams they officially support so they can broaden their knowledge of the business or their community and apply their skills with greater impact.

- Category: #books

## Highlights
- To nerdy girls everywhere: smart is beautiful! ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=38))
- She’s effective because she just blends into meetings, becoming part of the team. She’s respectful about what’s going on but keeps bringing up questions and picking up dropped balls in a very nonintrusive fashion. The team was struggling with how to move forward on developing a very broad new set of services and she helped us break down the work into meaningful parts with a timeline that made sense. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=63))
- At its core, program management is all about strategic execution. A company has a vision for what it wants to become. That vision provides the foundation for a long-term strategy, and then a set of annual goals and desired outcomes to move that strategy forward. Program managers put in place programs to drive successfully to those outcomes ensuring that the work done by the teams they support is derived from those company goals ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=75))
- In contrast to project management, which is more vertically focused and more domain specific, program management is focused on broader strategic goals. Successful program management drives alignment between several organizations in one company—for example, engineering, product management, marketing, and sales—toward a common goal. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=79))
- The skills required for a program manager in any industry are generally the same. What varies is their subject matter expertise. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=89))
- When you have a room full of people each with their own motivations and differing views about how to approach a problem, it’s good to know what is motivating that product manager, or what the engineering lead is thinking, as I did. ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=93))
- I also knew that smart people don’t like to be told what to do; that influencing without authority is the way forward. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=95))
- An exceptional program manager needs a solid understanding of the business together with strong planning and scheduling skills and the abilities to break down complex processes into meaningful sections, effectively communicate program status, and successfully mitigate issues and risks. But it’s people skills that make all the difference in this role. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=104))
- But you must also remain objective throughout the lifecycle of a program by keeping its goal(s) in the forefront and leading the team to make the right decisions for the business. Over time, that objectivity builds trust, which comes in handy when you need to nudge people in the direction required for program success. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=108))
- I learned the value of taking a proactive approach by getting to know the team and the business, building relationships, learning what keeps them up at night so risks can be mitigated and programs stay on track, establishing trusted partnerships with stakeholders, all with the objective of moving the needle on company goals. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=112))
- Similarly, when a businessperson tells me they need a program manager, there are things I need to know to help them arrive at their destination on track. I need to know where the business is trying to go and how quickly. How will this program move the needle on the overall company strategy? Have commitments been made already? Is there a plan in place and who is involved? And what’s the driving factor behind the program? ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=146))
- Then we develop a plan that includes goals, timelines, resourcing, roles and responsibilities, and measures of success. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=150))
- In program management, formal communication takes place during cross-functional program team meetings (or program meetings for short): we align everyone on the next several milestones, make decisions to enable progress, communicate and discuss plans that have cross-functional ramifications (such as pricing or launch plans), and resolve any issues that may have cropped up. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=152))
- But informal communication is equally, if not more, important than formal communication. When you drop by someone’s desk, hang out near the team you support, have coffee with key program team members, or build relationships with stakeholders—these are the times when the program manager learns what’s really going on. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=156))
- Like a train conductor, a program manager is focused on cross-functional coordination. They bring in the various program team members at the right time. Some team members, such as those in engineering, might be along for the whole ride. But other teams, such as the legal department, may not need to get on the train until later, when marketing content needs their review. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=158))
- It’s important that the program manager can count on each program team member to do their job, but they won’t get into their business unless there’s an issue. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=161))
- They know who their stakeholders are, who they can count on to deliver, and who or what has been problematic in the past. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=168))
- Good, proactive program managers are always mitigating risk. They’re always thinking about what could go wrong and putting things in place to ensure they don’t. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=170))
- The people working on a program often have diverse opinions, and it’s the program managers who facilitate conversations without taking sides and drive everyone to the decision that ensures the program’s goals are being met. Objectivity builds trust. When there is trust, program team members or stakeholders will alert the program manager to a risk (ideally before it becomes an issue), knowing that the program manager will solve it objectively in the best interests of the program. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=173))
- Program managers typically use retrospectives at the end of a program but often also upon completion of key phases, or legs of the trip, so they can make improvements along the way. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=177))
- Program management drives the end-to-end design, development, and delivery of a program at a cross-functional level to achieve the broader strategic goals that support the company’s vision. Project management is vertically focused and more domain specific: deep rather than broad. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=184))
- Program management is the process of managing multiple related projects headed toward the same result. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=188))
- Program managers therefore drive alignment between several organizations in a company—such as engineering, security and compliance, product management, marketing, and sales—to reach a common goal. And a group of projects is called—you guessed it—a program. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=191))
- Unfortunately, the communication gap between organizations in a company (read: silos) is sometimes more like a chasm. Program managers are there to bridge those chasms. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=195))
- Often program management isn’t added into a company until it doesn’t fit in one room (or small building), or perhaps when the company begins to expand across several geographies, often due to an acquisition. That’s when communication between organizations in the company gets challenging and silos begin to form. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=200))
- Work that is specific to an organization and doesn’t require outside help is what we call a project (in contrast to a program), and teams generally can and should handle that work themselves. But when the work requires more than one organization within the company, that’s when things get complicated. Enter program management! ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=202))
- The reality is that each of the managers in the PMO could drive several large and a few small programs simultaneously. But we stayed focused on the top priorities to get some successes under our belt and prove the overall value of program management. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=210))
- As the Zendesk PMO team grew and took on more programs, it was important to go where we were welcome. A few people resisted getting us involved and so we stayed away from those situations until they were sure about us and our impact. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=212))
- To this day, my mantra remains the same: focus on the highest priority programs, and go where our participation is embraced. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=215))
- Employees need to know what the PMO is, what the program managers will do, and how the PMO will help move the company’s vision forward. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=218))
- When people are aware of your purpose and how you work, your kickoff meeting is likely to be more productive. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=224))
- First, why do you need program management involved? Is the effort cross-functional? Is the business suffering from a lack of communication between functions? Is there a big group of projects that are all part of a broader goal that should be driven as one program? ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=226))
- Ask the sponsor or business owner to figure out the why and get back to you before you continue. The why is foundational for all the other questions a program manager needs to ask. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=231))
- the what questions are next: What’s the problem to be solved? What are the goals/objectives and how do they support the company strategy? What information exists already? What are the component parts to the program (multiple projects or workstreams)? What’s the primary driver? What do we optimize for (scope, schedule, or resources)? ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=232))
- Next the program manager needs to know who will be involved: Is there an executive sponsor? Is there a business owner or product owner? Who are the key stakeholders? Who is already involved in the program? Who else needs to be involved? At what level are people involved? What are their roles and responsibilities? ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=237))
- Then how are we going to get this done? How will this program be resourced? What risks might impact the program? What are the dependencies? Are there competing priorities? How will we know if we are successful? ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=240))
- Next tackle the where questions: Where are the resources located? Where are the dependent teams located and how will that impact their ability to collaborate? ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=243))
- Finally the program manager will get to when this program will take place: Is there a schedule? Has anyone already committed any dates to management or customers? Are we making any scheduling assumptions? ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=245))
- One thing program managers are not afraid of is too much information! ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=249))
- Determine how to structure the PMO. Should it be centralized or not? Figure out how the PMO headcount will be funded. Make sure the company is diverse in its hiring procedures by collaborating with the human resources department and through team training. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=263))
- Our initial programs were a new product launch and a rethinking of our pricing and packaging strategy. These programs were by their nature cross-functional. We worked with the usual suspects in product development: product managers, engineering managers, and software engineers. But in both these cases, we were also working with people from marketing, IT, and customer support. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=275))
- Channeling my manager at the time, Adrian McDermott, who always put company needs first, I shrugged and smiled and asked what he needed help with. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=282))
- So this was how the centralized PMO came into being at Zendesk—organically. People saw the positive impact we were having, and they wanted more of it. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=294))
- As the PMO hired a few more program managers and gained exposure across the company, people liked walking into a program meeting knowing how it would be run. They liked easily locating the weekly status reports in their inbox, all written in the same format, using the same green/yellow/red status measurements (p. 134). There’s a certain comfort in consistent processes. It avoids redundancy, which was critical for the small yet fast-growing company Zendesk was at the time. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=296))
- At a start-up or smaller company, centralizing the PMO function in the early years is a great way to ensure the function is set up in such a way that the role is well defined and the PMO runs well, which is important in a high-growth company. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=317))
- After the PMO becomes well established, and the company has grown enough that it’s now divided into divisions or business units, it’s not unusual for services organizations such as a PMO to be split up too. The program managers will already know each other well, and they’ll be working in a consistent way. As long as they continue to communicate and share best practices, the goodness that was created in the early days will live on. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=319))
- As we received requests from organizations outside of product development, each organization was asked to provide the headcount. The benefit to this model is that the organization has skin in the game. It is active on the field of play, sharing in both the success of the program manager they are funding and the work being done by that program manager. The organization providing the headcount funding shares the responsibility. They determine the priorities for their organization, and the program manager drives forward those highest priority programs. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=327))
- The potential downside to this funding model is that the organization may decide to pull the funding if they don’t see the value in the program manager’s work, or if there is a higher priority need for that headcount elsewhere in their organization. That’s certainly their prerogative. I consider the PMO to be a service organization that serves at the pleasure of the head of the organization that funds one or more program managers. That’s why it’s important that the program manager meet and exceed the needs of the organization they support. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=338))
- The plus side to a general fund for program managers (assuming you get enough headcount) is that the PMO can decide which programs are assigned program managers and how much time they spend on each. This allows for the flexibility to move program managers around as business needs change. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=352))
- The most important thing is to put in place a funding model that works for your company, which supports the way the various organizations within the company are structured and funded. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=354))
- For example, a 2018 Forbes article written by Bonnie Marcus called “What Does It Take to Keep Women in Tech Companies?” shows that more diverse companies are more profitable and create more long-term value. To that end, when building out a new team, I highly recommend ensuring the team is diverse when it comes to ability, age, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status/class. Diversity leads to innovation, inclusiveness, creativity, better decision-making, productivity, and higher profits. Diversity and inclusion are critical if you want to avoid having a team of program managers who approach problems in the same way. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=358))
- A team of program managers with the same background is problematic for obvious reasons—they all think the same way and may miss unique solutions because they’re all coming at the problems with the same biases. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=377))
- The job description also invites all to apply with this inclusive statement: “That said, if your experience looks a little different from what we’ve identified and you think you can rock the role, we’d love to learn more about you.” ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=382))
- Diversity and inclusion go hand in hand when it comes to optimizing your talent. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=393))
- Inclusion means ensuring that everyone has a seat at the table. That everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinion, particularly if it diverges from the direction of the conversation. Leadership can reinforce this by encouraging everyone, especially the quieter voices, to speak up and by challenging the team to come up with ideas outside the prevailing opinion. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=394))
- Ensuring psychological safety means that everyone in the room feels comfortable participating and sharing even when they have a different opinion, idea, or approach. After all, there’s no point in hiring diverse candidates and then not getting the most out of them! ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=396))
- One outcome of this is that other organizational teams at Zendesk have been inspired to create their own “branding” presentation to help socialize their team’s purpose at the company. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=432))
- I can’t stress how fundamental it is that everyone at the company understands what program management is and what to expect when engaging with the program managers. Socialization lays the groundwork for ensuring program managers are invited to the right conversations and meetings where strategizing and planning takes place. Those conversations and meetings give program managers the context for why a specific program is important, explain the team’s goals, and reveal how the program will move the company forward. ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=433))
- I am careful to brand the purpose of program management—that it drives the end-to-end design, development, and delivery of a program at a cross-functional level. I also make sure program managers are doing the work they’re supposed to be doing and not getting distracted by tasks that take them away from the things only program managers can do. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=439))
- The first section of your deck should talk about where the PMO sits in the company. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=450))
- The bulk of your presentation should be focused on what program managers do. Start by describing the difference between program and project management, since that’s a common question ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=458))
- The next thing to include is a slide with key verbs that describe a program manager’s day-to-day work. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=464))
- Then the presentation should talk about strategic execution and how program management translates company strategy into a set of portfolios and/or programs to realize company goals. As a way to concretize all of this information, I like to include examples of recent programs from a variety of organizations ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=468))
- It’s important to ensure those in the organization you support understand how to engage with the PMO. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=473))
- A successful program requires a tight partnership between the program manager and the business lead as their roles are complementary ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=479))
- Finally, I walk through some more detailed organization charts so it’s clear who will be working with whom, and then close with a reminder that program management is there to help them (their organization), their teams, and the whole company to work better to successfully achieve the company vision. After all, that’s what the PMO is all about! ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=486))
- The role of program manager had to be clearly defined alongside the specific things we do. If the title was used for many different roles, that was not going to help. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=503))
- But at a less established company, it’s important to continuously socialize the work program managers do until it’s crystal clear that most people understand the role. This means meeting with the executives, leaders, and subject matter experts on a program team and taking them through your branding deck to explain the role. As people join the company, you’ll need to socialize the PMO with them as well. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=507))
- In your deck, you might also take the opportunity to define similar sounding roles such as project manager or product manager so the differences are clear. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=513))
- Program management is a discipline practiced by professionals who are highly skilled and well trained in the discipline that is strategic execution—objectively driving complex cross-functional programs forward in order to execute on the company strategy. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=522))
- As you socialize and brand the PMO within the company, you have a terrific opportunity to get to know more about the business and organizations you will support, and that’s important for your success. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=527))
- Every program manager needs a good understanding of the business from the perspective of the organization they support. For example, if you’re an engineering program manager at a software company, you understand how software is built, what the development lifecycle looks like, how testing is done, and how solutions are deployed. You have enough technical background to understand how the work and the teams are structured and what the usual challenges are (such as performance, scalability, and reliability). ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=532))
- A program manager needs to consider what’s best for the program rather than be swayed by the opinions of team members, particularly those with whom they have a strong working relationship. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=539))
- If a program manager knows a lot (read: too much) about software development, sometimes they find themselves intrigued by one solution over another. They might forget to focus on what’s right for the program when distracted by an elegant technical solution, even if it’s not the most appropriate from a time-to-market perspective. At this point, the program manager has lost objectivity—and ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=541))
- A similar thing happens when a program manager lacks experience in a certain organizational function; they’ll need to quickly learn about the business as they begin working with that team. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=544))
- First, I study on my own, reading whatever materials are available about the business and the work in flight. Often I then ask the business leads to walk me through their priorities and goals. I ask what the executive in charge of the organization is worried about and what their business leads are excited about. This is a great way to get up to speed enough to advise on next steps, or to help unblock a team and move a program forward. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=550))
- To that end, I recommend all program managers moonlight on other teams whenever possible and when appropriate. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=555))
- Program managers need to understand the business enough to have sufficient context to effectively do their job and understand what they are program managing. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=558))
- Find out how the work in the core business gets done. If you are in the software industry, ask to see the software development life cycle (SDLC). Ask the technical folks to explain how the product is built, what technologies are being used, what the product roadmap looks like, and what processes and methodologies are in use. If the organization is on the go-to-market side of the business, ask how the teams are set up, what roles exist, how they interact, how they price and sell the product or service, and how they ensure customer success. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=561))
- Whether this is product, sales, or technical training, program managers should take any training offered. This is an excellent way to grow a program manager’s knowledge about the business. To this end, business leads should consider offering the program manager whatever training the business puts their employees through. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=566))
- Once there’s a basic understanding of how things are set up and run, program managers should ask where the challenges and pitfalls are, what the risk areas are, and what keeps the business lead or executive sponsor of the program up at night. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=570))
- Once a program manager has clarity on the business, they can more effectively run a meeting to keep everyone aligned on the business objective(s). They know how important a particular issue is, as they will have already elaborated the program risks into a risk register and can more effectively mitigate those risks. They’ll be better able to pinpoint resource gaps as they know what work is in progress and what’s left to be done. With a solid understanding of the business, program managers are simply that much more effective. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=572))
- Okay, so let me get this straight. You spent several days discussing all the things that a strategic program manager needs to know to effectively drive forward a complex program, and only now you want to bring one in? If you read through the program meeting kickoff questions that I talk about in Chapter One (p. 18), you’ll know that an opportunity has been missed by not including the program manager in those early conversations. Now they will have to ask questions about the things the team already spent several days discussing without them. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=583))
- Program managers want to be a part of all those discussions. They want to be privy to the wrangling that got you to a decision about whether, when, and how to move forward. They may sit quietly and take it all in, but they do want a seat at the table. Trust me—you want that program manager in your meeting!

- Connecting the dots is another useful technique, and one that program managers are eminently qualified to do.

- For a PMO taxonomy, simply speaking, there are big programs, medium-sized ones, and small ones. The large programs are usually made up of one or more portfolios, each aligned to a business goal or requirement. Within the portfolios, there are several programs, and perhaps a smaller portfolio that also contains programs. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=633))
- For example, a program manager drives a program forward but a project manager or business subject matter expert is responsible for project success. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=643))
- A great way to solidify the reader’s understanding is to take a couple of typical programs and draw the taxonomy in the context of those programs. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=648))
- how we would know if the program was successful. ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=680))
- Since a cross-functional program meeting is the usual forum for discussing and agreeing on program success measures, the program manager can ask the business lead to come to the meeting prepared with a proposal so that the team has something to react to. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=684))
- One of the critical tasks of the program manager is to ensure that teams measure the right things. Success measures are how you know if you’ve met the strategic/business objectives for a program and could be evaluated by customer usage, customer migration, customer conversion, revenue, or customer churn, for example. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=689))
- Some companies tend to operate more effectively with fewer goals because they’re easier to remember and focus on. Whatever the goal-setting criteria, it’s best to use what the company culture prefers. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=694))
- Sometimes, teams choose success measures that don’t connect to the business objective. For example, success is defined as shipping a product or releasing a feature. These outcomes are certainly positive steps along the way to achieving a business objective, but they don’t tell you if the customer likes the feature or if the rate of customer adoption will lead to expected revenue goals. I would argue that knowing you’ve actually solved a problem for the customer is the true measure of success. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=695))
- The program manager has an opportunity early on in the program cycle (but even later if required) to influence the team to set the right success measures. Success may mean different things to the various functional team members, so the savvy program manager may need to level up the conversation to the strategic goals, to what the business is expecting after your program is complete, which may be weeks or months after you think you’re done. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=706))
- One way to measure your impact is through positive feedback. The people you support may say things like “She’s awesome!” or “Things just run better” or “I don’t know how we’d get anything done without him!” Although this feedback is great to hear, it is of limited value. What you need to know is what makes them say this. So, first say thank you, and then ask what it is exactly about what the program manager is doing that makes them respond so positively. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=716))
- If program management was scoring an eight or above out of ten and teams were happier than before we arrived on scene, then we were doing something right. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=725))
- Program managers spend a good part of their efforts on risk mitigation, which has a direct impact on whether or not a program succeeds. Risks that are starting to increase should be mitigated quickly by the program manager such that the program never has a red (blocked) status. When they see smoke, they jump on it so quickly that it never becomes a fire. ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=728))
- The associated measurement can look like this: In 90 percent of high-impact, high-likelihood risks for the program there was a documented mitigation plan underway within a week of the risk increasing. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=733))
- What to do? Jump all over that issue and close it down! Promptly gather the right people together and determine how to solve the problem. That effort can be measured like this: All high priority issues for the program were resolved within two weeks of occurring. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=737))
- If a program manager’s schedule slips, does that mean that they’re not doing a good job? Well, if they’ve done a great job mitigating risk and quickly closing down issues, that gets the program most of the way there. If the reason the program schedule has slipped is due to an unforeseen competitive strike or a worldwide pandemic (for example), then it is harder to make that case. ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=740))
- A big part of a program manager’s job is continuous communication with stakeholders to ensure their needs are being met by the program. Happy stakeholders will tell you that their program manager stays in regular contact to update them on changes so there are no surprises during the lifecycle of the program. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=746))
- The goal might look like this: When surveyed, 100 percent of stakeholders said the needs for their programs were being met by their program manager. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=749))
- Sometimes scheduling is the hardest task for a program manager when setting up a program because the team might be reluctant to provide dates. They may not yet know enough to provide dates they can stand behind. Or they’re wary of committing and then not being able to follow through. It’s also not easy to estimate work that has vague requirements, especially if you’re at a high-growth company whose work is innovative. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=761))
- Arriving at milestones and dates for brand-new work can be challenging. The work needs to be broken down into the smallest chunks possible, at least down to weeks and often down to days. This is much easier to approximate when the discovery and design phases are complete, but the reality is that estimates often need to be provided well beforehand. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=764))
- They may encounter resistance when pushing teams to provide that level of detail and commit to it, but it has to be done. I had one engineering manager say with exasperation, “Why are you so focused on dates?” It isn’t about the dates—it’s about having the ability to tell if the program is on track. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=768))
- Now if that same engineering manager provides me with their best estimates based on known information, past experience on similar efforts, plus advice from key team members, my ability to track progress is much improved. At least I have an idea of what’s expected, can explain to management that the schedule is tentative, and then adjust the schedule and related status as needed, keeping everyone in the loop at all times. It’s not perfect, but it’s better than nothing and it’s often the reality of developing software! ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=772))
- But if a program manager has as much notice as possible so that they can communicate changes to the stakeholders, it is definitely workable. With enough notice, people can adjust their plans. They won’t love it, but they’ll understand. As engineering VP Bill Finch from Hewlett-Packard used to say to me, “I don’t like being disappointed, but I really hate being surprised!” ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=779))
- Enough time should be given to the team to create a schedule they can stand behind, even if it’s not exact. The program manager can negotiate with management for some give and take as needed. The engineering manager should understand that the program manager has their back and will mitigate continually to ensure the team has the best shot at meeting their milestones. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=785))
- A program manager can also help the reluctant manager arrive at a draft schedule by asking how long each task will take: a day, a week, or a month. A month? Oh no, it won’t take that long! A few days? It’s more complicated than that—two weeks is a good estimate. Now we’re getting somewhere! This approach is painstaking, but after a couple of practice rounds usually the manager will go away and work on a schedule and come back to the program manager with something they can use as a foundation. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=790))
- A program has clear start and end dates, and the schedule is used to guide the program manager through its lifecycle. The main stages of a program schedule usually are: Discovery Implementation Validation Launch Retrospective ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=799))
- The program schedule only includes cross-functional milestones and is generally less detailed than each functional project schedule. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=804))
- The program schedule is kept up to date by the program manager on an ongoing basis and is usually updated before the status report is written (p. 78). The updates are gathered continuously as the program manager meets with the various stakeholders throughout the work week. ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=805))
- Any items that are at risk or delayed/blocked should be discussed with the owner, and any issues that require cross-functional team members should be discussed at the weekly program meeting. The types of issues surfaced will be related to changes in scope, schedule, or resources, in other words those that can’t be resolved with just one or two program team members. The business lead, executive sponsor, and stakeholders should be alerted by the program manager when there is any hint of a change in the schedule that will cause a delay. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=809))
- Once the program schedule is in place, the program manager should gather together the team members from each function for a kickoff meeting, which will be the first in a series of weekly cross-functional program team meetings. ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=815))
- The business lead will present the program goals and success measures since they’re the subject matter expert and the one setting the program requirements. The program manager will go through the schedule and roles and responsibilities, and then any questions should be addressed. By the time this kickoff meeting is over, everyone should leave the meeting inspired and excited about the journey ahead. ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=821))
- Review progress and plan what’s required to keep moving forward on a timely basis. Review risks that may be increasing and what is being done to mitigate them. Review issues that may have surfaced and proposed solutions. Decisions will be made here so that progress continues. Remind the team what needs to be done to reach the next couple of milestones on schedule and assign future agenda items accordingly. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=827))
- Example topics include clarification of program goals, review of and alignment on requirements and plans, and discussion of issues and risks. Dependencies should be reviewed to check that the team has what they need from others outside of the program team. Note that these topics require the active participation of the attendees, so the program manager should ensure the right people will be in the room. If a team member can’t attend, they should send an appropriate replacement so that their absence doesn’t negatively impact program progress. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=832))
- Like train conductors who announce upcoming stations, all program managers in a company should have a consistent way of status reporting to make it easy for stakeholders know what to expect. This key task is a good opportunity for program managers to stop at the end of each week and reflect on where things are and pivot as needed. Think about what needs to be communicated and which risks or issues should be the focus of the next week. Bottom line, status reporting is the best way of communicating program updates at regular intervals to program stakeholders. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=841))
- Usually status reports consist of upcoming milestones, changes to plan (scope, schedule, or resources), issues, risks, program manager name (in case a stakeholder has additional questions), and the status color—typically green, yellow, or red ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=847))
- The biggest value of status reporting is that it allows a program manager to step back at the end of the week (or two weeks or month for programs that don’t change very often) to evaluate how things are progressing. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=851))
- Reassessing program status may mean a quick physical or virtual walk around to see your program team members and chat about how things are going to catch any changes to plan or any new issues or risks. ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=861))
- The status report is the program manager’s objective view of how the program is progressing and must be fair and accurate to give the stakeholders an unbiased view. A yellow or red status isn’t bad; it’s simply a reflection of the innovative nature of the work being done and the dynamic context in which the company is operating. Yellow or red should always be accompanied by an explanation as to what’s being done to get the program back to green. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=864))
- As a program management leader, I use status reports not only as a way to understand the status of the many programs the PMO has going at one time, but also to determine if the program manager is on top of things. If I click from the status report to the more detailed plan and it’s not up to date, or the risk register appears light or empty, I’ll start asking questions. If I see typos in the report, that reveals a lack of attention to detail, and I’ll dig for more information. Although some program managers think I obsess a bit about status reports, they are a reflection of how effectively the program is being managed. And that’s something about which I really do obsess! ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=867))
- Good program managers know that where there’s smoke, there’s fire. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=883))
- A risk is an uncertain event that would have a negative impact on the program if it occurs. Risks should be mitigated by a program manager so that they don’t occur. If a risk does occur, it is now an issue to be dealt with and closed in order to get the program back on track. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=889))
- Mitigating risks and closing issues are two pivotal activities for program managers. ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=892))
- Risks should be thought about in the early stages of a program, in the context of what you could call a pre-mortem. The program manager involves the team in an exercise where they imagine the program has failed. Then they work backward to determine what could lead to that program failing, and how to keep that from happening. This is an effective way to get the team to own some of the responsibility throughout the life of the program for a positive result. ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=892))
- If risk mitigation is tackled early on, there are usually fewer issues to deal with during the lifecycle of a program. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=895))
- But risk mitigation involves a lot of advance planning and imagining the worst that can happen. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=896))
- Part of the planning process includes creating a risk register—a list of risks that could potentially hamper progress. A program manager classifies these risks into those that are least and most likely to occur, and whether they would have low, medium, or high impact. Examples of common risks include scope creep, dependency on a shared resource, or poor communication causing confusion or lack of clarity. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=901))
- They start with the things most likely to occur that carry the highest impact. They constantly work to mitigate those risks until the program is successfully completed. They ask what they, their team members, and any dependent teams might do to keep these risks from occurring. And when they smell smoke, they are all over it! Stamp out that smoke before it becomes a fire because if you are unable to do that, now you have an issue. ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=906))
- Once a risk becomes an issue, a program manager should be all over it until it’s dealt with. Drop less important work, mobilize resources, quickly determine proposed fixes, and drive the team to a solution in a timely manner. Escalate the issue to the management level only if needed. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=910))
- Ideally, if you’re obsessively focused on risk mitigation, issues should rarely occur. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=914))
- Program managers should involve stakeholders in the creation of the risk register so that their interests are represented. They should inform the stakeholders continually (usually via written updates) of the status of potential risks and how they would impact them and their team(s). ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=918))
- If a stakeholder doesn’t hear from the program manager, they should reach out, especially if they see something worrisome in the status report. But this approach is only a backup plan as program managers should be proactive when it comes to keeping their stakeholders informed and involving them as needed in a mitigation. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=922))
- A Program without Risks Does Not Exist ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=924))
- One of my favorite activities on a Sunday afternoon was to read through the many status reports my Zendesk program managers sent out on a weekly basis. Okay, fine. I need a life! Seriously though, doing this as a PMO leader provides a good overall understanding of how the team is driving company strategy forward. I spend less time on the status of programs that are flagged green and on track, dig into those that are yellow, and definitely read up on programs that are glowing red. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=925))
- A good way to ruin my Sunday is for a status report to have an empty risk register. “How is that possible?” you might ask. Well, that’s a good question. Every program has risks because there’s always a chance that something will adversely impact its scope, schedule, or resources. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=933))
- A good program manager should have a handle on the list of things that could possibly go wrong and have thought through the likelihood and impact of each occurrence. These risks should be noted and reviewed by the program manager on a weekly basis, for example, when they’re writing the status report. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=936))
- If a risk register is empty, the program manager probably hasn’t spent time thinking through the risks, and it’s unlikely they’re doing any risk mitigation, or they’re not mitigating the right thing(s). If a risk register is out of date or light on detail, you should question whether the program manager has a good handle on things. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=940))
- Good program managers spend time thinking about what could possibly go wrong and how to prevent it. This isn’t because they are all doom and gloom, but because they live in the real world where the only constant is change. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=943))
- Every program has risks, but the savvy program manager is always mitigating them until the program is successfully completed. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=946))
- Program managers get a gold star at the end of a smooth-running program, one where I never had to hear about a red status. If a program manager never needs to put out a fire, then they’re a hero. And they do this by identifying their program’s risks early in its lifecycle and then mitigating the heck out of them! ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=949))
- Good program managers already know when things have started to go south because they have established healthy relationships with their team members and are informed about any deviation to the plan. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=953))
- I can hear my mother saying, “Mind your own business!” But in this case, their business is my business! (Sorry, Mom!) If I learn about a problem when it’s too late, the schedule will have already slipped, and I won’t be able to help the team recoup the lost time. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=959))
- Besides the all-important informal information gathering that goes on, the rest of what a program manager learns about program status comes from a regular cadence of cross-functional program team meetings, where the team is reviewing requirements, marketing messaging, end-to-end testing, and strategy proposals. If an issue has surfaced, the program team members show up prepared to discuss the issue at hand and work as a team to brainstorm ideas, put proposals on the table, and work toward a solution. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=961))
- A program that involves teams from around the world holds an inherent risk. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=968))
- This kind of misalignment, along with a lack of communication, can develop quickly when people located in different buildings or geographies must work collaboratively. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=971))
- Miscommunication and misalignment pop up even when everyone has been informed and is working from the same schedule, so the savvy program manager must always be watching for this. When it occurs, program managers play a pivotal role in gathering together teams that span multiple geographies. This involves meeting with program team members at all hours of the day and night to clarify program requirements, reconfirm stakeholder expectations, review and or revise the program plan, or continue to build relationships—yes, often across thousands of miles. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=973))
- Traveling to meet in person is still the best way for a program manager to understand remote team members’ requirements and to ensure these are in line with stakeholder expectations. If that’s not possible, then an introductory video-conference meeting with key program team members will get this process started. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=978))
- You’ll need several follow-ups with various team members and stakeholders to review what’s been communicated, documented, and understood. Periodic check-ins between the program manager, business lead, remote team members and key stakeholder(s) are par for the course to keep things on track. ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=980))
- But these days it’s so often not the case, and there are several ways to establish these critical relationships regardless of location. One way is through a 1:1 meeting, and I’m a fan of having the program manager go to the other person rather than making them come to you. The PMO is a services organization, and you going to them sends a message that you’re there to help them. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=986))
- If the person in question is across the world, and it’s someone with whom you’ll be working for a while, meeting them in person, ideally toward the beginning of the program, is best, but should circumstances prevent this, a video call is the next best thing. From there, regular check-ins across the miles are critical to program success. ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=991))
- Whenever possible, you should get program team members and key stakeholders in the same “room” for a program kickoff to do the following: Clarify program goals Align on success measures Review roles and responsibilities Inspire and motivate the team ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=998))
- it’s important to note that the alignment problem outlined at the start of this section can be avoided if the program manager covers key decisions such as design, architecture, pricing, and launch details at the kickoff. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1008))
- Adding a Slack channel for ongoing communication throughout the day is a great complement to meetings as it means questions get answered more quickly as team members in one time zone can ask questions that get answered as they sleep. And team building happens all day every day as people drop in and out as desired. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1015))
- If teams are struggling to make progress across geos, it might be time to consider busting the budget and getting everyone together in one geographic location, even just for a week (p. 160). If this isn’t possible, consider a long virtual meeting with people in the same virtual room for a few hours. Just leaving the line open, so to speak, while people are working away facilitates conversation. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1018))
- The important thing is that time together, whatever that looks like, promotes conversation and results in effective problem-solving that might save hours, days, or even weeks when all is said and done. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1023))
- For long-running programs, consider a virtual summit held at, for example, the midpoint of the program, where the executive sponsor or business lead reminds everyone of the program goals, and the various teams demo their work in progress. This can be fun and motivating and may surface any areas where teams are misaligned. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1025))
- Although remote employees can provide significant benefits for business growth and productivity, the challenge is in building relationships between people who work together but rarely or never meet face-to-face. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1033))
- best practices for building relationships remotely. Meet face-to-face at least once if possible. It makes all the difference. Get your good mood on! Since your time together is limited, make the most of it. No one looks forward to meeting with a gloomy person who spends most of the meeting complaining or venting. ... Be present. There’s nothing worse than distractions such as devices, the doorbell, pets ... Remember we are all human. Sometimes we forget the personal side of our colleagues. Whether you are sending flowers or a note of thanks, or simply saying thanks in a virtual meeting, when you genuinely acknowledge moments of job success, or ask about a sick child, the gesture is as much if not more appreciated by a remote team member than an in-person one. ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1035))
- As I set up a program management framework, I was careful to explain how program managers did our jobs, so that teams wouldn’t worry that we were going to encroach on their territory and get into their business. Most employees didn’t understand that our role was about helping them achieve their broader goals. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1058))
- This guaranteed that a team member couldn’t go to one sponsor, not like the answer, and then go to the other to see if they could get an answer they liked better—something that could have resulted in undesirable antics and confusion. Samanda held to their word and on several occasions when a decision was time sensitive, we saved time because we could go to whoever was available to get a quick decision. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1075))
- I recommend you use the most appropriate RACI matrix for your program and make sure it’s clearly communicated early on in the program lifecycle, ideally at the kickoff. With everyone aligned, you won’t lose valuable time later figuring out who is responsible for a particular decision and then hunting them down to see if they agree. This way you can avoid adding risk to the program, have key decisions made on time, and keep to the timeline. ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1080))
- The stakeholder is a person or group of people who have a stake in the program outcome. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1091))
- Get to know the people counting on the success of the program to achieve their goals. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1097))
- If and when things that impact a stakeholder change, reach out to them to discuss the details before they read about them in the status report. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1101))
- Bear in mind that not all stakeholders are equal. Some are more important to the program than others. Some care more about the results than others. You will spend more time with those who are more impacted. ([Location 1103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1103))
- Are they clear on the progress (especially when the deliverable or timeline has changed)? What has them worried? This last question can be a trigger for something that may require risk mitigation by the program manager. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1105))
- For more important stakeholders, this update should be timelier than waiting several days for a weekly status report. Sending a direct message or having a quick check-in meeting, virtual or otherwise, will get them up to speed right away. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1108))
- Regular contact with stakeholders is critical. A program manager needs to circulate and mingle with program team members, in person or virtually, so that they are aware of absolutely everything that’s going on with a program, can jump on things as needed (p. 143), and can update stakeholders in a timely manner. ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1112))
- You’ll know who they are as they hang around making sure things get off to a good start and are present until successful program completion. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1119))
- The executive sponsor is the visionary providing the strategic direction. They sell the idea to upper management and to others around the company and create the presentation that describes the program goals. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1120))
- If there’s a key change to the program, they update executive leadership and get any needed approvals, and they (along with the program manager) keep key executive level stakeholders informed, preferably before the program status comes out, so that there are no surprises. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1122))
- The executive sponsor makes all key decisions, so if there’s a proposed change to scope, schedule, or resources, they are who you talk to for approval. They are a close partner with the program manager and will attend your weekly program meetings and have weekly 1:1 meetings with you as well. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1124))
- Ideally a program will have one single executive sponsor, one “throat to choke” as the saying goes. I have run programs with cosponsors, and if they communicate well and are closely aligned, this can work too. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1127))
- But what happens if there’s no executive sponsor? First, this should sound an alarm bell. A program can’t go forward without an executive sponsor who has been assigned responsibility for the effort. You should reach out to leadership to ask where the requirement for this program came from. What’s the strategic level goal this program is related to? If there’s no answer, then it’s unlikely this work should be prioritized. ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1129))
- If you have to, pause the work and let your manager and the leader of the organization you support know that you can’t continue until you have an executive partner—or until you determine that the program isn’t strategically important and should be set aside. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1132))
- Program managers drive programs forward, but they do that at the request of an executive who understands the business need and is motivated to see that the work gets done. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1134))
- Business leads are the subject matter experts in the organization the program manager is supporting. They are required for the program to move forward. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1141))
- The best business leads are those who see program managers as team members and support them as they drive their programs forward. This is because both the program managers and business leads are working on behalf of the stakeholder who is expecting that their product or service is successfully delivered. ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1145))
- The business leads work alongside program managers to keep the program team members executing on the right priorities, answer any business-related questions that crop up, make decisions that resolve an open issue, and offer solutions for effective risk mitigation. ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1148))
- The program manager should know enough to be able to understand the gist of what the business lead is talking about, what’s important, and when a decision needs to be made by that business lead. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1152))
- Now the program manager is thrust into the role of having to defend the team member rather than remaining objective. The business lead is no longer accountable, which means the program manager has become a crutch ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1156))
- Program managers should make sure they know enough about the business to be effective, but they aren’t and shouldn’t be the business lead at the same time. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1159))
- Program management is the process of managing multiple related projects working toward the same business objective. A program is made up of several, sometimes many, smaller projects. For example, a program to release a new software product requires several engineering projects, an IT project for customer invoicing, a marketing project for launch content, and a sales project to train salespeople in how to sell the product. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1167))
- Projects are domain specific and organization specific. Project managers have domain specific knowledge and deep expertise. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1170))
- Although project managers possess organizational skill sets similar to program managers, generally they are subject matter experts with deep expertise in a particular area. They often don’t have the title of project manager, but you know them when you see them. Often they’ll hold function-specific titles such as engineering lead, IT manager, accounting lead, or marketing campaign manager. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1173))
- Programs are strategic and cross-functional. A program manager takes a much broader, more strategic view of the program. They depend on the functional project managers to drive and complete workstreams that ladder up to a broader program. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1177))
- Functional project managers drive project work to completion. They communicate start and end dates and any issues to the program manager and tend to be task-based and immersed in the granular details of a workstream. They assess cost, effort, and resourcing. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1179))
- Program managers specialize in understanding just enough about all the workstreams to know how they fit together. They are also skilled in breaking down big problems into smaller chunks and helping teams determine how to get all those chunks working together at the right time. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1181))
- Rest assured we don’t get into the project manager’s business, unless they miss a deadline or a train stop along the way! ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1184))
- The operations team is responsible for the ongoing people, processes, and systems that keep an organization running smoothly. So, in the context of program management, the operations team is called upon when an existing process needs to be modified to work better or a new process needs to be developed in service of a program. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1187))
- Another common example is planning—long-range, annual, or quarterly. Whether doing planning at the corporate or the organizational level, operations and program management partner closely on this process. Operations owns defining and refining the planning process and often relies on program management to execute that process from end to end. ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1203))
- Planning is a business-critical company activity, and operations and program management should work in concert to ensure this effort is productive. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1210))
- Since the company was still small at the time, it wasn’t uncommon for employees to do double duty. At that time, the product managers performed some tasks that a program manager usually handles, like setting up a program plan/schedule or driving a product launch forward. This situation is fairly common in smaller companies not yet staffed with program managers. ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1218))
- Product managers represent the customer to the design and engineering teams. They are in regular contact with customers and understand current and future needs. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1221))
- They partner closely with a program manager who drives forward the work that needs to be completed for the customer to be satisfied. ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1226))
    - Note: they being product managers
- program managers took on the role of the objective person in the room, facilitating the sometimes heated conversations between product, engineering, and design by keeping everyone focused on the best solution for the customer. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1231))
- Program managers in product development at any software company spend a lot of time with the product managers to learn what they want to accomplish on behalf of the company’s customers. ([Location 1232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1232))
- in start-ups and smaller companies, in the absence of program management, often the product manager or technical lead may take on some of the program planning and status reporting. Although it’s not ideal—doing it well requires their time and the right skill set—it can be done. What’s missing is the objectivity that a program manager brings to the table, and the ability to focus full time on ensuring that the work of all the program team members will result in a successful program. ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1237))
- Additionally, cross-functional coordination will become paramount, particularly as a company grows, and will require the full-time attention that a program manager brings to the table. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1241))
- Although we had divided up the work between us, it was important to have a single point of contact (POC) for program team members to reach out to for any questions or issues. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1248))
- Since there is a certain amount of shared knowledge, this means that one of the pair program managers can adequately substitute for the POC program manager in case of illness or vacation. ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1260))
- Programs are cross-functional and therefore complex by nature. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1272))
- Product managers understand customer requirements and work with the team to develop solutions to customer problems. Operations managers ensure effective processes are in place. Functional project managers are responsible for specific functional workstreams. Program managers bring it all home with overall coordination. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1273))
- Pair program management is a model in which a program lead responsible for a larger program or portfolio interacts with program managers across the various functions to make sure their dependent subprogram is successfully completed. ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1276))
- Well-run cross-functional program meetings with retrospectives at key milestones are useful checkpoints. Effective status reporting is also important as it signals to program team members and key stakeholders how a program is progressing, as well as what’s being done about any issues or increasing risks to ensure it stays on track. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1282))
- Well-run meetings are a thing of beauty. ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1285))
- the outlook he left behind was that program managers have a responsibility to move things forward and respect the team’s valuable time in the process. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1303))
- Discuss in person what can’t be done (effectively) over email or direct message. Review the plan and what’s required by whom to get to the next milestone. Walk through content, such as launch or performance testing plans, to get feedback. Bring up identified gaps or omissions and surface where alignment is needed before proceeding with the program. Work through issues that have surfaced and drive them to a resolution. Hold pre-mortems to pinpoint tasks that can be done to make sure certain problems don’t happen. Hold retrospectives at the end of a program and at key milestones throughout. Input for that retrospective should be gathered before the meeting, so the meeting is a group discussion about what to start and stop, and what to do better. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1305))
- One thing we definitely don’t do is to go around the table and report status. This is not a status meeting—that can be done faster and more effectively over email or direct messaging. ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1312))
- Program managers are often asked, “How are things going?” They should be able to answer that question at any moment in time with an executive summary: ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1319))
- The program manager gathers and communicates status on an ongoing basis, throughout the lifecycle of a program. Program status is best gathered by a program manager who is always checking in with team members at their (virtual) desk, over lunch or coffee, wherever team members congregate, in a 1:1 video meeting, over email, or through a direct message application such as Slack. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1322))
- Meeting regularly with key stakeholders—to make sure they are happy with the program progress, update them on any changes or increasing risks, and ensure their needs haven’t changed—is another way to stay in the loop. If something has changed, you will be on it. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1325))
- Usually once a week, the program manager reports on the program status via an email update. Creating this report shouldn’t take a lot of time if the program manager is up to date on what’s going on. ([Location 1328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1328))
- Program managers who do not manage their time well, or do not check in regularly with team members, may be tempted to take the easy way out and just pull everyone together in a room to gather status. That’s a huge waste of other people’s time. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1332))
- Those people should be using their time together in a much more valuable way: discussing what’s coming up next in the schedule, how an open issue will be resolved, or how an increasing risk will be mitigated. Next steps are assigned, and the team then gets back to work. Now you’re talking! ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1334))
- Is the attendance of everyone required in order for the meeting to be productive? Do you need to discuss and solve an issue that is much more easily done with everyone in the room? Is a team member sharing information (new user workflow, launch plan, pricing details, etc.) that needs discussion and input? Is there a proposal on the table that will require lively discussion, alignment, and eventually a decision? ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1346))
- This is a useful meeting where group discussion is not optional. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1353))
- You facilitate so well that you draw people into the discussion, and they are motivated to close their laptop and chime in. You know who needs to weigh in and you make sure they do. ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1354))
- They were there “so they didn’t miss anything,” but that wasn’t a good use of their time. I encouraged her to cancel the meeting and start over, ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1361))
- She also added the people who were no longer included in the meeting to the status report distribution list. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1363))
- Issues were surfaced, discussions were held, decisions were made, and next steps were assigned. ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1369))
- Post-mortems, known as retrospectives in today’s agile world, are an important activity for program managers to run not only at the end of a program but also after key milestones. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1377))
- The whole point of a retrospective is to review three things: What went well What didn’t go well What actions could improve the process going forward ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1379))
- Increasingly, they started a program with a pre-mortem exercise where the program team imagines that the program has failed and then works backward to determine what potentially could cause it to fail, reviews each threat, and takes preventive actions. ([Location 1384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1384))
- For longer or more complex programs, program managers work with their executive sponsor and/or business leads to insert retrospectives at key points in the program. Improvements are made along the way, which saves time and allows the program team members to adjust plans and/or process to what’s going on, even if it only matters the next time around. ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1386))
- In a block of time at the end of the meeting, the program manager leads everyone through key points, or potential changes in the way the program team functions, that are up for discussion. ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1394))
- No one wants to repeat the same mistakes. In today’s dynamic world, where it’s almost expected that the best laid plans will change, retrospectives are a great tool for program managers to ensure the program will indeed meet its goals, especially if they’re changing as you go. ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1398))
- Status reporting is key to keeping program stakeholders in the loop, and it allows them to react to changes in a timely manner. Formal communication is typically done via status reporting. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1401))
- So how does the magic happen? At the end of each week, a program manager steps back and reviews the overall program goals and metrics, checks in on progress to plan, reviews open issues and increasing risks, and determines if a program is: GREEN: on track YELLOW: at risk and mitigating RED: blocked or not likely to get back on track without intervention ([Location 1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1403))
- Sometimes team members may view a yellow or red status as a bad mark, a sign to leadership that they are not doing their jobs. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Sh*t happens! Even with carefully laid plans, a wrench can get thrown into a program. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1408))
- I suggest using a data-driven approach wherever possible, but the program manager should also work in their assessment of the overall health of the program. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1412))
- Whether status is calculated automatically or by hand, the purpose of these status colors is to convey to key stakeholders how things are progressing so that expectations are correctly set. ([Location 1416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1416))
- A best practice for a program manager is to alert a program team member whose team is responsible for a status change (whether the status is changing from green to yellow or yellow to red) that the status is about to be sent out. This gives the team member time to alert their functional leadership about the status change and the details surrounding it. ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1418))
- It’s also important to word the change in status in a way that is fact based and avoids finger pointing. The reason for the delay is clear and, more importantly, the work in progress to get the status back to green is included. ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1420))
- Teams shouldn’t be afraid to have their program manager report on a yellow or red status as the program progresses. Stakeholders, and leadership, understand that there will be ups and downs and that things won’t always be flagged green. As long as the team is mitigating, a yellow or red status is not a black eye. The exception to this is if the same mistake is repeated. Then get ready for questions. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1425))
- Accurate status reports are to be celebrated rather than feared. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1432))
- Status reports may take several hours for a program manager to write because they are time-consuming and tricky. The program manager must step back and reflect on how things are going, compare progress to plan, and check in with team members or dependent teams to confirm details as often as necessary. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1433))
- I recommend that all program managers have a program management colleague review their status report prior to emailing it to a broad audience. The reviewer should use an agreed upon checklist and general guidelines as they verify that the status color is accurate, milestones are updated, and explanations are clear. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1438))
- This kind of course correction prevents the program manager from spending days or weeks repairing a relationship with someone whose work situation was misrepresented. ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1444))
- A shorter status report is usually a good thing if you’re trying to get people to read it and internalize it. ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1446))
- Status reports are often the only examples stakeholders see of a program manager’s work so it’s important that you make a good impression. You and your readers will be glad you did. ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1452))
- So, although I encourage documenting decisions and noting next steps, along with who’s assigned to each, that’s about it for the notes a program manager needs from a meeting. As I mentioned earlier, it’s best for someone else to be writing down these notes because note taking gets in the way of the program manager’s actual job. ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1456))
- Write things down if it works for you. But the program manager should never think it’s their job to note down everything that’s being said in a meeting they are facilitating. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1464))
- Instead I encourage you to focus on what matters: making sure the meeting objectives are met in order to drive the program forward, and noticing if an issue is surfacing or a risk is increasing so you can determine a mitigation plan. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1466))
- And please never take notes for someone else’s meeting! ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1467))
- If you are facilitating and someone asks who’s writing things down, gently suggest that if they feel notes are important, they might consider taking on the task. ([Location 1470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1470))
- He liked to open a shared document at the start of the meeting that contained the agenda. When a next step was agreed upon, or a decision was made, he would ask the person involved to please type that into the shared doc. ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1473))
- framework for program managers that ensures success: Meet (in person or virtually) with team members to work through issues in a timely manner and check in to find out how the program is progressing. Connect with dependent teams to ensure their work is going to plan and will be delivered on time. Sync with stakeholders to confirm the program is meeting their needs. Work with program team members to drive open issues to resolution. Mitigate risks that are increasing or uncover new ones you need to keep an eye on. ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1497))
- None of this requires that a program manager be hunkered down at their desk. They are not writing code, a product plan, or a requirements document that requires quiet, focused time away from others. They may periodically update a program plan or a risk register but that should take a few minutes, although writing a status report can take a couple of hours once a week. ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1503))
- If you are running a program, you need to be spending a generous amount of time with your program team, in person or virtually. ([Location 1505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1505))
- But if a program manager is spending an inordinate amount of time on their own, this sends the wrong signal to me and to their team members. If the program manager isn’t making an effort to spend time with the organization they support, that speaks volumes. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1512))
- Why aren’t they visible to their team? Why aren’t they making themselves available in case an issue is bubbling up? ([Location 1515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1515))
- But one lesson that continues to resonate is that occasionally people don’t know they need program management until they see it in action. ([Location 1526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1526))
- Talented program managers who are highly skilled at the discipline make their job look easy. Showing what we do is often more effective than talking about it. ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1543))
- How do you avoid the trap of fixing (or trying to fix) everyone and everything simply because you are asked and because you can? Well, the best way I know is to concentrate on the tasks that a program manager does best and which no one else can do. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1545))
- But the subject matter expert can do this better than a program manager who should be spending time on cross-functional coordination—something no one else can do. ([Location 1548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1548))
- Projects, which are organization or domain specific, don’t require a program manager’s skill set to move them forward and should not have a program manager assigned to them. Subject matter experts in the organization are actually the project managers (p. 15). They are able to run these projects themselves and should. ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1550))
- If a program manager provides too much assistance, then an organization may become dependent on them to run even the smallest project. ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1554))
- Program managers don’t want to create an organization full of leaders/managers who can’t run their own projects. The leaders should possess the skills required to run projects and develop them to be an all-around professional. ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1556))
- Business leads will no longer be accountable for their own work. They can’t be allowed to opt out of their responsibilities. They’re the subject matter experts and need to pull their weight and do the work expected of them by the program team. ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1560))
- Program managers are experts at running meetings and creating schedules, of course, but their time is better spent doing what they are best at: strategic execution. Said another way, they’re the best and only person to run a big, complex cross-functional program meeting or to create a complex schedule with many interdependencies. ([Location 1562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1562))
- Catching a moving train requires that you accelerate the usual program start-up process (p. 76). The first thing to do is quickly ascertain how far the train has already traveled and what work has been done. Then once you’ve managed to jump on board, it’s important to ask questions similar to those you would have asked at the start: ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1574))
- Is everything going well now? Or is it time to reorient the train, switching tracks if necessary to avoid wasting additional effort? ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1578))
- But if you’re solving the wrong problem, those miles traveled will be wasted anyway and there’s no sense in continuing down the wrong track. However, the program manager may need to use all the negotiating skills they have to put the brakes on the program and backtrack. ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1581))
- Since you are an objective program manager, your opinion isn’t what matters here. Your goal is simply to focus the team on the right problem and the work that will provide the right solution for the customer. ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1583))
- It’s frustrating to have to start over or backtrack and throw away work that’s no longer relevant. But continuing in the wrong direction is definitely worse. ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1588))
- Slowing or stopping the train and redirecting efforts requires that program managers play the important role of change manager: facilitating the team through change and getting the train moving again in the right direction with the right people on board. Halting a moving train is never fun! But once things get going in the right direction, the team will thank you. ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1592))
- The first thing to consider is who’s asking and determine why this request is important. As a team, you’ll need to decide if the request is more important than the work the team is already assigned to. Ask these questions before you proceed: Is this request in support of the company goals? Is it important enough that something should be bumped down the priority list? What work will be delayed if we take on this new request? Could the scope of an existing program be reduced to make this request happen? Are there underutilized resources that could be applied to this request? ([Location 1603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1603))
- But sometimes the team’s and the program’s priorities must shift. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1609))
## New highlights added January 25, 2025 at 3:30 PM
- Although program managers don’t make prioritization decisions, they do translate the request for support from a problem into a proposed solution and its impact. Then they enlist the leadership team for the organization they support to review the request and align everyone and determine next steps. ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1612))
- Like they say, the only constant is change. The important thing is that the program manager effectively manages that change with their program team and functional leadership to meet company goals. ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1617))
- Sometimes a break in the middle of a long program can be just the ticket for the team. ([Location 1622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1622))
- But the program manager deftly facilitated across the digital divide, ensuring progress, building relationships, and creating a wonderful virtual camaraderie I had not experienced before or since. ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1630))
- We put our work on hold for a few weeks while the dependent team completed their related work. The program team members appreciated the chance to shift focus and work on something different and, in some cases, less time critical. All of us returned to the program refreshed, renewed, and ready to complete the final months of the program. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1634))
- Program managers are the bridge over the cross-functional gaps that exist in most organizations. They bring people together, working to create alignment where diverse opinions exist and mediating disagreements; they facilitate and negotiate effectively. Program managers get involved in a program when there is a problem to solve or a business objective to meet, one that’s complex and cross-functional. ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1649))
- I recommend the program manager calmly point out the benefits to cross-functional collaboration (there’s no i in team) and encourage the team member to rejoin the effort. ([Location 1660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1660))
- But at some point, the program manager may need to accept that this particular individual just isn’t a team player. The program manager will need to let that difficult team member go it alone, and cross their fingers that all turns out well. ([Location 1666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1666))
- If you have to step away from a program, this is best done after a key milestone is met, or a key phase of a multi-phase program is completed. Then things can be handed over in a friendly and professional way, with the proviso that if the team wants the involvement of the PMO in the future, they shouldn’t hesitate to reach out. ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1668))
- But if someone repeatedly refuses the help of a program manager, you should be ready to walk away. Program managers always have plenty of other requests for their expertise! ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1673))
- The program manager happily reported, “We actually became friends by the end of the week!” From then on, despite the miles that separated the team members, technical problems were worked through speedily. ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1680))
- One solution to this conundrum is to get the entire team together in the same location periodically—it can make a world of difference. ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1683))
- For multi-phase programs, the team may gather in person to kick off each successive phase of work. But even if the team meets only once in person for a program, you’ll reap the rewards several months later when those employees are working through a difficult problem. ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1690))
- Lack of clarity up-front had the teams working at cross-purposes, and they didn’t realize it until they were all in the same physical room. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1695))
- But whether in person or virtual, as program managers, it’s your task to make these gatherings effective. Work with your teams to define clear goals up-front, get the right people in the room (minus those wanting to tag along for a free trip), create a detailed agenda, and document desired outcomes for each session before the gathering begins. Your teams may initially grumble at the structure, but they’ll thank you in the end. Pack your bags! ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1699))
- Along the way, I’ve talked about some of the skills that a program manager must have, including the ability to plan and schedule, to mitigate risks and close issues to keep a program on track, to effectively communicate status, and to educate yourself about the business of the teams you support. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1716))
- It’s the soft skills—or superpowers, as I like to call them—that make the difference between a good and a great program manager. ([Location 1718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1718))
- I ask questions to determine past behavior by focusing on situations that a program manager will face in order to assess if they are the right fit for the dynamics of the job. ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1723))
- Superpowers like getting someone to do something they don’t want to do or helping someone solve a problem or being comfortable working behind the scenes to make things happen. ([Location 1726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1726))
- An individual who takes time to get to know a person and has the patience to communicate well is more likely to be successful in getting a team member on board with a plan. You have to lay out the pros and cons and appeal to their sense of doing what’s right for the team and the program. And yes, sometimes this means playing to their ego. For that, you need to be cool and collected, and not everyone has access to that pool of calm. You can teach someone how to build a timeline or how to set up a risk register, but you can’t always teach someone to be unemotional if that’s who they are naturally. Training someone to be empathetic, to care about others’ problems is challenging. Without these superpowers, a candidate simply won’t make a great program manager. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1729))
- Super organized Proactive Strategic thinker Detail oriented Clear and concise communicator Relationship builder Rallies consensus Influences without authority Analytical Even-keeled temperament Supportive Good listener Empathetic Enjoys working behind the scenes ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1745))
- When you are hiring program managers, it’s crucial to assess the organizational skills of the candidates. If you’re an individual contributor (IC) program manager, much of what you are doing is organizing others to get a program across the line. ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1750))
- A good program manager is always thinking about the next few milestones in the plan and how they will get the team there. They think about the requirements for each milestone, who needs to be involved, and what they need to do, leaving nothing to chance. ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1753))
- The PMO is a services organization, and the program manager’s role is to understand the strategic context of the teams you support and to partner closely with them on a set of programs that achieve the team’s desired outcomes. This requires you as program manager to lean in and learn all you can, reaching out to your teams and stakeholders to build relationships, and understanding risks and proactively mitigating each and every one in the drive forward to reach the team’s goals. ([Location 1759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1759))
- Program managers need to be strategic thinkers so that they understand the context in which they are operating. This helps them effectively prioritize the initiatives of the teams they support. ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1763))
- They’re running complex programs and they need to understand the technical details enough to know when something is an issue. They need to have a good handle on the detailed program plan and interdependencies. ([Location 1770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1770))
- Program managers should also be able to communicate clearly and concisely, which is important when providing verbal or written status updates to management, team members, and key stakeholders. This individual is interested in productive conversation, open communication, and a free flow of information. ([Location 1773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1773))
- They are comfortable taking a back seat in support of open communication and leaning back in as needed to assert control to get the conversation back on track. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1777))
- Program managers need to understand the importance of building relationships such that they can lean on their colleagues to get work done (without micro-managing) and still be friends afterward. ([Location 1779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1779))
- These programs often involve varying and competing priorities, so the ability to rally consensus from a large group of diverse stakeholders in a pleasant and non-threatening way is critical. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1786))
- This skill involves reminding the group of the program goals or the train destination, if you will. You need to steer them away from their personal opinions or what would be easiest for their team by highlighting why the program exists in the first place. They need to align as a team on what’s best for the program. ([Location 1787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1787))
- You feel ownership for the success of the program and the program team who makes it happen, but no one reports to you. You have no authority to make anyone do anything. Instead, you need to have built the relationships and established the trust we spoke about above so that the team will listen to you. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1792))
- When I think about a program manager’s analytical skills, the ability to break complex systems or problems down into meaningful parts, it’s a saw that comes to mind. ([Location 1799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1799))
- Whatever the crisis, most people react emotionally and focus on the negative. The program manager is the one who calms everyone down and focuses on the solution and keeps everyone on the level ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1805))
- Whether you’re a trained psychologist or have a computer science background, the ability to be the calm person in the room is essential to being a successful program manager. ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1812))
- When you support your program team members, they are able to achieve more than they could on their own. You have their back in tough situations and are a shoulder to cry on. And you are the first to congratulate them when they’ve achieved a milestone. ([Location 1813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1813))
- What does it mean to be a good listener? It’s not just about hearing what a team member is saying. It’s about pausing, creating space, not interrupting when they hesitate, and listening deeply to what they’re saying. It’s about letting them speak and encouraging them to share. You’re 100 percent focused on what they’re saying. They’re the most important person in the room. ([Location 1816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1816))
- The best program managers are empathetic. They can tune in to a team member’s emotions and will experience that same emotion. For example, they sense when a team member is struggling and automatically share in that struggle. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1820))
- Finally, when I’m hiring a program manager, I always make sure that they enjoy working behind the scenes and are uninterested in the spotlight. They get their kicks from seeing things run smoothly due to good communication and planning. ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1824))
- One of the benefits of a centralized PMO (p. 24) is having a set of program managers who are trained in a consistent methodology, who work in the same way across organizations. If you want this to happen across your company, the place to start is with onboarding. ([Location 1834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1834))
- Here’s a suggested outline for onboarding topics: ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1840))
- Learn about PMO culture and best practices Mission, vision, values The company’s annual planning process Setting up and running a program Status reporting (p. 78) ([Location 1849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1849))
- Acquire additional knowledge Issue and risk management best practices (p. 83) Meeting management best practices (p. 123) How the company’s products and services are built How to partner with your PMO colleagues on programs ([Location 1862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1862))
- Over the remainder of their first three months on the job, the program manager should continue their long-term education, which includes going deep on the organization(s) they support, learning about other related parts of the business, and presenting this knowledge to their manager and peers. (If you can explain it, you understand it.) ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1870))
- Finally, I like to encourage each new program manager to find a domain in which to gain expertise, usually an area they’re interested in and enthusiastic about, with the understanding that they may turn that into an onboarding session for the PMO one day. ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1872))
- As your PMO practice evolves and the needs of the company change, I recommend you add new content to your onboarding, keep existing content updated, and retire any items no longer relevant on an ongoing basis. ([Location 1876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1876))
- If a team member delivers an onboarding or reboarding (p. 191) session and feels that it’s not up to date or up to par, I see it as their responsibility to either update it or contact the original author or their manager to get it updated. This is a team effort. ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1880))
- A comprehensive onboarding program is critical to developing a team of strong performers who program manage in a high-quality and consistent way. They’ll be better equipped for their role, be more motivated, and feel loyal to the PMO and the company as a whole. ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1883))
- Where possible, I assign a buddy who supports the same or a related organization and can therefore provide helpful context as needed. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1888))
- I’ve found that short daily check-ins for the first few weeks are helpful, and a longer weekly session allows for more in-depth conversations. ([Location 1895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1895))
- it’s helpful to have a buddy at the same level as the new hire, so they feel comfortable to ask anything without fear of judgment. ([Location 1897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1897))
- Sharing the inside scoop on what may or may not work with a particular person or team can save a newbie a lot of time. ([Location 1899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1899))
- I also recommend you document what the buddy program entails so that both program managers are clear on what’s expected of them. ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1900))
- A buddy isn’t a substitute for a manager nor are they expected to be a mentor. Their role is more about introducing the new program manager around, being available for questions, making sure the new hire is well integrated into the team and company, and providing that safe sounding board. ([Location 1902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1902))
- Consider including a checklist for the buddy in your documentation ([Location 1904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3CYTS9&location=1904))

### User - 2025-03-17 17:19:56

Overall impression: Met expectations
Writing style: practical
Real world application: Seemed applicable if you have the right size / shape of organization

Key takeaways:
- Don't start a program management office too early; wait until you have program shaped work to do
- Building a PMO is about setting up the role of the department with the rest of the organization as much as it is about getting good individuals into the role
- The key skill of program management is risk management 

Resonate: The bit on staying strategic and not becoming just a note taker / status manager resonated

Alignment with practice: Aligned well
Experience level:  more relevant for experienced folks. the book is targeted at leaders building a PMO, not individual program managers

New or surprising: Framing PMO to the rest of the org was new to me

Did well: Good mix of examples and generalized system
Gone deeper: All of the sections were deep enough but given the nature of the book, none were super deep (and that was fine)
Repetitive, unnecessary, or lacking in substance: not really

Comparison to other books / recommend to others: I would recommend this book to leaders who are deciding if and how to build up a program management team

Practical application: Yes, it was practical

Personal reflection: reinforced what I already believe. More of a one time read

### Assistant - 2025-03-17 17:19:56

This is great input! Based on your responses, I’ll craft a structured, objective review that reflects your insights while staying informative. Here’s the summary:

## **Book Review: *Get on Track* by Paula Dieli**  

### **Overall Impression**  
*Get on Track* met expectations as a practical and well-structured guide to establishing and scaling a Program Management Office (PMO). It provides actionable insights that are applicable primarily to organizations at the right size and stage of maturity. While not groundbreaking, the book effectively reinforces best practices for experienced professionals looking to formalize program management structures.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. **Timing Matters** – The book emphasizes that organizations should not rush into building a PMO. Instead, a PMO should be introduced only when the company’s work requires strategic coordination across multiple teams.  
2. **Positioning the PMO** – Establishing a program management function is as much about aligning the department’s role within the broader organization as it is about hiring strong individuals.  
3. **Risk Management is Central** – The book reinforces that effective program management is fundamentally about risk identification, mitigation, and resolution.  

### **What Resonated Most**  
The discussion on **staying strategic as a program manager** stood out. The book stresses that program managers should avoid falling into the trap of being mere status reporters or note-takers. Instead, they should focus on driving alignment, enabling cross-functional execution, and ensuring that the most critical risks are addressed.  

### **Intended Audience & Practicality**  
This book is **best suited for experienced professionals, particularly leaders tasked with structuring and scaling a PMO**. Unlike introductory books on program management, *Get on Track* is tailored for those making decisions about **when and how to introduce program management as a function within a company**. The practical guidance is useful, but its applicability depends on whether an organization has reached the stage where program-level coordination is necessary.  

### **Strengths**  
- **Balanced mix of examples and general frameworks** – The book provides a structured approach without being overly rigid, making it adaptable to different organizational contexts.  
- **Clear, practical writing** – The concepts are explained in a straightforward way that makes them easy to digest and apply.  
- **Covers the "how" and "why" of a PMO** – The book not only explains how to implement program management but also how to position and communicate its value within the organization.  

### **Areas for Improvement**  
- While the book covers a broad range of PMO-related topics, none of them go into extreme depth. However, given the book’s purpose, this high-level treatment felt appropriate.  
- The book is **not targeted at individual program managers** looking to refine their craft, but rather at leaders defining the function within their company.  

### **Comparison & Recommendation**  
Compared to other books on program management, *Get on Track* is **less about execution and more about PMO strategy**. It is **recommended for senior leaders, directors, or executives evaluating whether and how to introduce a PMO**. For program managers looking to refine their tactical skills, other books might be a better fit.  

### **Final Thoughts**  
This book is a **one-time read** that effectively consolidates best practices for building and scaling a PMO. While it doesn’t radically challenge existing program management principles, it serves as a valuable **practical guide for leaders making strategic decisions about program management functions**.  

Would you like any refinements to this, or does this align with how you’d like the review to read?

### User - 2025-03-17 17:21:09

Get rid of all the bold text and the sections. Make the Strengths and Areas for improvement more narrative than lists. Make the whole thing a bit more concise.

### Assistant - 2025-03-17 17:21:10

*Get on Track* by Paula Dieli met expectations as a practical and well-structured guide to establishing and scaling a Program Management Office (PMO). It provides actionable insights that are most relevant to organizations at the right size and stage of maturity. While not groundbreaking, the book effectively reinforces best practices for experienced professionals looking to formalize program management structures.  

The book emphasizes that a PMO shouldn’t be built too early—there needs to be a real need for program-level coordination before introducing the function. More than just hiring skilled individuals, establishing a PMO is about defining its role within the company and ensuring it is positioned correctly. At its core, effective program management is about risk management, and the book underscores how program managers should focus on mitigating risks rather than simply reporting on status or taking notes. This emphasis on staying strategic resonated, reinforcing the importance of program managers driving alignment and execution rather than being administrative support.  

Dieli presents a well-balanced mix of examples and frameworks, offering a clear, practical approach that makes the book easy to apply in real-world settings. The writing is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity, making it accessible to its intended audience. While the book covers a broad range of topics, none go especially deep, but that’s appropriate given its focus. This is not a book for individual program managers refining their tactical skills; rather, it is aimed at leaders determining how to introduce and structure program management within their organization.  

For those deciding whether to build a PMO and how to set it up for success, *Get on Track* is a useful, one-time read. It serves as a solid reference for senior leaders evaluating the need for program management, though its impact will depend on whether the reader’s organization is at the right stage for this kind of function.

### Assistant - 2025-03-17 17:29:35

*Get on Track* by Paula Dieli is a practical guide to establishing and scaling a Program Management Office (PMO) within an organization. It outlines the strategic role of program management, emphasizing that a PMO should not be created too early but rather in response to a genuine need for cross-functional coordination. The book differentiates program management from project management, positioning it as a discipline focused on driving strategic execution, managing risk, and ensuring alignment across teams. Dieli provides a structured approach to defining the PMO’s purpose, integrating it into the company’s culture, and communicating its value to stakeholders.  

The book is aimed at experienced professionals—particularly leaders who are considering how to implement or expand program management in their organization. It balances real-world examples with general frameworks, illustrating key concepts without being overly prescriptive. Dieli highlights the importance of program managers staying strategic rather than becoming status reporters or note-takers, reinforcing the role as one of proactive risk mitigation and cross-functional coordination. While the book does not dive deeply into any single topic, it offers a comprehensive overview of what it takes to build and run an effective PMO. Practical and well-structured, *Get on Track* is a useful resource for leaders who want to ensure program management adds real value rather than becoming an administrative function.

        - Explore the various ways to fund the PMO, such as a model where the organization requesting a program manager funds the headcount but leaves the management of the program manager to the PMO. This can be combined with a centralized funding model to meet the needs of all types of organizations.
        - Train the PMO on the importance of diversity and inclusion, build it into the hiring process, and ensure the work environment is inclusive.

        - Schedules are vital. You wouldn't start a train trip without knowing where you're going and how long it's going to take. Because programs are strategic and cross-functional, make sure you have a good schedule in place and that everyone is aware of and aligned with the key milestones.
        - A program kickoff allows everyone to understand the program goals, get on board with the schedule, and confirm who's doing what. It also builds momentum and team spirit to carry you through those rough patches.

            - Product managers understand customer requirements and work with the team to develop solutions to customer problems.
            - Operations managers ensure effective processes are in place.
            - Functional project managers are responsible for specific functional workstreams.
            - Program managers bring it all home with overall coordination.

    - No Notes Please!
    - Key Takeaways (quoted)
        - Effective program meetings focus on upcoming milestones, open issues, increasing risks, and gathering alignment as the program moves forward.
        - The program manager should spend time with the team they support throughout the work week in order to gather status rather than doing it in a meeting.
        - Limit laptop use by meeting participants so that you don't have to repeat yourself because someone is not paying attention to the discussion.
        - Running retrospectives during a program allows program team members to course correct as needed. Retrospectives at the end of a program are a good way to make sure future programs run more effectively.
        - When you flag items green, yellow, or red in a status report, this allows team members, leadership, and stakeholders to know how a program is progressing and if expectations are set correctly.
        - Ask a PMO colleague to review your status report before it goes out to ensure it's clear, accurate, and doesn't single out a person or a team unfairly.
        - Avoid taking notes in a program meeting so you can focus instead on what's coming next in the program and what's being said (or not). Keep your eyes on the participants to ensure alignment.

        - Some people don't know they need program management until they see it in action.
        - Avoid the trap of fixing everyone and everything just because you are asked and you can. Focus on strategic execution and leave projects to the business team with the subject matter expertise to ensure accountability.
        - Jumping into a program in progress is challenging because stopping work or backtracking is often met with resistance. But there's no sense in continuing down the same track if you're solving the wrong problem!
        - Change is constant. A program manager effectively manages that change with their program team and leadership to achieve company goals.
        - Sometimes taking a spring break during a long program is a good thing.
        - Know when to walk away, if someone doesn't want the help of a program manager or is uncooperative.

The book is divided into three parts, guiding readers through the process of building, running, and refining a Program Management Office (PMO). It begins by establishing what program management is and how it differs from project management. The early chapters focus on when and why a PMO should be created, emphasizing that program management should be introduced when cross-functional coordination becomes a challenge. The book provides strategies for structuring and funding the PMO, ensuring it is positioned for efficiency and effectiveness. A key theme is the importance of branding the PMO—clearly defining its role, setting expectations within the organization, and ensuring that program managers remain strategic rather than becoming administrative overhead. The first section also covers fundamental aspects of program execution, including setting success measures, running effective program meetings, and managing risks proactively.

The second part shifts to the operational side of managing a PMO, covering stakeholder relationships, effective meetings, and decision-making frameworks. It discusses the importance of aligning program management with business leadership and highlights the various roles that program managers interact with, such as executive sponsors, business leads, and product managers. The book also explores the nuances of status reporting, retrospectives, and risk management, reinforcing that program managers should be proactive facilitators rather than passive administrators. Additionally, it provides insight into common challenges such as jumping into a program mid-stream, managing remote teams, and recognizing when a PMO is being used as a crutch rather than as a strategic function.

The final section focuses on professional development and the evolving nature of program management. It details the key skills that program managers should cultivate, from organization and communication to influencing without authority and handling ambiguity. The book also introduces the concept of "pair program management" and explores career growth, including the importance of continuous learning, mentoring, and expanding one's impact beyond the immediate organization. The conclusion ties everything together with a concise roadmap for building and sustaining a PMO, ensuring that it remains a dynamic and valuable part of the company’s strategic execution.
