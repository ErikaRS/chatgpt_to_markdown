(Other than people management specific tasks like performance management, everything in this doc applies to team and project leads too.)

At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time… and it feels like everything needed to be done yesterday. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, prioritize effectively, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed.

Every company has its own needs, and impactful managers at Sourcegraph won’t always look like impactful managers at other companies. In some environments, managers should effectively execute the plan, focus on their defined roles, assign specific tasks, or adhere to established processes. At Sourcegraph, we need managers who define the plan, are flexible, generate high trust and agency, and  are hands-on problem solvers. Time moves faster here—what might take weeks or months at other companies, we condense into days or weeks.

### **Ineffective managers: fixers, phantoms, and friends**

Ineffective managers fall into three categories: **fixers, phantoms,** or **friends**.

- The **fixer** jumps in at every issue, giving step-by-step instructions and solving problems themselves. This undermines autonomy, leaves engineers dependent, and stifles creativity. Fixers struggle to delegate and fail to develop their team's skills, ultimately slowing the team down.
- The **phantom** assumes autonomy means hands-off management, offering little guidance. They avoid involvement, leaving the team without direction or support. This often leads to misalignment, wasted effort, and poor outcomes due to a lack of oversight and structure.
- The **friend** coddles their team, fails to deliver results, and cannot effectively challenge ideas. They rely on secondhand information and avoid getting into the code when needed, which causes drag and divides the team from the company.

All three approaches hinder high agency: fixers smother it, phantoms let it run without guidance, and friends decouple it from meaningful results.

### **The impactful manager: coaches and catalysts**

Impactful managers act as **coaches**, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute. They are also **catalysts** who ensure impact and accountability by setting clear expectations, monitoring progress, and doing their part to keep projects on track. They balance empowerment with hands-on involvement to ensure that delivery standards and deadlines are consistently met.

### **1. Deliver business needs**

Impactful managers ensure engineering delivers outcomes that benefit the business. They make sure developers don't just understand customer needs—they feel them. This enables devs to iterate quickly toward high quality solutions through **internalized feedback loops**.

Impactful managers understand that engineering doesn’t exist in a bubble. They ensure **cross-team and cross-functional alignment**, collaborating closely with Product, Design, TPM, Technical Success, and Marketing. When cross-functional partners are unavailable, impactful managers **advocate for those perspectives**, making decisions that reflect the business as a whole. This helps ensure that engineering efforts are always aligned with larger priorities.

One of the biggest challenges we face is balancing customer-specific work with work that benefits the broader user base. Customer requests can be urgent and critical for business success, but the long-term health of the product depends on improvements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this **balance**, pushing back if customer requests are impeding their ability to progress on other work.

**Techniques for this:**

- **Encourage internalized feedback loops** by ensuring developers use our products in their work and directly watch/read/gather customer feedback.
- **Cross-functional meetings** to ensure alignment with stakeholders.
- **Clear prioritization** to weigh customer-specific work against broader product goals.
- **Acting as an advocate** for stakeholders, ensuring decisions reflect the full company perspective.

Ineffective managers either prioritize short-term customer work to the detriment of the broader product or overlook customer needs, causing friction between teams.

### **2. Make sure teams get the right things done**

Starting work is easy... but **finishing is what delivers value**. Impactful managers are hands-on, working alongside their teams when needed, whether by participating in coding or providing direct feedback. They ensure teams prioritize tasks that deliver the most value to customers and the business. Every engineer should understand how their work moves the business and the developer experience forward.

Exactly how the manager does this will vary by team. All managers should be able to provide insightful technical guidance (and “call BS” if needed), represent the team in technical discussions, and jump in when to fill gaps. On teams with strong TLs, the TL will be responsible for creating more of the artifacts while the manager gives feedback and makes connections to other works. On teams where the manager is acting as the TL, they will be the one doing much of that artifact creation. Managers who lead multiple teams will likely be in both roles at the same time, based on the needs of different teams.

Techniques for this:

- **Prioritization** of projects in Linear, getting stakeholder input and escalating decisions when needed.
- **Time-boxing** work to focus on deliverables.
- **Regular check-ins** to ensure alignment on goals and progress on top priorities.
- **Understanding the gaps** and jumping in when there is a gap to be filled.

Ineffective managers either allow the team to spread too thin or fail to prioritize, leading to activity without output.

### **3. Cultivate high agency**

Impactful managers build autonomy by **asking the right questions** rather than providing all the answers. When engineers face challenges, impactful managers guide them to think through solutions, helping them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.

However, they **don’t make people guess**. There are times when providing answers directly is crucial, especially when clarity is needed quickly. Impactful managers balance these approaches, ensuring that engineers can act fast, take ownership, and make decisions in the best interest of developers and the business. 

Techniques for this:

- **One-on-one coaching** to help engineers think critically.
- **Socratic questioning** to guide engineers to solutions.
- **Feedback on RFCs and project overviews** to help engineers outline their thought process.

Ineffective managers either solve problems themselves or fail to address them, preventing engineers from growing their autonomy.

### **4. Assess team performance**

Who is on the team is likely the single most important factor in team success. Impactful managers assess their team members to understand how best to utilize their strengths. They identify **bullets**—people who can effectively execute tasks when given clear direction—and **barrels**—people who can "aim" and take ownership of a project end to end. Delegating effectively means knowing which tasks are best suited for bullets and which require the strategic ownership of barrels. (The same person will play different roles on different projects.)

Flagging signs of underperformance quickly is crucial. Impactful managers deliver **direct feedback** to address issues early, ensuring that everyone is set up to contribute effectively to the team's goals.

**Techniques for this:**

- **Identify bullets and barrels** to understand team strengths and delegate effectively. ([Blog post on bullets and barrels](https://www.conordewey.com/blog/barrels-and-ammunition/).)
- **Deliver direct feedback** to address underperformance early.
- **Set clear expectations** to ensure alignment on responsibilities and outcomes.

Ineffective managers let performance problems drift, either burying them or letting them boil over at impact review time. 

### **5. Create conditions for effective execution**

Impactful managers set **clear goals** aligned with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. Projects should be well scoped and defined, giving teams clarity and purpose without micromanagement.

Impactful managers encourage developers to **get into the zone** where they internalize feedback loops as much as possible. This state allows them to make rapid, informed decisions that boost productivity and enjoyment. Anything outside this zone is significantly less productive and less enjoyable.

Impactful managers enable alignment and accountability by **promoting transparency** within their teams and across the entire organization. They create a culture where honest feedback is encouraged, allowing teams to learn quickly from both successes and failures.

Impactful managers **trust their engineers to execute** once the goals are clear, but they do not abdicate their responsibility. They actively monitor progress, provide timely feedback, and intervene when necessary to ensure that delivery meets quality and time expectations. They expect engineers to take responsibility for delivering results, while maintaining transparency in how progress is communicated. When roles and responsibilities are clearly assigned, teams can work autonomously while staying connected to the broader vision.

**Techniques for this:**

- **Getting into the zone** by internalizing feedback loops to make rapid and informed decisions.
- **Kickoff meetings** should define objectives, set expectations, and assign clear roles.
- **Transparent communication** provides open information flow and regular feedback.
- **Clear roles and responsibilities** enable alignment while preserving autonomy.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving teams without a clear sense of purpose. Without transparency and clear guidance, teams lose focus and momentum, ultimately reducing the impact of their work.

### **6. Balance speed and stability**

Speed and stability are not at odds; they should go hand in hand. True velocity **pairs fast execution with solutions that enable greater stability** in the future. Impactful managers ensure that engineers build solutions that meet today’s needs well, while also laying the foundation for future growth. We strive for simple, robust, and easy-to-modify code, which allows us to move quickly without compromising quality. This means addressing today’s problems efficiently, without overbuilding or accumulating technical debt.

Impactful managers hold a high bar for both speed and stability, recognizing that sustainable speed is achieved through **maintaining quality**. Engineers are expected to take ownership of their code’s quality—delivering quickly while ensuring the codebase remains scalable and maintainable.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to velocity investments—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. (Testing and documentation are always required.) This approach reduces technical debt build up. Additionally, impactful managers identify code hotspots that slow development and prioritize cleanup projects to address them.

**Techniques for this:**

- **Schedule planning** that accounts for 25% of time for velocity improvements.
- **Tracking hotspots** in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.

Ineffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term stability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt. Or they allow their teams to build over-engineered designs that are hard to modify as requirements change. Both these create teams that execute slowly.

### **7. Celebrate wins and build resilience**

Impactful managers celebrate wins and frame failures as opportunities to drive future success. They **celebrate wins**, big or small. They **frame failure as a learning opportunity**, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.

Techniques for this:

- **Demo days and company demos** to showcase achievements and celebrate progress.
- **Retrospectives** to learn from mistakes (and successes!) without assigning blame.
- **Public recognition** (e.g., in #thanks and #progress) to reinforce team successes and build momentum.

Ineffective managers either ignore achievements or punish failure, creating a culture of fear rather than innovation.

### **Conclusion: nurture high-performing teams**

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers empower their teams to focus on what matters, take action, and deliver real value to customers and the business. They are hands-on. They create an environment where autonomy thrives, accountability is embraced, and every challenge is an opportunity to learn and improve.

Add a section "Help teams grow" which integrates these comments:
Comment 1:
Thanks for sharing this, I have a lot to learn from it as a TL! One thing not really covered here is the social aspect of building a team — people who work really well together, and produce work at a higher quality and velocity than they would in a silo. I’d love to learn more about how we think about team building Sourcegraph. This might include topics like — giving space to develop expertise in a domain and area of the code, facilitating honest but respectful disagreement, etc.

Comment 2: 
Related to my comment about team building, I personally really like when we favor “team-based thanks” and progress announcements over individual callouts. Because often a whole team contributed (even if it was X person covering a tough support shift while Y person could work on the #progress item).

When roles and responsibilities are clearly assigned, teams can work autonomously while staying connected to the broader vision.\n\n**Techniques for this:**\n\n- **Getting into the zone** by internalizing feedback loops to make rapid and informed decisions.\n- **Kickoff meetings** should define objectives, set expectations, and assign clear roles.\n- **Transparent communication** provides open information flow and regular feedback.\n- **Clear roles and responsibilities** enable alignment while preserving autonomy.\n\nIneffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving teams without a clear sense of purpose. Without transparency and clear guidance, teams lose focus and momentum, ultimately reducing the impact of their work.\n\n### **6. Balance speed and stability**\n\nSpeed and stability are not at odds; they should go hand in hand. True velocity **pairs fast execution with solutions that enable greater stability** in the future. Impactful managers ensure that engineers build solutions that meet today’s needs well, while also laying the foundation for future growth. We strive for simple, robust, and easy-to-modify code, which allows us to move quickly without compromising quality. This means addressing today’s problems efficiently, without overbuilding or accumulating technical debt.\n\nImpactful managers hold a high bar for both speed and stability, recognizing that sustainable speed is achieved through **maintaining quality**. Engineers are expected to take ownership of their code’s quality—delivering quickly while ensuring the codebase remains scalable and maintainable.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to velocity investments—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. (Testing and documentation are always required.) This approach reduces technical debt build up. Additionally, impactful managers identify code hotspots that slow development and prioritize cleanup projects to address them.\n\n**Techniques for this:**\n\n- **Schedule planning** that accounts for 25% of time for velocity improvements.\n- **Tracking hotspots** in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.\n\nIneffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term stability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt. Or they allow their teams to build over-engineered designs that are hard to modify as requirements change. Both these create teams that execute slowly.\n\n### **7. Celebrate wins and build resilience**\n\nImpactful managers celebrate wins and frame failures as opportunities to drive future success. They **celebrate wins**, big or small. They **frame failure as a learning opportunity**, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.\n\n**Techniques for this:**\n\n- **Demo days and company demos** to showcase achievements and celebrate progress.\n- **Retrospectives** to learn from mistakes (and successes!) without assigning blame.\n- **Public recognition** (e.g., in #thanks and #progress) to reinforce team successes and build momentum.\n\nIneffective managers either ignore achievements or punish failure, creating a culture of fear rather than innovation.\n\n### **8. Help teams grow**\n\nImpactful managers understand that team growth is both a technical and social process. They focus on building teams that work well together, fostering an environment where collaboration and shared ownership lead to higher quality and velocity of work than individuals operating in silos.\n\nA key part of team growth is allowing space for engineers to **develop expertise** in specific domains and areas of the codebase. This helps build a sense of ownership and deepens the team's collective understanding of the product. Impactful managers also **facilitate honest but respectful disagreement**, ensuring that differing perspectives can be voiced and resolved productively. This strengthens the team’s problem-solving capacity and resilience.\n\nAnother important aspect is recognizing contributions at the **team level**. Impactful managers favor **team-based thanks** and progress announcements over individual callouts, as impactful results are often the product of collective effort. This approach emphasizes shared success and reinforces the value of teamwork, acknowledging the contributions of all team members, whether they are directly responsible for a significant feature or supporting others to make it happen.\n\n**Techniques for this:**\n\n- **Domain expertise development** by giving engineers time and space to work deeply in specific areas.\n- **Facilitating constructive disagreement** during meetings to ensure diverse viewpoints are considered.\n- **Team-based recognition** in #thanks and #progress channels to highlight the contributions of the whole team.\n\nIneffective managers overlook the social aspects of team growth, either focusing solely on technical skills or failing to cultivate an environment of collaboration and respect.\n\n### **Conclusion: nurture high-performing teams**\n\nAt Sourcegraph, impactful managers empower their teams to focus on what matters, take action, and deliver real value to customers and the business. They are hands-on. They create an environment where autonomy thrives, accountability is embraced, and every challenge is an opportunity to learn and improve."
