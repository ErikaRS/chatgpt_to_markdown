"I'm sorry" can express an apology or express empathy. Sometimes when used to express empathy in a situation where it's not clear which sense it's being used as, it can come across as a passive-agressive non-apology. What's an alternate phrasing for the following sentence which expresses empathy without sounding like a non-apology.

"I am sorry to hear that you continue to feel disappointed. "

Certainly! Here's an alternative phrasing that emphasizes empathy without sounding like a non-apology:

"It's unfortunate to hear that you're still feeling disappointed."

Of course! Here are three more alternative phrasings:

1. "It saddens me to hear that you're still feeling this way."
2. "I'm genuinely concerned to learn that your disappointment persists."
3. "It's disheartening to know you're still grappling with those feelings."
