Write a haiku on the physical sensations one experiences at a Puget sound Beach. Do not mention the location by name. Just focus on the sensations

Chilly breeze whispers,  
Tidal waves kiss pebbled shores,  
Seagulls cry above.

Update it for a warm but not too warm summer day. No need to mention the weather directly. Just capture the essence

Soft sand 'neath bare feet,  
Gentle waves embrace the shore,  
Seagulls dance on blue.

Breeze cools the warm skin,
Tidal waves kiss pebbled shores,
Seagulls cry above.

That's a lovely haiku capturing the balance of warmth and the refreshing touch of nature on a summer day by the sea. Well done!

Complete this haiku, still on a Puget sound Beach: 
Pink shell in my hand,

Whispers tales of ancient tides,  
Seagulls watch from high.

Compose a sonnet to a summer day on the Puget sound Beach

Upon the shores of Puget's grand expanse,  
A summer's day unfolds its gentle dance.  
The golden sun reflects on waters clear,  
Where waves and sand in timeless waltz appear.  

The distant calls of seagulls pierce the sky,  
While boats sail by with breezes as ally.  
Soft grains of sand, like memories, do cling,  
To feet that wander, and to hearts that sing.

The ebb and flow, like life's own pulsing beat,  
With every tide, the old and new shall meet.  
The azure depths, with secrets yet untold,  
Hold tales of ages, in their silence, bold.

So, Puget's shores, on summer's radiant day,  
You steal my heart and whisk my soul away.
