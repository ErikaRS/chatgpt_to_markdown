I am writing a promotion announcement for a software engineering. The goals are 
- recognizing the hard work of the individual being promoted
- providing insight into the individual’s new responsibilities
- how the teammate’s performance and actions embody our values
- serving as aspirational to others who strive to be promoted in the future

Below is my draft. Please critique it relative to those goals and for general style feedback.

Happy Friday everyone! I am excited to announce that @Varun Gandhi has been promoted to IC4! :rocket: 

For the past not-quite two years, Varun has been helping to advance our code intelligence. Varun has deep technical skills and a meticulous attention to detail enable him to solve hard problems with visible impact.  C++ is an important language in the industry, and Varun created a SCIP indexer for C++. Anyone who knows C++ can tell is a feat. This work was critical in conversations with Citadel and in continuing to pay dividends as we talk to Nvidia. He has also worked on indexing for other languages important to customers like Ruby and TypeScript. He dramatically reduced resource usage by making code indexing streaming, and he has generally up leveled our indexing code. 

Going forward, Varun will continue to work on code intelligence as part of the Graph team, making sure that Sourcegraph continues to set the bar on understanding and utilizing the structure of code to deliver user value.

Your draft is well-structured and does a good job of recognizing Varun's accomplishments. I'll provide feedback based on the goals you've outlined and also make some style suggestions.

### Feedback:

#### 1. Recognizing the hard work of the individual being promoted
Your draft does this well by highlighting Varun's achievements. 

#### 2. Providing insight into the individual’s new responsibilities
You've mentioned that Varun will continue to work on code intelligence as part of the Graph team, but it might be beneficial to elaborate a little more on what his new responsibilities might entail as an IC4.

#### 3. How the teammate’s performance and actions embody your values
You've touched on Varun's deep technical skills and meticulous attention to detail. However, you might consider explicitly tying these traits back to the company's values. If your company has specific core values, this would be a good place to highlight how Varun embodies them.

#### 4. Serving as aspirational to others
You've showcased Varun's achievements, which can serve as an inspiration to others. However, you could add a line encouraging other team members to follow Varun's example or expressing hope that this serves as motivation for others.

### Style Feedback:
1. Avoid repeating phrases like "Varun" at the beginning of sentences to ensure varied sentence structure.
2. Clarify or expand on certain terms, like "IC4", if not everyone in the audience will immediately understand their significance.
3. Consider rephrasing the part about "Anyone who knows C++ can tell is a feat." for clarity.

### Revised Version:
```
Happy Friday everyone! I am thrilled to announce that @Varun Gandhi has been promoted to the role of IC4! :rocket:

In under two years, Varun has made significant strides in advancing our code intelligence. His deep technical expertise and unyielding attention to detail have empowered him to tackle challenging problems with tangible impact. Notably, his creation of a SCIP indexer for C++, recognized by those familiar with C++ as a remarkable achievement, proved crucial in our conversations with Citadel and continues to be invaluable as we engage with Nvidia. Beyond this, Varun has enhanced our indexing for other customer-centric languages like Ruby and TypeScript, and has innovatively reduced resource usage by transitioning code indexing to streaming.

As Varun steps into his new role, he will further bolster our code intelligence within the Graph team. His mission will be ensuring that Sourcegraph consistently leads the way in comprehending and leveraging the structure of code to maximize user value. We are confident in Varun's abilities to excel in this new capacity and hope his journey serves as an inspiration to all team members aspiring for growth and excellence.
```

Remember, these are just suggestions. The final decision on wording and style rests with you, and should reflect the culture and values of your company.
