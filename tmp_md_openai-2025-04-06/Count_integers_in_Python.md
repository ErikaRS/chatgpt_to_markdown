Show me two ways of writing python code which takes a list of integers and returns a map from values to count of that value in the input. Explain the pros and cons of each option.

Sure! Here are two ways to achieve that in Python:

Option 1: Using a dictionary

```python
def count_elements(lst):
    counts = {}
    for elem in lst:
        if elem in counts:
            counts[elem] += 1
        else:
            counts[elem] = 1
    return counts
```

Option 2: Using the `collections` module

```python
from collections import Counter

def count_elements(lst):
    return Counter(lst)
```

Both options will take a list of integers and return a dictionary with the count of each value in the list. The difference between the two options is in the implementation.

Pros and Cons of option 1:
- Pros:
  - It's a simple implementation that uses only core Python constructs, so it's easy to understand.
  - It can be modified to perform more complex operations, such as counting the frequency of words in a text.
- Cons:
  - It requires more code to achieve the same result as the `Counter` method.
  - It's not as efficient as the `Counter` method, especially for large lists.

Pros and Cons of option 2:
- Pros:
  - It's a one-liner implementation that uses the `collections` module, so it's concise and easy to read.
  - It's highly efficient, especially for large lists, as the `Counter` method is optimized for counting.
- Cons:
  - It requires the `collections` module, which may not be available in all Python installations.
  - It's less flexible than the dictionary implementation, as it only counts elements in the list.
