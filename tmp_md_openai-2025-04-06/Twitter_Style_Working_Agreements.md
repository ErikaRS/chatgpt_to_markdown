Creating a good working agreement between two teams that have previously experienced tension involves careful consideration of elements that foster understanding, trust, and collaborative success. Here are key elements to include:

1. **Clear Communication Channels and Protocols:** Establish open, transparent, and regular communication lines. Define how and when teams will communicate, including which platforms to use and frequency.

2. **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms:** Outline procedures for resolving disputes, including escalation paths and mediation processes. Encourage constructive feedback and proactive problem-solving.

3. **Defined Roles and Responsibilities:** Clarify each team member's roles and responsibilities to prevent overlaps and gaps, ensuring accountability and reducing misunderstandings.

4. **Shared Goals and Objectives:** Establish common goals that both teams agree upon to ensure alignment. This helps in focusing efforts on shared outcomes rather than differences.

5. **Mutual Respect and Trust:** Commit to fostering a culture of respect, where every team member's contributions are valued. Building trust takes time but is foundational for collaboration.

6. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Recognize the need for flexibility in working practices and be willing to adapt based on feedback and changing circumstances.

7. **Recognition and Appreciation:** Create mechanisms to acknowledge and celebrate the contributions and successes of both teams, reinforcing positive interactions.

8. **Regular Check-ins and Adjustments:** Schedule periodic reviews of the working agreement to assess its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments. This ensures the agreement evolves with the teamsâ€™ needs.

9. **Transparency and Accountability:** Ensure all actions, decisions, and processes are transparent to both teams, with clear accountability for delivering on commitments.

10. **Inclusive Decision-Making:** Involve members of both teams in decision-making processes, especially for decisions that affect both groups, to ensure buy-in and respect for diverse perspectives.

This framework should be developed collaboratively, with input from all team members, to ensure buy-in and commitment. Remember, the goal is to build a positive, productive relationship moving forward, so focusing on mutual success rather than past tensions is key.
