Here is the extracted text:

It seems there are some symbols like `~` before a few numbers that might not belong. I will clean up the data and calculate the sum.

```unknown
import re

# Clean up the extracted text and isolate numbers
lines = extracted_text.splitlines()
numbers = []

for line in lines:
    # Extract valid monetary values with potential negative sign
    match = re.search(r'-?\$[0-9,]+\.\d{2}', line)
    if match:
        # Remove the dollar sign and commas, then convert to float
        num = match.group().replace('$', '').replace(',', '')
        numbers.append(float(num))

# Calculate the sum
total_sum = sum(numbers)
total_sum

The total sum of the numbers is **$17,865.01**. Let me know if you need further analysis or adjustments!

The ~ are actually - signs to indicate negative numbers. Try again

```unknown
# Replace '~' with '-' in the text
corrected_text = extracted_text.replace('~', '-')

# Clean up the corrected text and isolate numbers
lines_corrected = corrected_text.splitlines()
numbers_corrected = []

for line in lines_corrected:
    # Extract valid monetary values with potential negative sign
    match = re.search(r'-?\$[0-9,]+\.\d{2}', line)
    if match:
        # Remove the dollar sign and commas, then convert to float
        num = match.group().replace('$', '').replace(',', '')
        numbers_corrected.append(float(num))

# Calculate the new total sum
corrected_total_sum = sum(numbers_corrected)

The total sum of the numbers, correcting the `~` to `-` for negative values, is **-$3,956.39**. Let me know if you need anything else!
