Pivot tables are a feature found in various data processing software, like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and others, which allow users to reorganize and summarize selected columns and rows of data in a spreadsheet or database to obtain a desired report.

Here's a breakdown of how pivot tables work and why they are useful:

### Summarize Data
Pivot tables enable users to quickly compute statistical summaries such as sums, averages, counts, and standard deviations without writing complex formulas. For instance, if you have a sales dataset, you can easily calculate the total sales per region or the average sales per product.

### Reorganize Data
You can "pivot" or rotate the data to view it from different perspectives. By dragging and dropping fields within the pivot table, you can change the way data is grouped and viewed. For example, you can switch from seeing sales data by month to seeing it by salesperson with a few clicks.

### Filter Data
Pivot tables often include filtering options that let you display only the data that meets certain criteria. You can focus on specific rows or columns, or apply filters to multiple layers within your data.

### Create Crosstab Reports
Pivot tables are excellent for creating crosstab reports, which are used to display the relationship between two or more fields. For example, you can create a two-dimensional table that shows how different salespeople performed across multiple products.

### Drill-down Capability
Many pivot tables allow you to get more detailed information about any of the summary data. For instance, if youâ€™re looking at total quarterly sales and you want to see the transactions that make up the total, you can often click to expand the view.

### No Impact on Original Data
When you create a pivot table, you aren't editing or reorganizing your original dataset. The pivot table is essentially a dynamic summary report generated from the underlying data, which remains intact.

### Components of a Pivot Table
- **Fields**: The columns from your dataset that you want to include in your pivot table.
- **Rows**: The vertical side of the table which often shows the items that you want to summarize.
- **Columns**: The horizontal part of the table which could also show summarized items, often used to compare.
- **Values**: The actual numbers that are being summarized, which can be aggregated in various ways like sum, count, average, etc.

To create a pivot table, you generally select the range of data you want to analyze, choose the "Pivot Table" option from the relevant menu in your spreadsheet software, and then configure the fields for rows, columns, and values as needed for your specific analysis.

What format of input data is good for a pivot table?

To ensure a pivot table works effectively, the input data should be organized in a specific way. Here's how you should format the input data for a pivot table:

### Tabular Format

The data should be in a table format with rows and columns, where:

- **Each row contains a record**: A record is a complete set of related data points (for example, all the information pertaining to one sale or one customer).
- **Each column contains a specific attribute**: Attributes should be consistent throughout the column (e.g., a "Sales Amount" column should not contain dates or names).
- **Headers at the top**: Each column should have a unique header which describes the data in that column.

### Consistent Data Types

- **No mixed types in a single column**: Each column should contain the same type of data (numbers, dates, text, etc.).
- **Numeric values for calculations**: For columns that you want to summarize (e.g., to calculate sums or averages), the data should be numeric.
- **Dates in date format**: If you plan to analyze data based on dates, ensure that the date columns are in a recognized date format so the pivot table can group the dates correctly.

### Avoiding Blank Cells and Errors

- **No blank rows or columns**: The dataset should not have completely empty rows or columns, as this can confuse the pivot table range.
- **Minimize blank cells within the data**: If some data points are missing, it's often better to have a placeholder such as "N/A" or "0" (if appropriate) rather than a blank cell.
- **No errors**: Try to resolve any error values in cells (like `#DIV/0!` or `#N/A`) because they can interfere with calculations and summaries.

### No Subtotals or Totals

- **Do not include subtotals or grand totals** from the original data set in the pivot table range, as pivot tables calculate their own subtotals and grand totals.

### Single Row of Headers

- **One header row**: Only one row should be used for headers; do not use multiple rows.

### No Merging Cells

- **Avoid merged cells**: Merged cells can cause issues with pivot tables, so it's best to unmerge any cells before attempting to create a pivot table.

### Example of Well-Formatted Data:

```
+--------+------------+----------+-------------+
| Date   | Salesperson| Product  | Sales Amount|
+--------+------------+----------+-------------+
| Jan-01 | John Doe   | Widget A | $500        |
| Jan-01 | Jane Smith | Widget B | $700        |
| Jan-02 | John Doe   | Widget A | $800        |
| Jan-02 | Jane Smith | Widget C | $650        |
| ...    | ...        | ...      | ...         |
+--------+------------+----------+-------------+
```

In this example, each row is a record of a sale, and the columns represent the date of the sale, the salesperson, the product sold, and the sales amount. This data is ready to be used in a pivot table, allowing you to analyze sales by date, salesperson, product, or any combination thereof.
