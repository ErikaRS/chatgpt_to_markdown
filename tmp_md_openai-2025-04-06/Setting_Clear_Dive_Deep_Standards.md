When I ask leaders to apply the dive deep leadership principle from Amazon, I sometimes get pushed back that I am asking them to micromanage them. This pushback makes it hard to performance manage people who have been asked to dive deep, even when given tools about what that means. They treat it as a a philosophical debate rather than a set of practices they could learn and utilize. In this sort of situation. How can I, as a leader, set clear objective standards of what I want managers do and demonstrate and practice? The goal is to be able to define outcomes rather than outputs, so that if they continue to refuse to dive deep, I can point to clear expectations that they either have or have not met and use those as markers of their overall performance.

To address the pushback and set clear, objective standards for the 'dive deep' leadership principle, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Define Clear Expectations and Outcomes
- **Specific Metrics**: Establish specific metrics and KPIs that align with the 'dive deep' principle. These could include:
  - Frequency and quality of in-depth analysis reports.
  - Number of critical insights or improvements identified through deep dives.
  - Timely resolution of complex issues uncovered during deep dives.

### 2. Provide Clear Guidelines and Training
- **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation outlining what 'dive deep' means in your context, including examples of good practices and expected behaviors.
- **Training Programs**: Offer training sessions to educate managers on how to effectively dive deep without crossing into micromanagement.

2. **Expected Behaviors**:
   - Conduct monthly in-depth reviews of key processes.
   - Identify at least three actionable insights or areas for improvement per quarter.
   - Implement changes based on insights and track their impact.
3. **Outcomes**:
   - Demonstrated improvements in process efficiency.
   - Measurable positive impact on team performance and output.
   - Evidence of proactive problem-solving and strategic thinking.

By defining these clear, objective standards and consistently communicating the value and expectations, you can help managers understand the importance of the 'dive deep' principle and how it contributes to their performance evaluation.

These are good and actionable, but how can I get at the fact that when I am asking them to deep dive, they think that I am asking them to micromanage? A lot of these things here will feel like me asking them to micromanage more and so likely will not go over well.

To address the perception that 'dive deep' equates to micromanagement, it's essential to emphasize the distinction between the two and foster an environment where deep dives are seen as a strategic necessity rather than a control mechanism. Here are some specific strategies to achieve this:

### 1. Emphasize Strategic Insight Over Control
- **Clarify Intent**: Clearly communicate that the purpose of diving deep is to gain strategic insights and understand the root causes of issues, not to control day-to-day tasks.
- **Focus on Analysis**: Emphasize that diving deep involves analyzing data, identifying trends, and understanding underlying problems rather than managing every detail.

### 2. Empower Managers to Take Ownership
- **Autonomy in Execution**: Encourage managers to take ownership of the insights gained from deep dives and implement solutions independently. This empowers them and reduces the feeling of micromanagement.
- **Decision-Making Authority**: Grant managers the authority to make decisions based on their deep dive findings, reinforcing trust and autonomy.

### 3. Differentiate Between Deep Diving and Micromanaging
- **Role Definitions**: Provide clear definitions and examples distinguishing deep diving from micromanaging. For instance:
  - **Deep Diving**: Analyzing customer feedback to identify product improvement areas.
  - **Micromanaging**: Telling team members exactly how to handle each piece of customer feedback.
- **Educational Sessions**: Hold workshops or training sessions to educate managers on the difference, using real-life examples and scenarios.

### 4. Create a Supportive Culture
- **Open Dialogue**: Foster a culture of open dialogue where managers feel comfortable discussing their concerns about micromanagement. Address these concerns transparently.
- **Peer Learning**: Encourage managers who successfully apply the 'dive deep' principle to share their experiences and strategies with peers, highlighting the benefits and addressing misconceptions.

### 5. Set Boundaries and Expectations
- **Clear Boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries for when and how deep dives should be conducted. For example, specify that deep dives should focus on systemic issues rather than individual performance.
- **Guidelines for Action**: Provide guidelines on translating deep dive findings into actionable strategies without micromanaging. Emphasize the importance of collaboration and team input in these strategies.

### 6. Highlight Positive Examples
- **Case Studies**: Share case studies where deep dives led to significant improvements without resulting in micromanagement. Highlight how these efforts contributed to overall success.
- **Recognition and Rewards**: Recognize and reward managers who effectively balance deep dives with autonomy, showcasing them as role models.

### Example Communication to Managers:
"**Our goal with the 'dive deep' principle is to enhance our strategic understanding and improve our processes, not to control every detail of our team's work. Deep diving means asking the right questions, analyzing data, and identifying opportunities for improvement. Itâ€™s about empowering you to make informed decisions and drive meaningful change. We trust you to use these insights to lead your teams effectively and independently.**"

### Practical Exercise:
**Scenario Analysis**: Conduct a scenario analysis exercise where managers are given a problem to solve using deep dive techniques. After the exercise, discuss how they can implement solutions without micromanaging, emphasizing strategic thinking and delegation.

By implementing these strategies, you can help shift the perception of 'dive deep' from micromanagement to a valuable leadership practice that enhances strategic decision-making and empowers managers.

Finally, how do I performance manage someone who absolutely refuses to dive deep? , hard to refute case that this is part of their role requirements and that they are not meeting those expectations?

### Assistant - 2024-07-14 10:12:12

Performance managing someone who refuses to dive deep requires a structured approach that clearly links this behavior to their role requirements and overall performance expectations. Here are steps to address this situation effectively:

### 1. Establish Clear Role Requirements
- **Job Description**: Ensure the job description explicitly includes the requirement to dive deep as part of their responsibilities. This provides a formal basis for evaluating their performance.
- **Performance Criteria**: Define specific performance criteria related to diving deep. For example, "Conducting thorough analysis to identify root causes of issues and proposing actionable solutions."

### 2. Set Specific Expectations and Goals
- **SMART Goals**: Set Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals related to deep diving. For instance:
  - "Analyze monthly sales data to identify at least three actionable insights by the end of each quarter."
  - "Conduct a deep dive into customer feedback and present findings and recommendations in the monthly team meeting."
- **Documentation**: Document these goals and review them regularly to ensure they are clear and understood.

### 3. Provide Support and Resources
- **Training**: Offer training and resources to help the individual develop the necessary skills for deep diving.
- **Mentorship**: Pair them with a mentor who excels at diving deep and can provide guidance and support.

### 4. Monitor Progress and Provide Feedback
- **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular check-ins to discuss their progress on deep dive activities. Use these sessions to provide constructive feedback and identify any barriers they may be facing.
- **Feedback Loop**: Create a feedback loop where they can share their concerns and you can address them promptly.

### 5. Document Performance Issues
- **Record Keeping**: Keep detailed records of instances where the individual has failed to meet the deep dive expectations. This includes dates, specific tasks, and the impact of their failure to dive deep.
- **Performance Reviews**: Include these documented instances in their formal performance reviews. Highlight how their refusal to dive deep is impacting their overall performance and the team's success.

### 6. Implement a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
- **PIP Development**: If the individual continues to refuse to dive deep, develop a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) that outlines specific actions they need to take to meet the deep dive requirements.
- **Clear Consequences**: Clearly communicate the consequences of not meeting the PIP objectives, such as further disciplinary action or potential termination.

### 7. Communicate the Importance and Expectations
- **Role Clarity**: Reiterate the importance of diving deep in their role and how it aligns with the organization's goals and objectives.
- **Impact on Team and Organization**: Explain the impact of their refusal to dive deep on the team's performance and the broader organization.

### Example Communication for PIP:
"**As part of your role, it is essential to engage in deep dives to identify root causes of issues and propose actionable solutions. This expectation has been clearly communicated in your job description and performance goals. Despite our discussions and the support provided, you have not met these expectations. To address this, we are implementing a Performance Improvement Plan with the following objectives: [list specific goals and actions]. Failure to meet these objectives may result in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination. We are committed to supporting you in meeting these expectations and achieving success in your role.**"

### Final Steps:
- **Follow-Up**: Conduct regular follow-up meetings to review progress against the PIP and provide additional support as needed.
- **Evaluate Outcomes**: At the end of the PIP period, evaluate whether the individual has met the expectations. If they have, acknowledge their progress. If they have not, proceed with the outlined consequences.

By following these steps, you can create a clear, objective case that diving deep is an integral part of the role and manage performance accordingly if the individual continues to refuse to meet these expectations.
