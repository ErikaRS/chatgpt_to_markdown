Certainly! Here's a collection of unconventional or less often cited ideas about leading in times of change:

1. **Trust your gut**: Sometimes, intuition provides answers data can't.
 
2. **Celebrate nostalgia**: Embrace and acknowledge the good from the past as you move forward.

3. **Accept the unexpected**: The best plans will have their hiccups; it's okay.

4. **Use humor**: A well-timed joke can relieve tension and make the transition smoother.

5. **Listen to outsiders**: Sometimes those not deeply entrenched in the system see things more clearly.

6. **Embrace mistakes**: They're inevitable. Use them as learning experiences instead of sources of blame.

7. **Value emotional intelligence**: Numbers aren’t everything. Understanding and managing emotions is crucial during change.

8. **Be a storyteller**: Narratives can inspire, connect, and guide people in ways that data and directives can't.

9. **Sometimes, follow**: Recognize moments when it’s best to step back and let someone else take the lead.

10. **Stay humble**: No matter how great a leader you are, change is bigger than any one individual.

11. **Get physical**: Physical activity can be a great stress-reliever. Encourage your team to take breaks and move around.

12. **Artistic outlets**: Encourage creative expression. Painting or music sessions can help people process change.

13. **Check in often**: Not just about work, but about how your team feels. Their well-being matters.

14. **Stay curious**: Even in chaos, there's always something new to learn.

15. **Let go of perfection**: Aim for progress, not perfection.

16. **Encourage downtime**: Rest is essential for resilience and adaptability.

17. **Seek feedback from all levels**: From the intern to the executive, everyone's perspective is valuable.

18. **Space for reflection**: Give your team moments of pause to think and introspect.

19. **Admit when you're lost**: Sometimes saying "I don’t know" is the most honest and helpful answer.

20. **Focus on shared humanity**: Remind everyone of the commonalities that bind them together.

21. **Don’t fear the silence**: In meetings and discussions, sometimes moments of silence can lead to the most profound insights.

These aren't typical bullet points from business articles, but they highlight the human aspect of leadership, especially during times of change.

How might one use artistic outlets with a team of software engineers, people who on average feel less in touch with their artistic side?

Introducing artistic outlets to software engineers can be both refreshing and beneficial for their well-being and creativity. Here's how one might integrate artistic elements into the work of a team that doesn't usually engage in such activities:

1. **Doodle Sessions**: Start meetings with a 5-minute doodle on a given topic. It can act as a warm-up and may even lead to innovative visual solutions.

2. **Coding as Art**: Organize code poetry or code art competitions. They can express creativity using the languages and tools they're most comfortable with.

3. **Music Breaks**: Designate a day where team members share their favorite songs or music. It's a way of sharing and understanding each other's tastes and can foster bonding.

4. **Photography Challenges**: Give them a theme (like "patterns" or "color contrasts") and let them capture photos. It encourages them to observe their environment differently.

5. **Storytelling**: Have sessions where they narrate a story – either real, fictional, or related to their coding journey.

6. **VR or AR Art**: If they're into virtual or augmented reality, they can explore creating art in a 3D space.

7. **Lego Building**: Legos can be both fun and a great way to visually and tangibly express ideas.

8. **Mindful Coloring**: Offer coloring books or pages during breaks. It’s known to relieve stress.

9. **Artistic Workshops**: Occasionally bring in an artist to conduct a workshop, be it in painting, sketching, or any other art form. A beginner-friendly environment can make it more accessible.

10. **Game Design**: Organize a mini game jam. Designing a game requires both technical and artistic skills.

11. **Digital Art Tools**: Introduce them to simple digital art tools or software where they can play around and create something visually appealing.

12. **Interactive Art Installations**: Encourage creating interactive art, maybe even something that can be displayed in the office.

13. **Film Nights**: Host movie nights with artistically acclaimed films. Discussing them can be a way of appreciating the art of filmmaking.

14. **Theater Plays or Improv**: Organize trips to plays or bring in an improv group for a workshop. Improv especially can boost spontaneous problem-solving skills.

15. **Art Inspired Hackathons**: The themes of hackathons can be inspired by various art forms or artists.

Remember, the goal isn't to make them artists but to provide avenues to explore creativity, reduce stress, and build team cohesion. The hope is that by engaging in these activities, even the most analytical minds will find renewed inspiration and a broader perspective on problem-solving.
