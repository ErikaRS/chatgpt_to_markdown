What you're describing sounds like a **"consent-based"** or **"consultative"** decision-making model. In this model, the decision maker seeks input, commentary, and feedback from stakeholders or team members, but doesn't require unanimous agreement to move forward. Instead, it's about ensuring everyone has been heard, addressing concerns, and making an informed decision with their input considered.

This approach is often referred to as **"consent over consensus"** or **"consult and decide"**. It emphasizes gathering perspectives and ensuring that any strong objections are heard and addressed, but ultimately the decision can proceed even without total consensus. This model strikes a balance between efficiency and inclusivity, ensuring that decisions are well-informed without requiring full alignment from all parties.
