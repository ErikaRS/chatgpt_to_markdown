Below are questions for an interview for an Engineering Manager over a Product Platform team. The Product Platform team covers ingesting and serving source code, indexing and serving code for search, and extracting code graph structure from the code. The team consists of 3 subteams of 3 people each. 

Please critique the questions below for their effectiveness in evaluating if a candidate would be a good manager for the team. Assume that there are two interviewers who are members of the team.

[5m] Brief intro and purpose of interview
[1] Describe a project which demonstrates your experience with one or more of distributed systems, search and indexing, or compilers and language tools. What was one big technical challenge in this project? What were the options that you considered? How did you solve the problem? Why that solution? (Dig in deep on this one.)
Great answer: Candidate has hands-on experience with at least one of these technologies. They can talk about challenges in a way that shows their understanding. They can make tradeoffs and explain why.
Insufficient answer: Answer demonstrates shallow experience or understanding. They have the experience but they can’t speak to options and tradeoffs. 
[2] Tell us about a time your team wanted to push back against requirements as initially given to the team. What was your role in the process? What did you delegate to the team? What were the final tradeoffs?
Great answer: The candidate is able to find an example with legitimate trade-offs. They can explain the technical scope of the request and why the team pushed back. The candidate understands both the team and client’s perspective and helps the team find a good balance. They drive a final decision. The candidate delegates work to the team.
Insufficient answer: The trade-off has an obvious answer. The candidate does not explain the technical problem clearly. The candidate was not able to resolve the problem. They did not have an effective approach to delegation, either not delegating enough or delegating too much. 
[3] How would you design…
TODO: Source system design question plus potential follow-ups from the team
Great answer: Details TBD. Candidate produces a design that solves the problem at hand and is able to explain it clearly and make tradeoffs. 
Insufficient answer: TBD. Candidate doesn’t have the knowledge to produce an effective design. They explain it badly. 
[4] Tell me about someone who you are proud of and whom you helped grow in their career. How did they grow and what did you do to facilitate that growth?
Great answer: Candidate takes people management seriously. They have concrete skills they have applied to helping people grow.
Insufficient answer: No concrete example or example doesn’t feel significant. Candidate used techniques which do not seem like a good fit for our culture.
[5] What approach would you take if you were asked to improve Sourcegraph’s technical platform? How would you figure out what projects to invest in?
Great answer: TC asks questions about what is important to the customer / company / team. They can propose a way of measuring the improvement. They ask questions that start to get some of the real challenges we face (e.g., legacy systems).
Insufficient answer: Answer is overly generic. Candidate assumes an answer without probing for more detail. Candidate doesn’t ask questions. Candidate doesn’t think about how to measure improvement.

The set of questions you've provided for the Engineering Manager interview for a Product Platform team is comprehensive and focused on both technical and people management aspects. Here's a critique of each question:

1. **Technical Project Experience**: This is an excellent foundational question. It not only allows the candidate to showcase their technical depth but also gives insight into their problem-solving approach and ability to make tradeoffs. Your differentiation between great and insufficient answers is on point.

2. **Pushback Against Requirements**: This question is crucial as it touches upon the dynamics of communication and negotiation between teams, and how an engineering manager facilitates these. It showcases a candidate's leadership, collaboration skills, and their ability to handle challenges. Your criteria for evaluation are well thought out.

3. **Design Question**: It seems you have a placeholder here. Make sure the design question you ask is pertinent to the work the team does, yet challenging enough to gauge the candidate's depth of understanding. Additionally, be explicit in what you're looking for in terms of scalability, reliability, maintainability, and any other relevant criteria for a good design. Once the specifics of the question are decided, the criteria for great and insufficient answers can be more defined.

4. **People Management**: This question is very important for a managerial role. Not only does it evaluate if the candidate has mentored or led someone, but it also checks if they take pride in the growth of their team members. The criteria for evaluation effectively distinguish between someone who is hands-on in people management and someone who might not prioritize it.

5. **Improving Sourcegraph’s Technical Platform**: This is an excellent open-ended question that gauges how the candidate would approach platform improvement from a high-level perspective. It tests their strategic thinking, their inquisitiveness, and their problem-solving approach. The criteria for evaluation are clear, but it might also be beneficial to see if the candidate can prioritize based on impact and feasibility.

**Additional Considerations**:

- **Cultural Fit**: It might be beneficial to have a question related to company culture or values, e.g., "Tell us about a time when you had to make a decision that was right for your team or company but might have been unpopular. How did you handle it and what was the outcome?" This can give insights into how well the candidate might fit into the organizational culture.

- **Handling Conflicts**: Consider a question like, "Describe a time when there was a significant conflict within your team. How did you resolve it?" This can help in understanding their conflict resolution and team management skills.

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Another important aspect for any manager is giving and receiving feedback. A potential question could be, "How do you give feedback to a team member who isn't meeting expectations? Can you provide an example?"

- **Time Management**: Given the manager will be overseeing multiple sub-teams, it might be worth asking, "How do you prioritize tasks or projects when managing multiple teams? Can you provide an example?"

**Conclusion**:
The structure of your interview seems well thought out, covering both technical and managerial aspects of the role. Ensure that the questions remain open-ended enough to allow for diverse answers, and pay attention to how candidates think and approach problems as much as the actual solutions they provide.
