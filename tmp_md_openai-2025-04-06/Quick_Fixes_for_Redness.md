I have literally 5 minutes to look like I haven't been crying. I've already washed my face in cold water and dried it. I am wearing glasses. What else can I do?

You can try a few quick fixes to look more refreshed:

1. **Eye Drops**: Use lubricating eye drops to reduce redness and soothe your eyes.
2. **Cold Compress**: Apply a cold compress or chilled, damp cloth over your eyes for a couple of minutes. The cold can help reduce swelling and redness.
3. **Hydrate**: Drink a glass of water to help hydrate your skin and reduce puffiness.
4. **Moisturize**: Apply a light moisturizer to your face to hydrate and refresh your skin. If you have an eye cream, especially one with caffeine, use it under your eyes to help with puffiness.
5. **Concealer**: If you have concealer, you can lightly apply it under your eyes and around any red areas to even out your skin tone.
6. **Breathe Deeply**: Take a few deep breaths to help calm yourself. It can also help reduce redness.
7. **Wear Bright or Natural Lip Color**: If it's appropriate for where you're going, applying a natural or bright lip color can help draw attention away from your eyes.
8. **Adjust Your Glasses**: Make sure your glasses are clean and positioned to help conceal any puffiness or redness around your eyes.

Remember, your emotions are valid, and taking these steps is just a way to help you feel more comfortable and confident in the moment.
