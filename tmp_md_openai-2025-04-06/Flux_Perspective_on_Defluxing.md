While "defluxing" isn't explicitly discussed in the FLUX Review, let's break it down based on the principles that are central to systems thinking and how FLUX applies these ideas.

### Flux Perspective on "Defluxing"
"Defluxing," as a conceptual term, could imply stripping down or unpacking complex systems-thinking frameworks into more accessible or mainstream ideas. A "flux" perspective might support this as a subtle form of introducing broader systems change without overwhelming audiences with complex jargon or abstract models upfront.

#### **Smuggling Systems Thinking**
The FLUX Review often discusses the idea of *stealth integration*, where big ideas are introduced in seemingly smaller, more digestible forms. By focusing on tangible examples, lived experiences, or current pain points, you can introduce systems thinking without the overt framing of it as such. This aligns with the idea of "defluxing" — strategically embedding systemic principles into everyday discussions and challenges. 

For instance, consider starting with common organizational challenges like inefficiency or communication breakdowns, but approaching solutions through a systems lens — recognizing feedback loops, interconnected dependencies, or emergent behaviors. The language used here is crucial: instead of introducing complex terms like "causal loops" or "emergence," you could talk about the visible "ripple effects" or "hidden patterns" that shape these issues.

#### **Mainstream Accessibility**
A FLUX approach would emphasize breaking down high-level systems ideas into actions people can see and relate to — thus increasing mainstream engagement with systems thinking. Instead of "systems mapping," it could be reframed as "connecting the dots between issues," or instead of "complexity," you could talk about "how things aren't as simple as they seem."

FLUX often calls for ways to adapt, borrow, and remix ideas into smaller, more practical chunks. "Defluxing" could be seen as another example of this form of agile, adaptive thinking — using small steps to make bigger, systems-based change over time.

While the newsletter doesn't explicitly use the term "defluxing," it certainly encourages ways to sneak big, transformative ideas into the mainstream in ways that don’t feel forced or overwhelming.

### Characteristics of a FLUX Style Essay

A FLUX style essay embodies certain unique characteristics rooted in systems thinking, pattern recognition, and adaptive frameworks:

1. **Systems Lens**: The essay uses a systems-based approach, looking at interconnectedness and relationships between ideas, avoiding linear or overly simplistic views.
   
2. **Emergence & Complexity**: It emphasizes how small elements come together to create emergent properties, focusing on complexity rather than reductionism.

3. **Interdisciplinary Insights**: A FLUX essay borrows from multiple fields, weaving them together to form a cohesive narrative. It may pull insights from organizational theory, biology, technology, or art to illuminate new patterns.

4. **Dynamic Language**: The tone is fluid and evolving, reflecting the changing nature of the topics. Metaphors, analogies, and unconventional comparisons are often used to capture complex, dynamic ideas.

5. **Reframing & Paradigm Shifts**: Rather than just stating facts or observations, a FLUX essay invites the reader to reconsider assumptions and frames of reference. It seeks to change how people think about problems.

6. **Practical yet Thought-Provoking**: While it explores deep theoretical concepts, the essay also gives practical takeaways or actionable insights. It balances intellectual depth with real-world relevance.

7. **Iterative Thought**: The essay doesn't offer a single, static conclusion but instead promotes iterative thinking. It may revisit the same idea in different contexts, showing how it changes or adapts.

### "Defluxing: A Quiet Revolution in Systems Thinking"

In a world shaped by interconnectedness, why does systems thinking still feel like an outsider? The answer may lie not in the complexity of the ideas but in how we introduce them. Enter "defluxing" — a stealthy, almost insurgent approach to smuggling the transformative power of systems thinking into the mainstream. 

But what does it mean to "deflux" an idea?

Defluxing is about taking the grand, often abstract concepts central to systems theory and breaking them down into their simplest, most relatable forms. Instead of overwhelming people with intricate feedback loops or emergent properties, defluxing gently introduces these concepts through accessible language and familiar narratives. It recognizes that systems thinking, with its multi-layered views and complex interdependencies, can be hard to digest, especially when competing with the linear models that dominate everyday conversations.

So, why should we care about defluxing? Because it’s the key to making systems thinking not just palatable, but actionable. By defluxing, we avoid overwhelming those new to the ideas with technical terms, instead speaking in terms of visible effects and everyday experiences. The butterfly effect? Talk about how a small decision ripples through an organization. Emergence? Frame it as how different team members' inputs lead to unexpected solutions. You’re not diluting the idea — you’re simply making it accessible.

Defluxing is, at its core, a systems approach to communication. It understands that ideas live in ecosystems too — and they need to be introduced in the right conditions to take root. By taking the expansive and narrowing it down, we increase the chance for those seeds to grow in places we’d never expect.

This shift to defluxing follows a pattern familiar to systems thinkers: the need to iterate, adapt, and remix. A central principle of the FLUX Review is that ideas shouldn’t stay in their original, complex form forever. They need to evolve, to shape-shift in ways that allow for wider adoption and utility. Defluxing is the stealth mode for systems thinkers — engaging the world one practical, intuitive insight at a time.

At its heart, defluxing isn’t about watering down. It’s about meeting the mainstream where it is and guiding it, step by step, into the world of systems. Through defluxing, the complexity of our interconnected world becomes not just a theoretical discussion, but a lived experience that anyone can see, feel, and influence.

Defluxing doesn’t erase the power of systems thinking; it amplifies it by making it accessible, actionable, and inevitable. In every ripple, in every small change, we can see the echoes of bigger systems at work. It’s time we make systems thinking as ubiquitous as the problems it seeks to address — and defluxing is how we get there. 

### Closing Thoughts

In the end, defluxing isn't about simplifying ideas; it’s about building pathways. It’s a systems approach to bringing systems thinking into the mainstream — not through force, but through resonance. Each small insight, carefully framed, can lead to a larger paradigm shift, allowing systems thinking to evolve into the everyday language of change. And in that shift, we move from theory to practice, from the edge to the center. 

The revolution will be defluxed.
