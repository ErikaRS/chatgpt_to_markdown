LuLaRoe, the leggings and apparel company often accused of being a pyramid scheme, faced significant legal challenges over the past few years. The company was embroiled in a lawsuit with the state of Washington, which accused LuLaRoe of operating a pyramid scheme that misled thousands of people about the profitability of becoming independent consultants. This lawsuit was settled in February 2021, with LuLaRoe agreeing to pay $4.75 million. The settlement included $4 million earmarked for restitution to those who lost money through the scheme【6†source】【7†source】.

Despite these legal issues, LuLaRoe is still in business. The company continues to operate and recruit new salespeople. As part of the settlement, LuLaRoe has been required to implement changes to increase transparency and fairness in its business practices, including publishing an income disclosure statement to clarify the earning potential and associated risks for independent consultants【6†source】【7†source】.
