Make this more concise: Commitment Cadence: EPD will keep GTM informed of upcoming changes making it clear which ones are strong commitments with dates. Commitments will only apply to high confidence work, even if that means that the set of strong commitments is smaller than the set of “must have” items from a Product and Marketing perspective. Commitments should be provided as far in advance as the confidence warrants but at least X weeks before rolling out to customers to leave time for GTM to make any adjustments needed.

Commitment Cadence: EPD will update GTM on future changes, specifying which are firm commitments with dates. Only high-confidence work will be committed to, potentially reducing the number of strong commitments compared to the "must have" list from Product and Marketing. Commitments will be made as early as confidence allows, but no later than X weeks before customer rollout, ensuring GTM has time for necessary adjustments.

What's an alternative to "centrally planned" in this example? Centrally planned, in our context, has taken on a pejorative tone, and I want to avoid evoking that: Centrally planned work will focus, focusing on delivering high-impact theme-based features for our marketing moments.
