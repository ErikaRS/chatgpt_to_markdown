Working in teams can be enhanced through various lenses and approaches:

1. **Effective Team Structure**: According to "Collaborative Intelligence: Using Teams to Solve Hard Problems" by J. Richard Hackman, effective teams are those that are intact social systems working together for a common purpose. They require a compelling purpose, the right number and mix of people, clear norms, organizational support, and effective coaching. This structured approach to team building can be particularly insightful for creating cohesive and high-functioning teams【15†source】.

2. **Beyond Traditional Team Models**: It's important to recognize that collaborative teams and individual genius are not the only models for group work. Effective structures may also include groups working independently on composable parts. Interestingly, interpersonal harmony often follows high performance rather than causing it, suggesting that coaching for performance may be more effective than focusing primarily on interpersonal dynamics. Additionally, individually focused incentives can be detrimental to team-based work, and sometimes less (in terms of resources and team size) can be more effective than more【16†source】.

3. **Balance of Attention and Awareness**: In team dynamics, attention and awareness are closely linked, much like in meditation. A team with "tunnel vision" that adopts a broader perspective might lose some of its intense focus, while teams that are more dispersed in their attention ("distracted prophets") may struggle to prioritize effectively. Balancing these elements is key. A useful heuristic is to observe how many people in an organization are working on diffuse sensing (awareness) versus aligned focus (attention) and how they manage these aspects【17†source】.

These lenses provide a multifaceted view of team dynamics, suggesting that successful teamwork is about finding the right balance between structure, flexibility, focus, and awareness. Each team may require a different blend of these elements depending on its unique context and objectives.
