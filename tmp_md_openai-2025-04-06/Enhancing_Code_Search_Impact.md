I am writing an update for a board meeting for a tech company. Critique this statement for clarity of goals and business impact and for "pizazz". Provide suggestions on improvements. 

Code Search
- Complete engineering work for the Feb Code Search release. Our topline goal is to increase stickiness within existing customers. Key metric: DAU
- Supporting operational efficiency by reducing cost to run the open source Code Search instance

Your statement for the board meeting update has a clear structure and identifies key objectives and metrics, but it could benefit from a few enhancements for clarity, impact, and engagement. Here are some critiques and suggestions:

1. **Clarify 'Stickiness' and DAU**: The term "stickiness" might be too vague for some board members. Specify what "increasing stickiness" means in this context. Does it refer to more frequent use, longer session durations, or something else? Also, define DAU (Daily Active Users) briefly to ensure everyone understands the metric.

2. **Highlight User Benefits**: Instead of just stating the goal, briefly describe how the Feb Code Search release will improve the user experience or add value for the customers. This makes the objective more relatable and impactful.

3. **Quantify Improvements**: If possible, provide an estimate of the expected increase in DAU or other quantifiable improvements. This gives a concrete target for the board to look forward to.

4. **Detail Operational Efficiency**: Explain briefly how reducing the cost to run the open-source Code Search instance will lead to operational efficiency. Will it free up resources for other projects, improve scalability, or enhance performance?

5. **Add Pizazz**: Use more engaging language to make the statement more memorable. For example, instead of "complete engineering work," you might say "we're poised to finalize our innovative engineering solutions for the Feb Code Search release."

6. **Visual Element**: Consider adding a slide or graphic that visually represents the expected impact of these initiatives, like a graph showing the projected increase in DAU or cost savings.

7. **Success Stories or Testimonials**: If available, briefly mention a customer testimonial or a success story related to Code Search. This adds credibility and makes the impact more tangible.

Revised Statement:
"We're poised to finalize our innovative engineering solutions for the upcoming Feb Code Search release, aiming to significantly enhance user engagement and daily interactions (DAU). Our focused strategy is not just to retain our existing customer base but to deepen their engagement with our platform, ensuring they derive more value with each session. Simultaneously, we're championing operational excellence by strategically reducing the running costs of our open-source Code Search instance. This move is set to not only boost our efficiency but also redirect valuable resources towards further groundbreaking developments. We anticipate these initiatives will set a new benchmark in user experience and operational agility."

This revised statement is more engaging, provides clearer goals, and better communicates the business impact.

Rephrase this bit with more pizazz than original but less pizazz than the revision above "Complete engineering work for the Feb Code Search release."

"Finalize the innovative engineering phase for our February Code Search release."
