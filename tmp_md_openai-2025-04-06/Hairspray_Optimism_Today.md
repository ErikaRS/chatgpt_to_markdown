How pessimistic is it of me to think that the movie / musical Hairspray is too optimistic to have a similar thing made today in a post-Trump presidency, post-black lives matter movement are?

It’s not overly pessimistic; it’s a realistic observation that reflects how much has shifted culturally and politically since *Hairspray* was originally made. The movie’s optimism stems from a certain narrative of progress and unity that felt achievable at the time it was set and produced. *Hairspray* celebrates integration, individual acceptance, and social change in a way that, while hopeful, is undeniably simplified compared to the complexities we face today. 

In a post-Trump presidency, post-BLM world, it’s harder for audiences to accept a story that resolves deeply rooted social issues with relatively quick solutions. Nowadays, people tend to expect narratives that acknowledge deeper, systemic challenges and explore more of the ongoing struggles without suggesting a single, clear-cut solution. While the core message of inclusivity and acceptance remains relevant, today’s viewers might feel a more direct need for the story to acknowledge the still-unresolved racial and social issues, creating a version of *Hairspray* that’s perhaps a bit less cleanly optimistic, and more realistically complicated. 

It’s worth noting, though, that *Hairspray*’s core optimism about change can still be refreshing, especially when used to inspire action. Just perhaps with a more nuanced approach than before.
