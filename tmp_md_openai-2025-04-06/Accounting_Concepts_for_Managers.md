Here's a statement I read. Educate me on these things: So even the executive far removed from any work in accounting, such as a research manager in a development laboratory, needs to understand the basic theory and concepts represented by these changes in accounting. These new concepts and tools include: activity-based costing, price-led costing, economic-chain costing, economic value added, and benchmarking.

Let’s break this down so you can get a solid understanding of each concept mentioned. At the end of this, I’ll also provide some context on how executives in non-accounting roles might use these ideas effectively.

### 1. **Activity-Based Costing (ABC)**
   - **Definition:** A costing method that identifies activities within an organization and assigns costs to products or services based on their actual consumption of these activities.
   - **Why it matters:** Unlike traditional costing, which spreads costs evenly or assigns them based on labor hours, ABC gives a more accurate picture of how much specific products or services truly cost.
   - **Example in action:** In a research lab, ABC could help determine which experiments or projects consume the most resources, allowing better budgeting and prioritization.

### 2. **Price-Led Costing**
   - **Definition:** A pricing approach where the market price determines the allowable cost of a product. The business then works backward to design the product within that cost constraint.
   - **Why it matters:** Forces companies to innovate and optimize production processes to stay competitive.
   - **Example in action:** A lab manager may need to oversee cost reduction for a product to meet market expectations without compromising quality.

### 3. **Economic-Chain Costing**
   - **Definition:** A methodology that analyzes the costs and value generated across the entire value chain, from suppliers to customers.
   - **Why it matters:** It ensures that decisions are made with a holistic understanding of the costs and benefits across the entire supply chain, not just in isolated departments.
   - **Example in action:** A development lab might collaborate with suppliers and manufacturing to streamline materials sourcing for prototypes, reducing total production costs.

### 4. **Economic Value Added (EVA)**
   - **Definition:** A measure of a company’s financial performance based on residual wealth, calculated as net operating profit after taxes minus the cost of capital.
   - **Why it matters:** Helps evaluate whether a project or department is truly adding value to the organization beyond covering its costs.
   - **Example in action:** A research manager could use EVA to justify continued investment in long-term innovation projects by showing how they create value over time.

### 5. **Benchmarking**
   - **Definition:** A process of comparing your organization’s processes, performance metrics, and practices against those of leading organizations in the same industry.
   - **Why it matters:** It highlights areas for improvement by learning from others' successes.
   - **Example in action:** A development laboratory might benchmark its R&D efficiency or innovation rate against industry leaders to identify best practices.

### Why Non-Accounting Executives Should Care
Even if you're not in accounting, understanding these concepts is crucial for:
- **Strategic Decision-Making:** Ensuring that projects are cost-effective and aligned with financial goals.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Communicating with finance and accounting teams effectively.
- **Resource Allocation:** Prioritizing projects or initiatives based on accurate costing and value-creation metrics.

### Building Trust and Connection
If you're discussing these topics with peers or subordinates:
- **Peers:** Share practical examples of how you’ve seen these tools improve decision-making in other contexts.
- **Subordinates:** Offer to explain these ideas in layman's terms to empower their understanding.
- **Experts:** Be curious and ask accountants or financial analysts how they apply these tools in your organization. It builds respect and helps you learn from them.

Would you like deeper insights into any of these tools or practical steps to start integrating them into your decision-making?

### Assistant - 2024-12-04 18:19:56

Here’s how each of these concepts applies to a **head of software engineering**, using practical examples from your role:

---

### 1. **Activity-Based Costing (ABC)**
   - **Example:** As a head of engineering, you might oversee multiple teams working on various features. ABC helps you understand which features or technical projects consume the most engineering hours, server costs, or tools/licenses.
   - **Practical application:** 
     - If a legacy system maintenance project consumes disproportionate engineering hours compared to its business value, you could justify automating or decommissioning it.
     - You could analyze the true cost of adopting new tools by accounting for training, migration, and ongoing support.

---

### 2. **Price-Led Costing**
   - **Example:** In software development, market expectations often dictate the cost constraints of new features. For instance, if customers expect a $50/month SaaS product with specific capabilities, you must ensure development aligns with that price point.
   - **Practical application:** 
     - When developing a new feature for a competitive market, you might push for cost-efficient technologies or refactor codebases to stay within budget while meeting user demands.
     - This approach could guide prioritization in trade-off decisions like “build vs. buy.”

---

### 3. **Economic-Chain Costing**
   - **Example:** Understanding the cost structure of the entire development lifecycle, from product design to deployment, helps identify inefficiencies across the chain.
   - **Practical application:** 
     - If a new CI/CD pipeline will reduce build times by 30%, you could justify the upfront cost by analyzing its impact on reducing developer idle time and deployment delays.
     - Collaborate with the product and sales teams to assess how codebase optimizations (e.g., reducing load times) lower operational costs while improving customer retention.

---

### 4. **Economic Value Added (EVA)**
   - **Example:** EVA helps you evaluate whether engineering projects create tangible value for the organization after covering their costs.
   - **Practical application:**
     - You could measure whether a migration to a microservices architecture justifies its cost by showing how it improves scalability, developer velocity, and reduces downtime (and the associated operational costs).
     - Use EVA to justify investing in tech debt reduction by showing how it enables faster delivery of customer-facing features, directly increasing business revenue.

---

### 5. **Benchmarking**
   - **Example:** Comparing your team’s development practices, metrics, or tools against industry leaders helps you identify improvement opportunities.
   - **Practical application:**
     - Benchmark your software delivery metrics (e.g., lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery) against industry standards like the **DORA metrics** to identify bottlenecks and invest in improvements.
     - If your competitors are using advanced code review tools or automated testing frameworks, benchmarking might show where adopting similar tools would save costs or improve quality.

---

### Tying It All Together for a Head of Engineering
- **Strategic Decisions:** These tools can guide investments in engineering tools, processes, or teams that provide the best value for your company.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** They enable you to justify technical decisions (e.g., new infrastructure or refactoring efforts) in financial terms executives can understand.
- **Team Optimization:** You’ll identify inefficiencies and allocate resources more effectively across projects or teams.
