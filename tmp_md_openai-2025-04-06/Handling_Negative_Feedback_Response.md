Yes, the book "Radical Candor" does discuss how to handle situations when someone responds negatively to radical candor. Key points include:

1. **Gauging Feedback**: It's important to understand how your feedback is received. Feedback is measured not at the speaker’s mouth but at the listener’s ear. When delivering feedback, you should be fully present, pay attention to how the other person is reacting, and be willing to adjust your approach【8†source】.

2. **Responding to Negative Feedback**: When receiving negative feedback, it's crucial not to react defensively. Instead, listen with the intent to understand, not to respond. This helps reduce defensive reactions and enables you to decide whether you agree with the feedback. "Rewarding the candor" is recommended, which means showing gratitude for the criticism rather than just accepting it without question【16†source】.

3. **Five Steps to Respond to Negative Feedback**:
   - **Check Understanding**: Repeat back what you heard to confirm your understanding.
   - **Take Time**: Focus on listening and understanding in the moment; if you disagree, ask for time to think about the feedback.
   - **Find Common Ground**: Look for any aspect of the feedback you agree with.
   - **Discuss Disagreement**: Clearly state what you disagree with and why.
   - **Commit to Action**: Even if you can't agree on everything, find and commit to a course of action【17†source】.

These approaches emphasize listening, understanding, and respectful disagreement, underlining the importance of both challenging directly and showing care personally in the process of giving and receiving feedback.

I was thinking more about situations where the person receiving the feedback reacts defensively. How can the feedback given respond to that productively?

### Assistant - 2023-11-30 00:08:52

In situations where the person receiving feedback reacts defensively, the feedback giver can respond productively by following these strategies:

1. **Stay Calm and Understanding**: Recognize that defensiveness is a natural reaction. Stay calm and avoid escalating the situation.

2. **Listen Actively**: Show that you are listening and understand their perspective. This can help de-escalate the situation and demonstrate empathy.

3. **Acknowledge Their Feelings**: Validate their feelings without necessarily agreeing with their stance. Acknowledging emotions can reduce defensiveness.

4. **Clarify Your Intent**: Explain that your feedback comes from a place of wanting to help and support, not to criticize or belittle.

5. **Seek Clarification**: Ask questions to understand their perspective better. This can also give them a chance to reflect on their reaction.

6. **Offer to Revisit the Conversation**: If emotions are running high, suggest revisiting the conversation later. This gives both parties time to reflect and cool down.

7. **Focus on Specifics and Impact**: When revisiting the conversation, focus on specific behaviors and their impact, rather than perceived attitudes or personality traits.

8. **Encourage Open Dialogue**: Create an environment where the recipient feels safe to express their concerns and views.

9. **Provide Support and Resources**: Offer support and resources that can help them address the feedback constructively.

10. **Reflect on Your Delivery**: Consider if there's a way to modify your approach to make the feedback more palatable.

It's important to remember that feedback is a two-way street, and both parties should engage in the conversation with openness and a willingness to understand each other's perspectives.
