We have about $2 million in investments. We're hoping to retire in 10-20 years. We have about 50% of the funds in VTSAX, 40% in VTIAX, and 10% in VFTAX. The VTIAX hasn't been performing as well, so we're thinking of moving about 30% of our funds to VIAAX, and 10% to VFTAX. What are the pros and cons of this?

Your portfolio decisions reflect a thoughtful approach to diversification, and adjusting allocations in light of performance and your goals is natural. Here's a breakdown of the potential **pros and cons** of reallocating from VTIAX to VIAAX and VFTAX:

---

### **Pros**
1. **Increased Dividend Income (VIAAX)**  
   - VIAAX (Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund) focuses on high-dividend-yielding stocks, potentially providing more immediate income. This aligns well with retirement planning if income generation is a priority.

2. **Sustainability Tilt (VFTAX)**  
   - Adding to VFTAX (Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund) aligns with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing principles. If ESG investing is important to you, this adjustment reflects your values.

3. **Reduced Volatility (VIAAX)**  
   - High-dividend-paying companies are often more mature and stable, potentially lowering portfolio volatility, which can be comforting as you approach retirement.

4. **Divergence from Poor Performance (VTIAX)**  
   - If you're unhappy with VTIAX's performance, reallocating could remove underperforming assets. However, ensure this decision isn't driven purely by recent trends, as international exposure can play a long-term role in diversification.

---

### **Cons**
1. **Reduced International Diversification**  
   - VTIAX (Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund) provides broad exposure to international equities. Lowering your stake could reduce diversification and increase vulnerability to U.S.-specific market risks.

2. **Potential Sector Concentration (VIAAX)**  
   - High-dividend-yielding companies tend to be concentrated in specific sectors, such as utilities and financials, which may reduce diversification across the broader market.

3. **Performance Chasing Risk**  
   - Adjusting due to perceived underperformance might lead to missing out on a rebound in international markets. International equities historically go through periods of underperformance compared to U.S. markets but eventually catch up or outperform.

4. **ESG Limitations (VFTAX)**  
   - While VFTAX reflects your values, it excludes certain sectors, which could limit returns during periods when excluded sectors (e.g., energy) perform strongly.

5. **Transaction Costs and Tax Implications**  
   - Reallocating funds might trigger capital gains taxes in a taxable account. Evaluate the cost of selling VTIAX shares before proceeding.

---

### **Questions to Consider**
1. **Risk Tolerance:** Are you comfortable with potentially higher U.S. market exposure and reduced international diversification?  
2. **Income Needs:** Do you prioritize steady dividend income over potential long-term growth from international equities?  
3. **Long-Term Strategy:** Is this shift part of a strategic plan, or is it driven by short-term market performance?  
4. **Tax Implications:** Are these funds in taxable accounts, and if so, have you evaluated the potential tax burden?  

---

### **Suggestions**
1. **Analyze Current Allocations:** Revisit your risk tolerance and goals to ensure that this shift aligns with your long-term strategy.  
2. **Partial Reallocation:** Consider reallocating less aggressively (e.g., 10%-15% from VTIAX) to maintain some international diversification while exploring VIAAX and VFTAX benefits.  
3. **Tax-Efficient Planning:** If reallocating in a taxable account, consult a financial advisor or tax professional to minimize capital gains impact.  
4. **Stay Disciplined:** Ensure any changes are part of a broader investment strategy and not a reaction to recent market performance.

I've provided a detailed comparison of the current and proposed portfolio's growth and risk metrics. You can review the expected annual returns, portfolio risk (standard deviation), and projected values for 10 and 20 years to see how the changes might impact your investment strategy. Let me know if you'd like further analysis or explanation!
