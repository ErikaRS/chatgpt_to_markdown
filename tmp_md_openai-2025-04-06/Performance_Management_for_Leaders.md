How to navigate performance management for a leader whose performance is generally good but many people decide they don't want to interact with them because of their general attitude

### Assistant - 2024-02-08 19:41:58

Navigating performance management for a leader with good performance but problematic interactions due to their attitude involves a delicate balance of addressing interpersonal issues while preserving their strengths. Here are several steps to consider:

1. **Objective Assessment**: Begin by gathering specific, objective examples of the behaviors that are causing concern. This should include instances of interactions that others found off-putting or counterproductive, as well as any patterns of behavior that have led to decreased team cohesion or morale.

2. **Feedback Session**: Arrange a private, constructive feedback session with the leader. It's crucial that this session is framed positively, focusing on their value to the organization and the desire to help them grow even more effective in their role. Use the collected examples to provide clear, actionable feedback on how their attitude impacts others and the team's performance.

3. **Create a Development Plan**: Work together to develop a plan for improvement. This plan might include specific behavioral changes, communication skills development, leadership coaching, or even emotional intelligence training. Setting clear, measurable goals is key, as is establishing a timeline for achieving these goals.

4. **Provide Support and Resources**: Ensure the leader has access to the necessary resources to support their development. This could involve providing a mentor, arranging for leadership coaching, or enrolling them in relevant workshops or courses. The organization's support is critical to the leader's success in making the necessary changes.

5. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular follow-up meetings to discuss progress, address any new issues, and adjust the development plan as necessary. These check-ins are an opportunity to provide ongoing support, recognize improvements, and keep the leader accountable for their development.

6. **Encourage Self-reflection**: Encourage the leader to engage in self-reflection on their behavior and its impacts. Self-awareness is a crucial component of leadership development, and understanding their own motivations and behaviors can help them make lasting changes.

7. **Focus on Positive Reinforcement**: Recognize and reinforce positive changes in behavior. Positive reinforcement can be highly effective in encouraging continued progress.

8. **Address Persistent Issues**: If, despite these efforts, the leader does not make the necessary improvements, it may be necessary to consider more significant interventions, such as changing their role within the organization or, in extreme cases, parting ways.

Managing this process requires sensitivity, confidentiality, and patience. It's important to protect the leader's dignity and respect their contributions while also making clear the need for change. Ultimately, the goal is to help the leader grow and succeed, benefiting both the individual and the organization.

What if they don't acknowledge that there is an issue even when given concrete specific feedback about their behavior and the impact?

When a leader does not acknowledge an issue even after being given concrete, specific feedback about their behavior and its impact, it presents a challenging situation. However, there are still steps you can take to address the issue and work towards a resolution:

1. **Ensure Clarity and Understanding**: First, ensure that the feedback was communicated clearly and understood as intended. Sometimes, a lack of acknowledgment can stem from misunderstanding the feedback or its seriousness. Reiterate the concerns, providing specific examples, and clarify the expected changes in behavior.

2. **Explore Underlying Causes**: Attempt to uncover any underlying reasons for the leader's reluctance to acknowledge the issue. This can involve deeper conversations about their perspectives, feelings, and any external factors that might be influencing their behavior or their response to feedback.

3. **Engage in Active Listening**: Show empathy and actively listen to their side of the story. Understanding their viewpoint can provide insights into why they might not see the issue as others do. This step can also help in building trust, which is crucial for any behavioral change.

4. **Leverage 360-Degree Feedback**: If the leader is still resistant to acknowledging the issue, consider implementing a 360-degree feedback process. This approach gathers anonymous feedback from peers, subordinates, and superiors, providing a comprehensive view of the leader's behavior. The aggregated feedback can highlight consistent concerns that are hard to ignore.

5. **Involve a Neutral Third Party**: Sometimes, bringing in an external coach or a mediator can help. A neutral third party can provide an objective perspective and help the leader understand the impact of their behavior without feeling attacked or defensive.

6. **Set Clear Consequences**: Clearly outline the potential consequences of not addressing the feedback, including impacts on the team's performance, their personal career progression, and potential disciplinary actions. It's important that these consequences are communicated as a natural outcome of their choices rather than as threats.

7. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of all meetings, feedback given, plans for improvement, and any subsequent actions. Documentation is crucial both for tracking progress and for supporting any future decisions that may need to be made regarding the leader's role within the organization.

8. **Review Organizational Fit**: If there's persistent refusal to acknowledge or address the behavior, it may be necessary to evaluate whether the leader is a good fit for their current role or the organization. Sometimes, despite everyone's best efforts, a change is needed to protect the team's well-being and the organization's culture.

9. **Prepare for Difficult Decisions**: Ultimately, if there is no improvement and the leader continues to refuse to acknowledge the issue, you may need to make tough decisions regarding their future in the organization. This could involve role changes, performance improvement plans, or, as a last resort, termination.

Addressing these situations requires a combination of patience, firmness, and compassion. The goal should always be to support the leader in making the necessary changes while also safeguarding the interests and well-being of the team and organization.

There are some situations where what someone needs to hear is, "dude, people think you're defensive" in a way that is frank and blunt. But if a manager is that blunt, they may be seen as too legitimately too aggressive given the power dynamic. 

### Assistant - 2024-02-08 19:45:55

In situations where a direct and blunt approach seems necessary but could be perceived as overly aggressive due to the power dynamic, it's important to find a balance that communicates the message effectively without causing defensiveness or resentment. Here are strategies to convey a frank message in a constructive manner:

1. **Use "I" Statements**: Begin statements with "I" to express your observations and feelings without placing direct blame. For example, "I've noticed that in meetings, there seems to be a reaction from the team when they perceive responses as defensive."

2. **Focus on Impact**: Rather than labeling the behavior directly, focus on the impact it has on the team or the environment. "When people sense defensiveness, it can shut down open dialogue and collaboration, affecting team dynamics."

3. **Invite Self-reflection**: Encourage the individual to reflect on their behavior by asking open-ended questions. "Have you noticed moments when your responses might be perceived as defensive? What do you think prompts that reaction?"

4. **Offer Specific Examples**: Provide specific, recent examples where the behavior was observed. This makes the feedback tangible and less likely to be dismissed as a generalization. "In last week's meeting, when your suggestion was questioned, the response seemed to close off further discussion. What was your perspective on that interaction?"

5. **Emphasize Growth and Support**: Make it clear that the feedback is aimed at their growth and success. "I'm bringing this up because I believe in your capabilities and want to see you succeed in your role. How can we work together on this?"

6. **Create a Safe Environment**: Ensure that the feedback is given in a private, safe environment where the individual feels comfortable to be vulnerable and open. This also shows respect for their dignity.

7. **Offer Concrete Steps and Support**: Instead of leaving the feedback as a critique, offer suggestions for improvement and support. "Let's explore strategies for handling feedback in a way that fosters open communication. Would you be interested in resources or training on effective communication?"

8. **Follow-Up and Progress Check-ins**: Schedule follow-up meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and successes. This ongoing support underscores the commitment to their development.

9. **Model the Behavior You Want to See**: Demonstrate openness and non-defensiveness in your own behavior. Leaders who practice what they preach encourage similar behavior in others.

10. **Encourage a Two-Way Dialogue**: Finally, give them the opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings about the feedback. This can lead to a more nuanced understanding of their behavior and how it's perceived by others.

By approaching the situation with empathy, focusing on growth, and offering support, managers can deliver even blunt feedback in a way that's constructive and encourages positive change. This approach helps maintain the professional relationship and supports the development of a more open and collaborative team dynamic.
