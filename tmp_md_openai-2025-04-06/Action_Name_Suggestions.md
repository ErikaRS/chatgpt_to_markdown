I am playing a board game where the theme is that you're controlling a mining robot on a planet in space. Your goal is to move around the planet and mine resources. Those resources can be used in various ways: upgrading your bot, utilizing facilities on the planet, defending the primary facility, etc. the actions associated with the move and mine actions are called, straight forward enough, move and mind. But the action associated with using resources is called connect and associated with an electrical plug icon ðŸ”Œ. This kind of makes sense because there is a transfer of resources between your bot and other things that consume those resources. However, it also feels like a not great name. Suggest 9 other names along with their reasoning.

Here are nine alternative names for the "connect" action, each with reasoning to fit the theme of mining robots on a planet in space:

1. **Transfer**  
   - Highlights the idea of moving resources from your bot to a facility or other object, emphasizing the exchange or reallocation of resources.

2. **Charge**  
   - Evokes the image of plugging into a facility to provide or receive energy or resources, aligning with the electrical plug icon.

3. **Supply**  
   - Suggests the act of delivering resources to something that needs them, reflecting the functional exchange of materials.

4. **Integrate**  
   - Implies forming a connection or a seamless transfer of resources to enhance or use external systems, reinforcing the sci-fi setting.

5. **Power**  
   - Suggests that resources are used to energize or activate facilities, emphasizing the role of your bot in enabling operations.

6. **Link**  
   - Evokes the idea of establishing a connection for resource transfer, resonating with the plug icon while being concise and thematic.

7. **Deploy**  
   - Implies strategic usage of resources, as if deploying them for a specific purpose like defense or upgrades.

8. **Sync**  
   - Suggests a two-way interaction or alignment of your bot's systems with a facility or structure, reinforcing the interconnectedness of your actions.

9. **Fuse**  
   - Adds a sense of combining or merging resources with the facility or target, giving a more active and evocative feel to the action.

Each of these names reflects a different nuance of what "connect" might represent in the game, offering clarity and alignment with the theme. Would you like to explore how these names might influence the tone of the game?
