Turn this brain dump into a slack message memo appropriate for sending from me (head of engineering) to my boss the CEO and to the CTO (my organizational uncle)

I was just chatting with Matt, and one thing that he mentioned that was really intriguing is that while Varun will be happy with the equity grant, what would most make Varun retain for a long time is feeling like the Graph team is staffed up enough to get past the KTLO work plus syntactic and being able to contribute to more ambitious plans (like real Graph context).

The challenge with that is that even with all the good folks I've been talking to in SF, I still haven't found anyone to direct to the Graph team. I think the skill set that team is looking for is specialized enough that if we slice to SF, it's going to be even harder to find. 

So, what would you both think if were to make a location exception for the Graph team hire to broader the pool of folks with the right domain expertise.

We can wait a couple months or until we've hit some number of SF accepted offers so that we don't take talent team focus off of SF.

Here's a polished version of your brain dump, framed as a Slack message to your CEO and CTO:

Hey [CEO] and [CTO],

I was chatting with Matt, and he brought up something interesting. While Varun will definitely be happy with the equity grant, what would really help retain him long-term is seeing the Graph team staffed well enough to move beyond KTLO and syntactic work and start contributing to more ambitious goals (like real Graph context).

The challenge here is that even with all the great people I’ve been talking to in SF, I haven’t found anyone suitable for the Graph team. Their skill set is specialized enough that if we limit our search to SF, it’s going to be really tough to find the right fit.

What do you both think about making an exception for the Graph team hire and expanding our location pool to find someone with the right domain expertise? 

We could wait a couple of months or until we’ve hit a specific number of SF offers to keep our talent team focused on SF in the short term, but I think this might be worth considering for the long haul.

Let me know your thoughts!

This keeps it concise and frames the issue while offering a potential solution.

Make this updated version 50-75% of the length (shorter is better as long as it doesn't lose any material facts)

Hey [CEO] and [CTO],

I was chatting with Matt, and he mentioned that while Varun will appreciate the equity grant, retaining him long-term will depend on staffing the Graph team well enough to move beyond KTLO and syntactic work into more ambitious goals (like real Graph context for Cody).

The challenge is that I haven’t found anyone in SF with the specialized skills they need. Limiting the search to SF makes this harder.

What do you think about making an exception for the Graph team and expanding the search to remote talent with the right expertise?

We could wait a couple of months or hit a certain number of SF hires before shifting focus, but this might be worth considering now.
