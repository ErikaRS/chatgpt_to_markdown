Here are a few suggestions for the third item to finish off your gift:

1. **Artistic Bookmark** – A handmade or artistic bookmark that complements the style of the novel could be a thoughtful and practical addition.
2. **Incense or Scented Candle** – Something that evokes a sense of relaxation or mystery, pairing well with the wishing stone’s magical vibe.
3. **Notebook or Journal** – A small journal with an interesting or mystical cover for the recipient to jot down thoughts, inspired by the wishing stone and novel.
4. **Decorative Trinket Dish** – A small dish for keeping the wishing stone or other personal treasures, adding a magical touch.
5. **Fairy Lights** – A small set of warm-toned fairy lights to create a cozy reading nook, tying into the whimsical feel of the wishing stone and novel.
6. **Tea Sampler** – A set of herbal teas that could be enjoyed while reading, adding a sensory experience to the gift.
7. **Tarot or Oracle Deck** – If the recipient is into mystical elements, this could complement the wishing stone and add another layer of intrigue.

Would any of these match the vibe you're going for?

Here are more whimsical ideas that steer away from the magical theme:

1. **Whimsical Socks** – Fun, quirky socks featuring space themes or playful patterns that match the light-hearted sci-fi tone of the novel.
2. **Miniature Puzzle** – A small, quirky puzzle with an imaginative or abstract design to evoke a sense of playful challenge.
3. **Retro Postcards** – A set of vintage or retro-futuristic postcards, perhaps with whimsical space or adventure themes, adding a touch of nostalgic fun.
4. **Colorful Fidget Toy** – A small, quirky fidget toy like a puzzle cube or a squishy character, something playful to go along with the sci-fi vibe.
5. **Illustrated Playing Cards** – A deck of playing cards with whimsical, creative designs, like animals in spacesuits or humorous depictions of aliens.
6. **Pop Art Coaster Set** – A set of coasters featuring colorful, bold, and playful artwork, adding a touch of everyday whimsy to the gift.
7. **Silly Putty or Kinetic Sand** – A fun, tactile item to keep hands busy while reading or dreaming up sci-fi worlds.

These items should add a playful, lighthearted touch to the gift set while staying aligned with the overall whimsical tone you're after.

4. **Herbal Bath Soak** – A small packet of calming bath salts or bath soak to enhance relaxation, perfect for unwinding after a long day.
5. **Hand Cream** – A soothing, natural hand cream with a calming scent like lavender or eucalyptus, to add a bit of self-care while reading.
