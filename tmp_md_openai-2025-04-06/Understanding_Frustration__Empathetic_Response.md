Help me draft a response to this that acknowledges the Person B's frustration without sounding condescending.

Person A:
Hi Person A, as <CEO> mentioned, we made the incredibly difficult decision to part ways with <Manager>.  I am sure this comes as a surprise and I know that this must be really hard for you. As part of the re-org, your new manager will be me, and you'll be continuing to work on code intel.  I want you to know that I'm available to support you in any way, and my door is always open should you have questions or just want to chat.  I'm here for you.

Person B:
Hey Person A. The way this was done, the way my message got deleted in #ask-people-team, and the way the people responsible for endless pivots and fruitless reorgs have the audacity to blame others - all of this is despicable.
You directly benefitted from this reorg and by extension have enabled it by lack of action
I'm sure you're here for me. (edited)

Certainly, it's important to address such concerns with empathy and understanding. Here's a possible response:

Hi Person B,

I genuinely understand your frustration and concerns. The decisions made and the way they've been communicated have clearly affected you, and for that, I am sorry. Please know that I value open dialogue and take your feedback seriously. If there's any way we can work through this together, or if you'd like to further discuss your concerns, I'm here to listen and support.

Best,
Person A

Revise it to convey a bit more of a "I get it, and you're right that this has been frustrating"

Of course, here's a revised response:

Hi Person B,

You're right. The way things have been handled and communicated has been frustrating, and I genuinely understand where you're coming from. I apologize for the impact this has had on you. Your feedback is important, and I genuinely want to address and work through any concerns you have. Please let me know how best I can support you during this time.

Best,
Person A
