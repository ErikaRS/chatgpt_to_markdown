Structuring a performance improvement plan (PIP) for someone who does good work but brings a problematic attitude is hard. What are concrete exit criteria for a PIP for someone who always leaves a negative impression, talks too long and off topic, turns things into "us vs them" and doesn't recognize that owning the technical problem is not enough to solve the business problem? The person is a director of engineering so leadership and collaboration are a key part the their role.

The exit criteria need to set a high bar such that if the person succeeds it will be a sign that they have the right attitude to succeed in a collaborative environment. They shouldn't be things where they can succeed through effort but then relapse. But the criteria should also be concrete and specific enough that we can evaluate clearly whether or not they have succeeded and so that they clearly understand what is expected of them. Since this is a director role, this needs to happen in the course of their work, not be a special project designed for the PIP.

Creating a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) for a Director of Engineering with a problematic attitude involves a delicate balance between setting achievable, concrete goals and ensuring these goals are aligned with the essential leadership and collaborative qualities required for the role. The PIP should focus on tangible improvements in behavior that directly impact team dynamics, communication, and project outcomes, ensuring that success criteria are clear, measurable, and sustainable over time. Here are several concrete exit criteria to consider:

1. **Improved Team Engagement and Morale:**
   - Conduct 360-degree feedback sessions before, during, and at the end of the PIP to measure improvements in team morale and engagement.
   - Success Criterion: A noticeable improvement in team feedback regarding the Director's communication style, attitude towards teamwork, and overall impact on team morale.

2. **Effective Meeting Management:**
   - Implement and adhere to structured meeting agendas, with a clear focus on relevance and efficiency.
   - Success Criterion: A reduction in off-topic discussions as reported by team members and observed in follow-up meetings, with at least 90% of meetings starting and ending on time and achieving their set objectives.

3. **Promotion of a Collaborative Culture:**
   - Demonstrate active participation in cross-functional teams, showing an understanding and respect for diverse perspectives.
   - Success Criterion: Positive feedback from cross-functional team leaders on the Director's contribution to fostering a collaborative environment, including specific examples of where their input led to constructive, inclusive solutions.

4. **Leadership Development:**
   - Participate in leadership coaching or training specifically targeted at emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and effective communication.
   - Success Criterion: Coach or trainer’s assessment indicates significant improvement in leadership qualities, specifically in areas of empathy, listening, and constructive feedback.

5. **Business and Technical Problem-Solving Integration:**
   - Lead at least two projects from conception to completion, demonstrating an integrated approach to solving business and technical problems.
   - Success Criterion: Project reviews show that the Director effectively balanced technical solutions with business needs, including positive feedback from stakeholders on the integration of business objectives within technical frameworks.

6. **Consistent Follow-Up and Review:**
   - Set up regular review sessions with HR or a mentor to track progress against the PIP objectives, including setting specific milestones and KPIs to measure improvement.
   - Success Criterion: Achieving or exceeding all set milestones and KPIs, with documentation of progress and areas of improvement in each review session.

7. **Sustainability of Change:**
   - Show continuous improvement and maintenance of positive behaviors and attitudes beyond the formal end of the PIP period.
   - Success Criterion: No regression observed in behaviors that led to the PIP during a set monitoring period post-PIP (e.g., 6 months), as confirmed by ongoing feedback from the team and stakeholders.

Each of these criteria should be tailored to the individual’s specific issues and the organization's context, ensuring they are both challenging and achievable. The key to a successful PIP, especially for a leadership role, lies in clear communication of expectations, regular and transparent feedback loops, and providing the necessary support for the individual to achieve these goals.
