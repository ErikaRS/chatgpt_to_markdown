In the passage you provided, the term "bushed" is used to describe how the safe winter travel ways were maintained by the government. This usage of "bushed" seems to refer to the practice of placing bushes or branches along a road or path to mark it, especially in snowy or difficult conditions, making it easier for travelers to follow the route.

Historically, before the widespread use of modern road signs or snow plows, people would use natural markers like bushes to indicate a safe path through areas that could be obscured by snow or other environmental factors. This was particularly important in rural or less developed regions, where formal infrastructure was limited. The "benevolent Government" in the passage likely refers to authorities taking responsibility for ensuring that these paths remained visible and safe during the winter months. This practice would have been common in areas with heavy snowfall, such as in parts of Canada or the northern United States, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The practice of marking paths with bushes or branches, often referred to as "bushing," has a long history in regions with harsh winters. This practice was particularly common in rural or frontier areas where snowfall could obscure roads and paths, making it difficult or dangerous to travel.

### Historical References:

1. **Canada and Northern United States:**
   - In early Canadian and Northern U.S. settlements, especially in regions like the Maritimes or the Great Lakes area, it was common to mark winter roads with bushes. These roads were often used for sleigh travel over frozen lakes, rivers, and snow-covered landscapes. The bushes served as guides to keep travelers on the safe path and to avoid thin ice or snowdrifts.
   - For example, during the 19th century in rural Quebec, travelers would use "snow roads" in winter, which were often lined with branches or fir trees stuck in the snow at regular intervals to guide sleighs and prevent them from getting lost.

2. **Nordic Countries:**
   - In countries like Norway, Sweden, and Finland, similar practices were employed in wintertime. Roads and paths were marked with fir trees or other evergreen branches, especially in the wilderness or across frozen lakes. This method was essential for both local residents and postal routes to ensure safe passage during the long winter months.

3. **Russia:**
   - In Russia, particularly in Siberian regions, roads and paths were often marked with poles or bushes in the snow to help guide travelers and ensure that horse-drawn sledges could navigate the vast, snowy expanses.

### Articles and Resources:

- **"Winter Roads in Early Canadian History"** - This article might explore how early Canadian settlers adapted to the harsh winters by creating and maintaining winter roads, including the practice of marking paths with bushes. Sources like Canadian historical journals or local historical societies might have documented these practices.

- **"The Role of Winter Roads in Northern Rural Communities"** - A scholarly article might examine the importance of winter roads for commerce, communication, and travel in rural Northern communities, with references to the bushing practice.

- **"Traveling in the Winter: The History of Snow Roads"** - This could be an article or chapter in a book focusing on winter travel in historical contexts, discussing how different cultures adapted to snow-covered landscapes.

- **"Siberian Survival: Navigation and Transportation in a Frozen Wilderness"** - This type of article might explore how Siberian communities used natural markers to survive and navigate the extreme winter conditions.

Finding specific articles or books that reference this practice may require access to historical databases, archives, or local historical societies' publications. Many of these practices were passed down orally or mentioned in travel diaries, letters, and local history texts rather than formal academic articles. However, local historical societies, museums, or libraries in regions where this practice was common may have additional resources or references.
