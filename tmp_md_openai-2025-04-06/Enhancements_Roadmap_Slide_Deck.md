How would you message this to customers is a product roadmap slide deck.?

We are working on a project called "More Zero Config Code Intelligence". Code Intelligence powers navigation between symbols in code files. Today's search based code intelligence is just based on textual matching of names. By upgrading this path to use a parsed data structure, we can improve the quality of navigation, e.g., knowing that a reference to a method is, in fact, a reference to a method, not just something else. Although this approach still is missing compiler-level accuracy, e.g., knowing exactly which instance of a method is being referred to or being able to distinguish between parameters and local variables. 

An example of a roadmap item on a different topic is: 
Perforce is one of the most used code hosts for companies across gaming, automotive, and healthcare industries. 
Now, Sourcegraph has full support for Perforce depots including streams support, sub-repo permissions, and native batch changes support allowing customers to search *all* of their code, regardless of where it is stored.
