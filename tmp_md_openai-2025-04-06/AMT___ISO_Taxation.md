If you pay AMT for incentive stock option exercises and then eventually are able to use all of the AMT access as tax credits, doesn't that effectively mean that you didn't pay taxes on the spread between the exercise price of the strike price?

The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a mandatory alternative to the standard income tax. It's designed to prevent high-income individuals from using tax breaks to avoid paying taxes. When you exercise incentive stock options (ISOs), the difference between the fair market value at the time of exercise and the exercise price (often called the "bargain element" or the "spread") can trigger the AMT. 

This doesn't mean you're paying taxes on the spread immediately in the typical sense. Under the regular tax rules, you're not taxed on the spread until you sell the stock and realize the gain. But under AMT rules, the spread at the time of exercise is treated as income, which can result in you having to pay the AMT.

The amount of AMT you pay that's above your regular tax liability becomes a "minimum tax credit" (MTC) that you can use in future years to lower your tax bill. However, you can only use this credit in years when your regular tax exceeds your AMT. Therefore, while the MTC can eventually offset the AMT paid, it doesn't necessarily mean that you didn't pay taxes on the spread.

Instead, it's more accurate to say that the tax payment was deferred. You pay AMT at the time of exercise, then get to use the MTC to offset regular tax in future years when you sell the stock and recognize income under the regular tax rules. 

In effect, you're paying tax earlier than you would under the regular tax rules (at the time of exercise instead of at the time of sale), but the overall tax paid could be the same assuming you are able to fully utilize the AMT credit. However, the timing and availability of the MTC can result in significant complexity and potential cash flow issues.

Remember, tax rules are complicated and can change, and individual circumstances can significantly affect tax liabilities. It's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional before making decisions related to exercising stock options or other complex financial transactions.

When you sell an ISO that was subject to AMT, are you taxed on the difference between the sale price and the exercise price or are you taxed on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the day you exercise?

When you exercise an Incentive Stock Option (ISO) and hold the shares beyond the calendar year of exercise, it's called a "qualifying disposition." For a sale to be a qualifying disposition, you must sell the stock at least:

1. Two years after the grant date of the stock option, and
2. One year after the stock was transferred to you.

If your sale meets these requirements, then for regular tax purposes, your gain will be the difference between the sale price and the exercise price, and it will be taxed at long-term capital gains rates, which are typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.

However, for AMT purposes, when you exercised the ISO, the spread between the exercise price and the Fair Market Value (FMV) at exercise was considered "income," potentially triggering the AMT. This amount is then your cost basis for AMT purposes. When you sell the stock, the gain for AMT purposes will be the difference between the sale price and the FMV on the date of exercise.

The way the AMT works can be complex, and the interaction of the regular tax and the AMT can produce unexpected results. You might have to pay AMT in the year of exercise, but then you could potentially recover some or all of that amount in later years through the minimum tax credit. It's important to understand that the use of the minimum tax credit can be subject to limitations, depending on your individual tax situation in each year.

In general, it's recommended to seek advice from a tax professional who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances. This is especially true for transactions involving stock options, which can have complicated tax implications.

How is the gain computed for standard taxes? Is that based on the exercise price or the fair market value price at time of exercise if you had paid amt at that time?

For regular federal income tax purposes, when you sell stock acquired through the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option (ISO), the gain (or loss) is the difference between your selling price and the price you paid to exercise the options (the "exercise price" or "strike price"). This is true even if you paid Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on the spread between the exercise price and the fair market value at the time of exercise. 

This gain or loss will typically be treated as a capital gain or loss because you are selling a capital asset. If you held the stock for more than one year after exercising the options (and also met the requirement of holding it for at least two years after the grant date of the option), then the gain or loss is treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, which is typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

The AMT that you might have paid when you exercised the options does not affect the calculation of your gain or loss for regular tax purposes when you sell the stock. However, the AMT you paid can result in a minimum tax credit that you can use in later years to lower your regular tax. 

This interaction between regular tax and AMT is one of the reasons the taxation of ISOs can be complex. As always, it's recommended to consult a tax professional when dealing with complex financial transactions, as individual circumstances can greatly impact your tax liability.
