Please suggest ways to make this clearer.

Top level message:
:thinksmart: 2025 MSEM and eng
As you may have seen in today's Q1 kickoff (slide notes), we have a new MSEM! The high level themes of our strategy are:
Build toward one lovable code intelligence product
Delight pro devs to win enterprises
Narrow our focus
I want to reflect on how this connects to the work we're doing and the May Product Focused Planning. :thread-pink:

Thread part 1:
Build toward one lovable code intelligence product
By (or before) the end of the year: We will have one unified code intelligence product
We've been talking about "Better Together" for months now, and I see this as the natural evolution of that line of thinking. The things we've been planning to bring Cody and Code Search closer together, such as bringing search to Cody, understanding the role of Cody Web, and bringing more sources of context to Cody are a great start.
There's a lot more to do here, and as a first step, we need to work closely with the Product and Design teams to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what it means to build one lovable code intelligence product. This will help us make the architectural decisions that will allow us to move more quickly.
Figuring out what this means from both a product and architectural perspective will be a key focus of our team time at Merge.
We also need to continue our focus on lovability. Products that delight individual devs are the ones that will ultimately win and retain enterprise users. If individual devs are not getting value out of our products, then we won't see the retention and growth that will make us successful.

Thread part 2: 
Delight pro devs to win enterprises
If a dev loves Pro, they can quickly and easily migrate/upgrade to Enterprise
Today, there's not a clear conveyor belt of features from PLG to Enterprise. By the end of this year, if a feature makes it to GA for PLG, it will be available on Enterprise within a reasonable amount of time. We also want to make the upgrade process itself easier. Today, there are many reasons it is hard to upgrade from Pro to Enterprise, some incidental (we haven't heavily invested in those flows) others more fundamental (setting up a Sourcegraph instance is a pain... and where the differentiating value comes from). In the future we should be able to support self-service upgrades... without having a high baseline cost to serve those customers.
Figuring out this will also tie back to the architectural discussions we want to have a Merge.

Thread part 3:
Narrow our focus
I consistently hear feedback that teams have a hard time making decisions on whether or not to take on a particular customer request or bug fix. We have an incredibly large surface area for the size of our team. We can't maintain it all at the same level of fidelity while also working on advancing our other goals. However, we also have customers that use these features, so we can't just willy nilly neglect things.
As a rough rule of thumb, we should aim for 80% of our work being on features that deliver value to all customers and 20% on features that are enterprise specific. That means we may sometimes need to push back against customer support requests, and we need to get systems in place to make clear decisions there.
There are other ways we can apply this goal, but continuing to find the right balance here is a great place to start.

**Top Level Message:**
üîç **2025 Strategy Update: MSEM & Engineering Goals**

Welcome to our Q1 kickoff! As highlighted today, we‚Äôre introducing a new direction with our 2025 MSEM strategy, focusing on three core themes:
- **Unifying Our Code Intelligence Products**
- **Enhancing Pro Developer Experience to Win Enterprises**
- **Sharpening Our Focus**

Let‚Äôs explore how these themes align with our ongoing projects and the upcoming May Product-Focused Planning. üßµ

**Thread Part 1: Unifying Our Code Intelligence Products**

By year's end, our goal is to launch a single, unified code intelligence platform. This initiative, stemming from our "Better Together" philosophy, aims to merge Cody and Code Search functionalities, enhancing features like search in Cody, Cody Web's integration, and adding more contextual sources.

Our immediate steps involve close collaboration with the Product and Design teams to clarify our vision and ensure our architecture supports rapid development. This endeavor is crucial for our discussions at Merge, focusing on product appeal and architecture.

**Thread Part 2: Winning Enterprises by Delighting Pro Developers**

Our strategy is simple: if developers love Pro, upgrading to Enterprise should be seamless. We're working to streamline the feature transfer from PLG to Enterprise, ensuring new features are available across both platforms promptly. Our goal is to simplify the upgrade process, addressing both the practical and technical challenges currently faced.

This effort will also be a key discussion point at Merge, particularly around architectural improvements.

**Thread Part 3: Sharpening Our Focus**

Balancing customer requests and bug fixes has been challenging due to our broad scope. Moving forward, we aim to dedicate 80% of our efforts to universally beneficial features and 20% to enterprise-specific enhancements. This approach will involve setting clear priorities and possibly declining certain support requests to maintain our strategic focus.

**Feedback and Further Ideas**

I‚Äôm eager to hear your thoughts or any additional ideas on how we can align our efforts with the company‚Äôs strategic goals. Let‚Äôs discuss how we can collectively contribute to these objectives and make a significant impact.
