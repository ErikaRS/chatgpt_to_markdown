When I get my braces adjusted it seems like all they do is replace the wire. How does that actually do anything?

When you get your braces adjusted, replacing the wire is a key part of how the treatment works. The wire used in braces is designed to apply continuous, gentle pressure to your teeth. Hereâ€™s how replacing the wire makes a difference:

1. **Increasing the Force**: Different wires have varying thicknesses and flexibility. At the beginning of your treatment, thinner and more flexible wires are used to gently start aligning your teeth. As your teeth begin to move and align, your orthodontist replaces the wire with thicker, stiffer ones that exert more force. This increased force continues to guide your teeth into the desired positions.

2. **Changing Wire Shape or Tension**: The new wires may have different shapes or tensions that target specific tooth movements. These adjustments fine-tune how your teeth shift, focusing on precise movements as the treatment progresses.

3. **Customized Adjustments**: Sometimes, specific bends or adjustments are added to the wire to correct complex alignment issues. The wire replacement allows for these customizations to address your unique orthodontic needs.

Overall, while it might seem like a small change, the wire swap is a critical step in applying the right pressure to move your teeth efficiently over time. Each wire replacement advances your treatment toward the final alignment.
