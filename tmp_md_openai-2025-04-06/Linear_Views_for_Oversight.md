How do I get a team performance overview style view in linear? 

### Assistant - 2024-09-30 13:59:45

While Linear doesn't have a native, fully-featured "team performance overview" dashboard out-of-the-box, you can create a similar view by utilizing some of its existing features and combining them with reports and metrics available in Linear. Here's how you can get a team performance overview in Linear:

### 1. **Cycle Metrics**
   - **How to access:** Go to the "Cycles" view and select a specific cycle or sprint.
   - **What it shows:** This gives you an overview of the team's velocity, including completed issues, carryover work from previous cycles, and unplanned work added mid-cycle.
   - **How it helps:** It helps you see how much work was planned versus completed, and how effectively the team is delivering on commitments. This is great for tracking team throughput and spotting trends in scope creep or delivery reliability.

### 2. **Velocity Chart**
   - **How to access:** In the "Cycles" tab, you’ll find a velocity chart that tracks how many issues a team has completed per cycle over time.
   - **What it shows:** Velocity gives insight into how quickly teams are completing work. It helps gauge team capacity, and whether the team is improving or facing obstacles.
   - **How it helps:** Use this to assess if the team is overcommitting or under-delivering, and to guide better sprint planning.

### 3. **Burndown Chart**
   - **How to access:** Found in the "Cycle" view, it shows the progress of work completed over the duration of the cycle.
   - **What it shows:** Burndown charts help you see whether the team is on track to complete the work they committed to within the cycle's timeframe.
   - **How it helps:** Provides insight into how work is progressing, helps spot mid-cycle slowdowns, and allows for proactive interventions.

### 4. **Issue Analytics (Filters and Reports)**
   - **How to access:** Go to any team’s issue list and use filters to analyze:
     - Total issues completed vs. opened.
     - Bug counts vs. feature work.
     - Issue distribution by priority or status.
   - **What it shows:** By filtering issues by labels or types, you can gain insights into how much of the team's effort is spent on new feature development versus bug fixing or technical debt.
   - **How it helps:** These insights can highlight if too much time is being spent on reactive work (like bugs) or if planned work isn’t getting completed.

### 5. **Custom Filters for Key Metrics**
   - **How to set up:** Create custom views using filters to highlight:
     - High-priority issues in progress.
     - Blockers affecting progress.
     - Team workload balance by assignee (to check if work is distributed evenly).
   - **What it shows:** This offers a quick view of who is overloaded, what high-priority tasks are still pending, and any blockers affecting team performance.
   - **How it helps:** It helps balance workload, clear blockers, and ensure key work is progressing.

### 6. **Cross-Team Cycle Insights**
   - **How to access:** In the "Cycles" section, you can filter across multiple teams to get an aggregated view of cycles for multiple teams at once.
   - **What it shows:** By looking at velocity, carryover rates, and work completion across multiple teams, you can assess the overall health and throughput of your teams.
   - **How it helps:** This is useful for a cross-team view of performance, especially when teams are working on related projects or dependencies.

### 7. **Integrations with Analytics Tools**
   - **How to set up:** If you need a more comprehensive performance dashboard, you can integrate Linear with external reporting tools like **Coda**, **Notion**, or **Looker**, or use Linear's **API** to export data into custom dashboards.
   - **What it shows:** These tools allow for custom reporting on velocity, issue types, cycle completion rates, etc.
   - **How it helps:** You can get richer, more customizable team performance metrics tailored to your specific needs.

### 8. **Automations and Slack Integration for Updates**
   - **How to set up:** Use Linear's Slack integration to get automated reports on team performance, such as:
     - Issues completed this week.
     - Issues carried over from the last cycle.
     - Daily digests of what’s changed in the backlog.
   - **What it shows:** A snapshot of key performance indicators pushed to Slack, making it easier to keep an eye on team metrics without diving into the app.
   - **How it helps:** Provides a lightweight team performance overview without needing to regularly check Linear itself.

By using a combination of the "Cycles" view for velocity and burndown tracking, issue analytics for workload and priorities, and possibly leveraging integrations for advanced reporting, you can effectively create a team performance overview in Linear.

How can notion be used to support this big picture view of velocity?

### Assistant - 2024-09-30 14:07:50

Notion can be a powerful tool for creating a big-picture view of team velocity when integrated with Linear or used in parallel. Here’s how you can use Notion to support tracking and visualizing team velocity across different projects and teams:

### 1. **Create a Project/Task Dashboard**
   - **How to set up:** In Notion, create a database for projects and tasks that mirrors or pulls data from Linear via an integration. You can use this database to track:
     - **Issue statuses:** Open, In Progress, Done.
     - **Assignees** and teams.
     - **Cycle start and end dates** (sprints).
     - **Estimated points** or story points.
     - **Labels** (e.g., bug, feature, technical debt).
   - **How it helps:** You can track the progress of work at a high level, and filter it by team or project. The database can also display key fields like estimated points (to track velocity) and provide an overview of the progress over a specific period.

### 2. **Velocity Chart in Notion**
   - **How to set up:** Use linked databases to create a **Velocity Page** that aggregates data from multiple teams or cycles. You can manually track or pull in:
     - **Story points completed per cycle.**
     - **Workload per assignee or team.**
     - **Work completed vs. work added during a cycle** (scope changes).
   - **How it helps:** You can use these views to show the team’s completed work over time, compare velocity across cycles, and visualize trends. By adding Notion’s gallery or calendar views, you can organize velocity data by cycle and make it easy to spot high or low velocity trends.

### 3. **Automate with Linear Integration**
   - **How to set up:** Integrate Linear with Notion using third-party tools like Zapier, Automate.io, or Notion API to automate updates from Linear into your Notion databases. You can automatically populate your Notion tasks or project database with key data from Linear, like:
     - **Issue updates:** Every time a task changes status in Linear.
     - **Cycle information:** When a new sprint or cycle begins or ends.
     - **Completed work:** Push updates for when tasks are completed or story points are logged.
   - **How it helps:** This reduces manual data entry and ensures that Notion is always up to date with the most recent work completed in Linear. It also provides a real-time view of velocity without needing to switch between tools.

### 4. **Burndown Chart in Notion**
   - **How to set up:** While Notion doesn’t support native charts, you can create a burndown chart by embedding a third-party service (like Google Sheets or Coda) in a Notion page. 
     - Track the total story points at the beginning of the cycle, and plot the reduction of remaining points over time (daily or weekly).
   - **How it helps:** The embedded chart will automatically update when the source (e.g., Google Sheets) updates, giving you a visual burndown chart right inside your Notion workspace.

### 5. **Historical Velocity Tracking**
   - **How to set up:** Create a **velocity log** in Notion to manually track velocity per cycle across teams. Set up a database with columns for:
     - **Cycle start and end dates.**
     - **Story points completed.**
     - **Carryover work (issues that were carried over to the next cycle).**
     - **New work added mid-cycle.**
   - **How it helps:** This provides a historical view of team performance across multiple cycles. You can spot trends over time, understand how velocity fluctuates, and see how well teams stick to planned work.

### 6. **Custom Reports with Notion’s Formula and Rollup Properties**
   - **How to set up:** Use Notion’s formula and rollup properties in your project database to calculate velocity automatically:
     - **Total points completed per cycle.**
     - **Average velocity over the last few cycles.**
     - **Percentage of work added mid-cycle (scope creep).**
   - **How it helps:** Rollups can be used to summarize work from individual tasks into a big-picture view, and formulas can generate insights like percentage completion or deviation from planned velocity.

### 7. **Create a Goals & Metrics Dashboard**
   - **How to set up:** Use a high-level goals and metrics dashboard to track velocity alongside broader business goals or KPIs.
     - Link this dashboard to your project database and show how current team velocity aligns with your long-term goals.
   - **How it helps:** This allows you to track how team velocity impacts broader company goals, and how delivering on time (or not) impacts other metrics.

### 8. **Team Performance Overview Page**
   - **How to set up:** Create a dedicated **Team Performance Overview** page in Notion that pulls in filtered views from your databases. This can include:
     - Team-specific velocity tracking.
     - Cycle summaries (e.g., what was completed and carried over).
     - Upcoming tasks and deadlines.
     - Charts showing historical velocity trends.
   - **How it helps:** This provides a centralized location for managers and team leads to monitor overall team health and make data-driven decisions about resourcing, timelines, and workloads.

By using Notion to create custom databases, automation, and visual summaries, you can build a comprehensive view of velocity and team performance that’s easy to access and share across your company. The flexibility of Notion makes it easy to customize the exact level of detail you need, from broad overviews to granular metrics.
