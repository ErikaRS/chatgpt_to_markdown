That sounds like a description of *King Lear*, though the specifics are a bit off, as the central character isn’t a Duke but a king, and it involves two faithless daughters, not sons. 

However, the themes of betrayal and envy are very strong in *King Lear*, particularly as Lear is betrayed by those he trusts most. The Duke of Gloucester subplot also involves betrayal by Gloucester’s illegitimate son, Edmund, who deceives his father and brother due to his envy of his brother’s legitimate status.

If you’re interested in exploring themes of familial betrayal, envy, and tragic downfall in Shakespeare, *King Lear* is an excellent match despite the differences in character roles. Would you like a deeper look at those themes in *King Lear* or perhaps in another play with similar dynamics?
