Yes, the Methodists and Presbyterians, along with the Congregationalists, united in Canada in 1925 to form the United Church of Canada. This union was a significant event in Canadian religious history, bringing together a large portion of the Protestant community. However, not all Presbyterian congregations joined the union; a minority of Presbyterians chose to remain outside the United Church, continuing as the Presbyterian Church in Canada. The United Church of Canada became one of the largest Protestant denominations in the country following this union.

Did anything similar happen in the US?

In the United States, there hasn't been a union quite like the one that formed the United Church of Canada. However, there have been some significant mergers among Protestant denominations:

1. **United Methodist Church (1968):** The most notable union was between the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, which formed the United Methodist Church. This merger created one of the largest Protestant denominations in the U.S.

2. **Presbyterian Church (USA) (1983):** The two largest branches of Presbyterianism in the United States—the United Presbyterian Church in the USA and the Presbyterian Church in the United States—merged to form the Presbyterian Church (USA). This was a significant union for the Presbyterian community, though it didn't involve a merger with other Protestant denominations.

3. **United Church of Christ (1957):** Another significant union occurred when the Congregational Christian Churches and the Evangelical and Reformed Church merged to form the United Church of Christ (UCC). This union brought together two denominations with different theological and cultural backgrounds.

While these unions were significant, they were more about bringing together denominations with similar theological backgrounds rather than creating a broad, inclusive Protestant denomination like the United Church of Canada. The religious landscape in the U.S. remains more denominationally diverse compared to Canada's.
