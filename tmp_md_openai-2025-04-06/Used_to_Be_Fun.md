OMG - there needs to be a parady of "used to be young" that's "used to be fun" about tech jobs

That would be hilarious! A parody of *"Used to Be Young"* turning into *"Used to Be Fun"* would definitely resonate with a lot of folks who’ve seen tech culture evolve over the years. You could play with themes like the shift from exciting innovation to burnout, or from fun, quirky startup vibes to rigid, deadline-heavy corporate environments. Maybe something like:

> "I used to hack all night / Now I dread the Slack ping's light / We used to dream, now we're runnin' sprints / I used to be fun, but I don’t know where it went..."

There's so much comedic potential in contrasting the wide-eyed optimism of the early tech days with the more jaded reality!

Come up with lyrics for this

Sure! Here’s a fun take on *"Used to Be Fun"* for a tech job parody:

---

**"Used to Be Fun" (to the tune of "Used to Be Young")**

*(Verse 1)*  
We used to break the code, rewrite it just for laughs,  
Now we chase the deadlines, burn out on the graph.  
Remember all-nighters, fueled by Red Bull,  
Now it’s meetings on meetings, man, this grind is cruel.  

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
I remember the hype and the way we’d feel,  
Free food, ping-pong, the perks were real.  
But now it's all about KPIs,  
Pushing features with tired eyes.  

*(Chorus)*  
I used to be fun, we used to take risks,  
Now it’s all JIRA tickets and metrics we miss.  
We used to dream big, now we sprint to the sun,  
I used to love this, I used to be fun.  

*(Verse 2)*  
We built things from nothing, stayed up just for the thrill,  
Now I push PRs, wonder when I lost that chill.  
From hackathons to endless code reviews,  
I miss the days we’d break stuff, without paying dues.  

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
Stand-ups that once were a chance to shine,  
Now it’s just status updates, falling behind.  
All the coffee can’t bring back the spark,  
Now it’s burnouts and deadlines, the vibe's gone dark.  

*(Chorus)*  
I used to be fun, we used to take risks,  
Now it’s all JIRA tickets and metrics we miss.  
We used to dream big, now we sprint to the sun,  
I used to love this, I used to be fun.  

*(Bridge)*  
I scroll through my calendar, it’s full of dread,  
Where did the hackathons go, the dreams in my head?  
The office parties are just Zoom calls now,  
I miss the days when we broke stuff and wowed.  

*(Chorus)*  
I used to be fun, we used to break rules,  
Now we’re optimizing pipelines, feeling like fools.  
We used to dream big, now we sprint to the sun,  
I used to love this, I used to be fun.  

*(Outro)*  
Yeah, I used to be fun…  
We all used to be fun…

This parody captures that journey from the golden days of tech culture to the more serious, business-driven environment of today. Wouldn't it be great to share this at a tech company event?

Create a version that more closely conforms to the structure of the lyrics of used to be young

### Assistant - 2024-09-25 08:42:59

Absolutely! Here’s a version of *"Used to Be Fun"* that mirrors the structure of Miley Cyrus' *"Used to Be Young"* more closely:

---

**"Used to Be Fun"**  
*(Parody of Miley Cyrus' "Used to Be Young")*

*(Verse 1)*  
We used to build all night, stay up just for the thrill,  
Now it’s deadlines we fight, pushing bugs up the hill.  
The stand-ups used to shine, now they're dragging me down,  
It’s not what it was back then, the fun’s nowhere to be found.

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
I know I’ve changed, yeah, I’m not the same,  
Late nights of coding don’t light the flame.  
We used to break things just for fun,  
But now it’s all about version one.

*(Chorus)*  
I know I used to be fun,  
I know I used to have dreams.  
But now it’s sprint after sprint,  
In this endless machine.  
We used to break all the rules,  
Back when we just had begun.  
You say I’m jaded now,  
But I used to be fun.

*(Verse 2)*  
Hackathons on the floor, coffee fueling the day,  
Now we push to the cloud, but the joy slipped away.  
The ping-pong's gathering dust, the snacks don’t feel the same,  
It’s a grind, no matter what, this tech world's changed its game.

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
We chased the dream, built it up so high,  
But now it’s meetings that blur the sky.  
We used to crash servers, just for kicks,  
Now it's all about fixing the bugs in six.

*(Chorus)*  
I know I used to be fun,  
I know I used to have dreams.  
But now it’s sprint after sprint,  
In this endless machine.  
We used to break all the rules,  
Back when we just had begun.  
You say I’m jaded now,  
But I used to be fun.

*(Bridge)*  
It’s okay, I know I’ve changed,  
The passion’s there but rearranged.  
Maybe someday we’ll feel it again,  
But for now, it’s just deadlines we fend.

*(Chorus - Outro)*  
I know I used to be fun,  
I know I used to have dreams.  
But now it’s sprint after sprint,  
In this endless machine.  
We used to break all the rules,  
Back when we just had begun.  
You say I’m jaded now,  
But I used to be fun…  
Yeah, I used to be fun.

This version aligns more closely with the lyrical structure of Miley Cyrus' song, with similar phrasing and repetition in the chorus and bridge, but adapted to reflect the shift from the fun, exploratory days in tech to the more grind-heavy reality.
