You are generating a prompt for a generative AI image generator. The image you want do describe should be a cylinder, like those used for representing databases in software architecture diagrams, with three arrows, like in a vector diagram, inside of it.

Create an image of a 3D cylinder, similar to those used in software architecture diagrams to represent databases. Inside the cylinder, include three arrows arranged like a vector diagram, with each arrow pointing in different directions to symbolize data flow or relationships within the database. The image should be clear and visually appealing, suitable for use in presentations or documentation.
