It seems the specific query on "good, bad, and mediocre people management" isn't directly addressed in the FLUX Review from the uploaded file. However, based on the overarching themes from FLUX, here’s a synthesis that aligns with its systems thinking and organizational dynamics:

- **Good People Management**: Likely seen as fostering environments where autonomy, purpose, and systems thinking are prioritized. A good manager in FLUX terms would focus on enabling teams to understand their role in the broader system, promoting a culture of continuous feedback and adaptability. This includes balancing task management with a deep sense of relational management—seeing employees not just as resources but as complex actors within a system.

- **Bad People Management**: Bad management would likely focus on rigidity, a lack of communication, and poor systems understanding. Managers who prioritize top-down control without appreciating the interconnectedness of roles, and those who fail to recognize or adapt to systemic feedback loops (e.g., burnout, low morale), would fall under this category. The FLUX lens would criticize managers who treat people management as a purely transactional, linear process.

- **Mediocre People Management**: This might be defined as managers who perform the basic functions but lack the systems-level perspective that FLUX emphasizes. These managers get tasks done, but they don't contribute to the long-term evolution of the team or organization. They manage in a way that maintains the status quo but lacks the transformational or adaptive qualities that FLUX advocates for.

If you'd like, I can look into more specific FLUX concepts or examples that could expand on these insights!

To craft a set of recommendations for good people management in software engineering, we can apply the FLUX principles of systems thinking, adaptability, and human-centric management. While these are broad concepts, they can be effectively adapted to the unique challenges and dynamics of engineering teams. Here’s a set of FLUX-aligned recommendations:

### 1. **Foster a Systems Mindset in the Team**
   Encourage engineers to understand their work within the broader system of the organization and the market. This means:
   - **End-to-End Awareness**: Help your team see how their code contributes to the overall product and user experience. This fosters a sense of purpose and ownership.
   - **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Facilitate interactions between engineers, product managers, and other departments. A systems thinker doesn’t work in isolation; they engage with other nodes in the network to create more resilient, adaptable solutions.

   **Recommendation**: Regularly hold cross-departmental meetings and reviews where engineers can learn how their work influences and is influenced by other parts of the organization.

### 2. **Encourage Autonomy, But With Clear Alignment**
   Autonomy is key to creativity, especially in engineering. However, it’s crucial to ensure that individual goals align with organizational priorities.
   - **Define Clear Objectives**: Use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or similar frameworks to align autonomy with the system’s goals. This allows engineers the freedom to innovate while staying within strategically aligned guardrails.
   - **Trust and Delegate**: Trust your team to manage their own time and make technical decisions. Avoid micromanagement but stay available for support.

   **Recommendation**: Establish a framework for decision-making that empowers engineers but ties their choices back to system-level goals (e.g., performance metrics, user experience improvements).

### 3. **Design for Adaptability Over Perfection**
   FLUX emphasizes the need for flexibility in systems—good people management reflects this in how it supports ongoing learning and adaptability.
   - **Iterative Development**: Encourage iterative design and agile methods, where "good enough" solutions are quickly tested, iterated, and improved based on feedback. This reduces the pressure for perfection in the initial stages and aligns with rapid change.
   - **Learning Culture**: Build a culture that treats mistakes and failures as learning opportunities. This creates psychological safety and fosters growth.

   **Recommendation**: Hold regular retrospectives not just to assess product outcomes but to assess team dynamics and adaptability—what did the team learn, and how can they improve?

### 4. **Focus on Relational Management, Not Just Task Management**
   According to FLUX’s principles, effective management isn’t just about hitting KPIs but building relationships and trust within the team. Good people management nurtures a sense of belonging and personal growth.
   - **Active Listening and Feedback**: Implement a continuous feedback loop where both positive and constructive feedback flows freely. This helps engineers feel heard and valued.
   - **Empathy-Driven Leadership**: Understand individual motivations and career goals, and tailor your management approach accordingly. Acknowledge both the human and professional sides of your team.

   **Recommendation**: Set up one-on-one meetings focused not just on project status, but on personal development, challenges, and well-being.

### 5. **Support Continuous Learning and Skill Development**
   FLUX emphasizes adaptability, and in a technical field like software engineering, continuous learning is key to keeping teams relevant and innovative.
   - **Access to Resources**: Ensure engineers have access to the latest technologies, tools, and learning platforms. Whether it’s through formal training programs or informal coding sprints, encourage them to sharpen their skills.
   - **Time for Innovation**: Dedicate time for engineers to work on side projects or experimental technologies. This fosters creativity and helps the team stay on the cutting edge.

   **Recommendation**: Implement a “20% time” policy or similar initiatives where engineers can dedicate time to learning new skills or experimenting with new tools and technologies.

### 6. **Use Feedback Loops to Drive Improvement**
   FLUX emphasizes the importance of feedback loops in systems. A well-managed team thrives on constant iteration and reflection, just as an engineering project does.
   - **Internal Feedback Mechanisms**: Have regular check-ins and retrospectives to adjust workflows, identify bottlenecks, and fine-tune processes.
   - **External Feedback**: Push for rapid, frequent feedback from end users and stakeholders to ensure the team is building solutions that align with user needs and system-level goals.

   **Recommendation**: Integrate customer or user feedback into your sprint cycles, making it part of the team's routine to assess whether their work meets real-world needs.

### 7. **Cultivate Resilience and Well-Being**
   Engineers often face tight deadlines and high-stakes projects. Management must support resilience not only in the technical systems they build but in the people who build them.
   - **Work-Life Balance**: Recognize the limits of team capacity and ensure sustainable workloads. Preventing burnout leads to better long-term performance and innovation.
   - **Mental Health Support**: Offer support for mental health and well-being, whether through resources, flexible work arrangements, or creating a supportive culture where taking breaks is normalized.

   **Recommendation**: Introduce “downtime weeks” post-deployment, where engineers can focus on light projects, refactoring, or learning instead of high-pressure tasks.

---

### Conclusion
Good people management in a software engineering context, when viewed through the lens of FLUX, isn’t just about delivering on time or hitting code targets. It’s about fostering a system in which engineers understand their broader purpose, feel empowered to adapt and innovate, and are supported both professionally and personally. By implementing these recommendations, you can align the dynamic, ever-evolving world of software development with human-centric, adaptive management that thrives on feedback and continuous improvement.

Modify this for a high pressure startup context where managers need to focus on getting things done while also growing people, keeping them from burning out, building effective collaboration across teams. This is a culture where the key values are showing love for the customer, open and transparent communication, winning together as a team, and individuals being high agency. Put particular emphasis on the high agency. Bit, emphasizing that it is not the manager's job to do things for people, but rather make sure that people know what to do and are empowered to do it

In a high-pressure startup context where the focus is on delivering results rapidly while growing individuals, avoiding burnout, and fostering effective collaboration, the approach to people management needs to balance urgency with empowerment. This becomes especially important in a culture that values customer focus, transparency, teamwork, and high agency. Below is a set of recommendations tailored to such an environment, emphasizing the FLUX idea that systems thrive when individuals are empowered, but connected to the larger organizational goals.

### 1. **Enable High Agency Without Hand-Holding**
   High agency means that team members take initiative, solve problems, and drive outcomes autonomously. The manager’s role isn’t to do things for people but to ensure they know what needs to be done and that they have the resources and authority to act.
   - **Clarify Vision and Goals**: Ensure every engineer understands the high-level business objectives and how their work impacts customer outcomes. This clarity is the foundation for agency—when people understand the “why,” they can make better autonomous decisions on the “how.”
   - **Decentralized Decision-Making**: Create clear boundaries for decision-making. Managers should empower team members to own technical and operational decisions within their domain, stepping in only for strategic alignment or major decisions.
   
   **Recommendation**: Use frameworks like RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) to clearly define decision-making roles. Hold kickoff meetings for projects where expectations and boundaries are set, then let individuals take full ownership.

### 2. **Drive Accountability Through Radical Transparency**
   In a fast-paced startup, open and transparent communication ensures that teams remain aligned without constant oversight. Transparency also reinforces a sense of shared ownership over outcomes.
   - **Make Progress Visible**: Implement tools and practices that make progress and blockers visible to everyone. Kanban boards, regular updates, and daily standups help teams stay aligned without micromanaging.
   - **Give and Receive Open Feedback**: Build a culture where feedback is freely given and received. Transparent feedback loops are essential not only for improving work quality but also for keeping morale high and preventing burnout.

   **Recommendation**: Incorporate regular “feedback Fridays” or other rituals where the team openly shares what went well and where improvements can be made, ensuring that communication is part of the team’s DNA.

### 3. **Prioritize Customer Outcomes Over Process**
   In this high-pressure startup environment, the customer’s needs should be the compass for every decision. Good people management means tying individual work directly to customer outcomes and reducing bureaucracy that slows the team down.
   - **Customer-Centric Decision Making**: Empower engineers to make decisions by evaluating their impact on the customer. When trade-offs are required, prioritize work that directly benefits the end-user or speeds up feedback loops.
   - **Keep Iterations Short**: Create space for rapid deployment and testing, with customer feedback driving the next sprint’s priorities. This both serves the customer and gives engineers a clear purpose, fueling motivation.

   **Recommendation**: Create a direct feedback channel between the customer-facing teams (support, sales) and engineering, ensuring engineers hear firsthand how their work impacts customers, further driving motivation and focus.

### 4. **Foster Team Ownership and 'Winning Together'**
   Startups thrive on collective success, and people management in this context must emphasize team achievement over individual heroics. High agency doesn’t mean isolation; it means collaboration with purpose.
   - **Shared Goals, Distributed Efforts**: Align the team around shared outcomes, but distribute responsibilities across individuals who are fully empowered to deliver on their pieces. This ensures people don’t wait for top-down directives but move toward a shared vision.
   - **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Facilitate open forums (e.g., daily stand-ups or sprint planning) where team members can raise challenges and propose solutions together. Cross-team collaboration ensures that no one is bottlenecked, and ideas can be pooled to tackle complex problems.

   **Recommendation**: In sprint planning, frame objectives as team goals with clearly assigned tasks but allow flexibility for individuals to help others. When teams feel collective responsibility for success, they’ll naturally pull together.

### 5. **Guard Against Burnout with Focused Work and Regular Wins**
   Burnout is a major risk in high-pressure environments. Managers must help their teams sustain high performance by setting clear, achievable targets and celebrating progress, all while maintaining flexibility.
   - **Focused, Prioritized Work**: Help your team avoid the trap of endless task lists by focusing on high-impact, customer-centric tasks. Reduce distractions and low-priority work by clearly prioritizing key outcomes in each sprint or project cycle.
   - **Small Wins, Big Momentum**: Build a cadence of small victories. Celebrate each achievement to reinforce a culture of winning together. This keeps morale high, even when pressure mounts.

   **Recommendation**: Hold weekly or biweekly "Demo Days" where the team showcases progress. Celebrate each success—no matter how small—to keep the energy up and the team focused on continuous improvement.

### 6. **Support High Agency with Learning and Growth Opportunities**
   To sustain high agency, people must constantly grow and refine their skill sets. However, in a startup, time is scarce, so managers must integrate learning into the flow of work.
   - **On-the-Job Learning**: Encourage engineers to learn through experimentation and problem-solving. High agency often comes with taking on tasks outside of one's immediate comfort zone—make this a natural part of the culture.
   - **Coaching Over Directing**: Instead of giving step-by-step instructions, act as a coach. Ask questions, provide resources, and offer context that helps individuals figure things out themselves. This supports autonomy and growth.

   **Recommendation**: Pair junior engineers with senior team members for project-based mentorship, ensuring they are solving real problems while also receiving guidance and learning on the job.

### 7. **Balance Speed with Sustainability**
   Startups are all about speed, but long-term success requires building systems—and teams—that can sustain high velocity without collapsing under pressure.
   - **Push for Efficiency, Not Perfection**: Encourage a mindset of getting things done well enough to deliver value quickly, but not perfect. Perfectionism leads to delays and burnout, whereas efficient work cycles create space for iteration and improvement.
   - **Adapt and Adjust Quickly**: Keep workflows fluid enough to adapt when priorities shift, but structured enough that engineers aren’t working in chaos. Maintain balance by regularly assessing processes and adjusting them as needed.

   **Recommendation**: Introduce bi-weekly process retrospectives focused not just on technical performance, but on team health and sustainability. Ask the team how processes can be improved for speed *and* well-being.

---

### Conclusion
In a high-pressure startup, good people management revolves around empowering individuals to operate with high agency while keeping a relentless focus on customer outcomes, team collaboration, and transparent communication. Managers should not be doing the work for their teams, but rather setting up the environment where individuals are fully empowered to act autonomously, solve problems, and contribute meaningfully to the startup's success—all while preventing burnout.

**Good Manager, Bad Manager: The High-Agency Playbook for Startups**

In a high-pressure startup, a good manager isn’t just someone who can lead a team to meet deadlines. A good manager is someone who can foster autonomy, empower individuals to act with high agency, and create a culture where people not only *get things done* but grow while doing it. A bad manager, on the other hand, either micromanages their team into exhaustion or abdicates responsibility, leaving them lost without direction. The difference between the two often comes down to one critical trait: understanding the balance between control and empowerment.

### The Bad Manager: A Fixer or a Phantom

Let’s start with the bad manager. Bad managers tend to fall into one of two camps: the **fixer** or the **phantom**.

The **fixer** believes that their value lies in solving problems for the team. They step in at every turn, providing detailed instructions, constantly tweaking processes, and often doing the work themselves. At first glance, this might seem like a form of high involvement—after all, the fixer is always in the trenches. But here’s the catch: while fixers may get short-term results, they leave their team dependent and disempowered. Team members stop thinking for themselves because they know the fixer will come in and “save the day.” High agency dies a slow death under this kind of management, and with it, the creativity and initiative that startups thrive on.

The **phantom** is the opposite. They assume that autonomy means being completely hands-off. They provide little direction, rarely check in, and assume that high agency will naturally lead to results. The team is left to navigate without a map. While this approach might sound appealing to seasoned professionals, it often leads to misalignment, confusion, and a lack of accountability. Phantom managers create an environment where people are “autonomous” in theory, but in practice, they are isolated and unsupported.

Both of these bad management styles fail to understand the nuances of high agency. The fixer strips away autonomy, while the phantom abandons responsibility.

### The Good Manager: Coach, Not a Hero

The good manager, by contrast, understands that their job is not to solve every problem, but to create the conditions where individuals are empowered to solve problems themselves. The good manager is not a hero; they are a **coach**. They guide without taking over, step back without disappearing, and ensure their team knows both the destination and how to get there.

Here’s how good managers build high-agency teams while avoiding the traps of over-control and under-support.

### 1. **They Clarify the Vision but Trust the Team to Execute**

Good managers don’t micromanage. They start by clearly defining the objectives and how these align with the company’s goals, especially when it comes to serving the customer. In a startup where urgency is paramount, every decision must be made with the end user in mind. A good manager ensures that every engineer understands the impact of their work on the customer experience. This focus on outcomes gives team members the context they need to make decisions autonomously.

But here’s the key: once the goals are clear, the manager steps back. They let the team figure out the “how.” When engineers know *what* needs to be done and *why*, they are empowered to choose the best methods and tools for getting there. This is where high agency thrives—people feel ownership over the process and the results.

Bad managers, by contrast, either hover over every step (the fixer) or fail to set clear goals, leaving the team unsure of their purpose (the phantom).

### 2. **They Build Transparency and Accountability into the System**

A good manager doesn’t need to micromanage because they’ve built a system where transparency and accountability happen naturally. Tools like Kanban boards, daily standups, and open forums make progress visible to everyone. This isn’t about surveillance; it’s about creating a culture of radical transparency where team members can see both individual and collective progress.

In this environment, feedback is constant and candid. Good managers encourage open dialogue, where both successes and failures are discussed without judgment. This keeps the team aligned and prevents small problems from turning into big ones. It also ensures that individuals can self-correct and adjust their approach without waiting for managerial intervention.

Bad managers, by contrast, either try to control everything or leave teams to operate in silos, with little visibility into what others are doing. In both cases, communication breaks down and accountability erodes.

### 3. **They Balance Speed with Sustainability**

In a high-pressure startup, the need for speed is real. But good managers understand that speed without sustainability leads to burnout. While bad managers either drive the team into the ground with relentless deadlines or lose momentum by allowing disorganized chaos, good managers find the sweet spot: they push for efficiency without sacrificing the long-term well-being of their team.

Good managers prioritize customer outcomes and focus on high-impact tasks that deliver value quickly. But they also recognize that their team’s energy is a finite resource. They keep a close eye on workload and stress levels, ensuring that engineers aren’t burning out in pursuit of short-term goals. Regular retrospectives and process improvements help the team stay fast and agile, without becoming overwhelmed.

Bad managers, on the other hand, are often either reckless or complacent. They push too hard without regard for sustainability, or they allow inefficiencies to fester because they don’t want to disrupt the team. Neither approach works in the long run.

### 4. **They Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

The most important skill of a good manager is the ability to ask the right questions. When an engineer comes to them with a problem, the bad manager either gives the solution (the fixer) or dismisses the issue (the phantom). The good manager, however, asks questions that help the engineer think through the problem themselves. “What do you think the best solution is?” “How do you plan to approach this?” “What impact will this have on the customer?”

By asking rather than telling, the manager encourages ownership. The team learns to solve problems independently, which is the essence of high agency. At the same time, the manager is available to provide guidance when needed, ensuring that the team is aligned and supported without being micromanaged.

Good managers also focus on developing their team’s decision-making skills. They provide the resources and context that help individuals grow, without taking away their autonomy. This is especially important in a startup where learning on the job is a constant reality.

### 5. **They Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Good managers know that startups are a rollercoaster, with high highs and low lows. To keep the team motivated and resilient, they make a point of celebrating every win, no matter how small. Whether it’s a successful deployment, a bug fix, or positive feedback from a customer, these moments reinforce the sense of progress and achievement.

But more importantly, good managers build resilience into their team’s culture. They recognize that failure is part of the process and encourage their team to view setbacks as learning opportunities. By framing failure as feedback, good managers keep their team from becoming discouraged when things go wrong.

Bad managers, on the other hand, either downplay successes in pursuit of the next big goal or punish failure, creating a fear-based culture where risk-taking is avoided.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

In a high-pressure startup, the good manager strikes the perfect balance between guidance and autonomy. They clarify the vision, build a culture of transparency, and empower their team to take ownership of the work. They ask questions instead of giving answers, and they create an environment where high agency can thrive without burning people out. In doing so, they turn a group of engineers into a high-performing team that delivers results—and grows in the process.

The bad manager either takes too much control or abandons their team to figure things out on their own. They fail to understand that the real power of high agency comes not from letting go completely, but from creating the conditions where individuals feel both empowered and supported.

In the end, the good manager understands that it’s not their job to be the hero. It’s their job to build heroes.

They let the team figure out the “how.” When engineers know *what* needs to be done and *why*, they are empowered to choose the best methods and tools for getting there. This is where high agency thrives—people feel ownership over the process and the results.

Techniques for this:
- **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** to give clarity on goals without dictating how to achieve them.
- **Decision-making frameworks** like RACI, so everyone knows who is responsible for what.
- **Regular kickoff meetings** where goals are laid out, but execution is left to the team.

Bad managers, by contrast, either hover over every step (the fixer) or fail to set clear goals, leaving the team unsure of their purpose (the phantom).

### 2. **They Build Transparency and Accountability into the System**

It also ensures that individuals can self-correct and adjust their approach without waiting for managerial intervention.

Techniques for this:
- **Daily standups** to surface blockers early and keep everyone aligned on progress.
- **Kanban or other visual project boards** to track progress transparently.
- **Weekly retrospectives** where feedback loops are formalized, and team members openly discuss what’s working and what isn’t.

Bad managers, by contrast, either try to control everything or leave teams to operate in silos, with little visibility into what others are doing. In both cases, communication breaks down and accountability erodes.

### 3. **They Balance Speed with Sustainability**

In a high-pressure startup, the need for speed is real. But good managers understand that speed without sustainability leads to burnout. While bad managers either drive the team into the ground with relentless deadlines or lose momentum by allowing disorganized chaos, good managers find the sweet spot: they push for efficiency without sacrificing the long-term well-being of their team.

Good managers prioritize customer outcomes and focus on high-impact tasks that deliver value quickly. But they also recognize that their team’s energy is a finite resource. They keep a close eye on workload and stress levels, ensuring that engineers aren’t burning out in pursuit of short-term goals. Regular retrospectives and process improvements help the team stay fast and agile, without becoming overwhelmed.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning sessions** focused on high-impact, high-priority tasks that deliver immediate value.
- **Downtime weeks or flexible time for lower-pressure work** after big pushes to avoid burnout.
- **Workload tracking** to ensure no one is overloaded, combined with open dialogues on capacity during retrospectives.

Bad managers, on the other hand, are often either reckless or complacent. They push too hard without regard for sustainability, or they allow inefficiencies to fester because they don’t want to disrupt the team. Neither approach works in the long run.

### 4. **They Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

The most important skill of a good manager is the ability to ask the right questions. When an engineer comes to them with a problem, the bad manager either gives the solution (the fixer) or dismisses the issue (the phantom).

By asking rather than telling, the manager encourages ownership. The team learns to solve problems independently, which is the essence of high agency. At the same time, the manager is available to provide guidance when needed, ensuring that the team is aligned and supported without being micromanaged.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching sessions** focused on guiding team members to come up with solutions themselves.
- **Problem-solving frameworks** like the 5 Whys or Socratic questioning to encourage deeper thinking and exploration of root causes.
- **Decision-making templates** where individuals can outline their reasoning and approach before making big choices, ensuring alignment without directive interference.

Good managers also focus on developing their team’s decision-making skills. They provide the resources and context that help individuals grow, without taking away their autonomy. This is especially important in a startup where learning on the job is a constant reality.

### 5. **They Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Good managers know that startups are a rollercoaster, with high highs and low lows. To keep the team motivated and resilient, they make a point of celebrating every win, no matter how small. Whether it’s a successful deployment, a bug fix, or positive feedback from a customer, these moments reinforce the sense of progress and achievement.

But more importantly, good managers build resilience into their team’s culture. They recognize that failure is part of the process and encourage their team to view setbacks as learning opportunities. By framing failure as feedback, good managers keep their team from becoming discouraged when things go wrong.

Techniques for this:
- **Demo days** where teams share progress and celebrate wins, however small.
- **Failure retrospectives** where teams analyze what went wrong without blame, focusing on what can be learned for the future.
- **Public shoutouts or small rewards** for key milestones, reinforcing the culture of winning together.

Bad managers, on the other hand, either downplay successes in pursuit of the next big goal or punish failure, creating a fear-based culture where risk-taking is avoided.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

In a high-pressure startup, the good manager strikes the perfect balance between guidance and autonomy. They clarify the vision, build a culture of transparency, and empower their team to take ownership of the work. They ask questions instead of giving answers, and they create an environment where high agency can thrive without burning people out. In doing so, they turn a group of engineers into a high-performing team that delivers results—and grows in the process.

The bad manager either takes too much control or abandons their team to figure things out on their own. They fail to understand that the real power of high agency comes not from letting go completely, but from creating the conditions where individuals feel both empowered and supported.

In the end, the good manager understands that it’s not their job to be the hero. It’s their job to build heroes.

**Impactful Manager, Ineffective Manager: The High-Agency Playbook for Sourcegraph**

At Sourcegraph, the pressure to innovate and deliver is real, but so is the need to build a culture of autonomy, high agency, and sustainable growth. An impactful manager doesn’t just lead a team to meet deadlines—they foster ownership, empower individuals to take initiative, and create a culture where engineers grow while solving complex problems. An ineffective manager, by contrast, either micromanages the team into dependence or leaves them directionless. The difference often comes down to understanding how to balance guidance with empowerment.

### The Ineffective Manager: A Fixer or a Phantom

Ineffective managers tend to fall into one of two camps: the **fixer** or the **phantom**.

The **fixer** thinks their value lies in solving problems for the team. They step in at every roadblock, provide instructions, and often do the work themselves. While this might seem helpful in the short term, it strips engineers of their agency. Team members stop thinking for themselves because they know the fixer will eventually swoop in to “save the day.” Over time, the team becomes dependent, stifling the creativity and initiative Sourcegraph depends on to innovate.

The **phantom** is the opposite. They assume that autonomy means being completely hands-off. They provide little direction, rarely check in, and assume that high agency will naturally produce results. The team is left to navigate without a map. While this approach might work for very seasoned professionals, it often leads to misalignment, confusion, and a lack of accountability.

Both management styles undermine high agency: the fixer takes away autonomy, while the phantom leaves the team lost without direction.

### The Impactful Manager: Coach, Not a Hero

The impactful manager understands their role isn’t to solve every problem, but to create the conditions where engineers are empowered to solve problems themselves. They act as a **coach**, guiding without taking over, stepping back without disappearing, and ensuring the team knows both the destination and how to get there.

Here’s how impactful managers at Sourcegraph build high-agency teams while avoiding the traps of over-control and under-support.

### 1. **They Clarify the Vision but Trust the Team to Execute**

Impactful managers avoid micromanagement by clearly defining objectives that align with Sourcegraph’s goals—especially the goal of making the world’s code more accessible. Every decision must be made with the customer’s needs in mind. At Sourcegraph, the customer is both the developer and the organization relying on powerful code search and navigation capabilities. A good manager ensures that every engineer understands how their work contributes to solving the customer’s pain points.

But once the goals are set, the manager steps back. Engineers need room to figure out the “how.” When they understand *what* needs to be done and *why*, they are empowered to choose the best methods for getting there, fostering ownership over the process and results.

Techniques for this:
- **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** to give clarity on goals without dictating execution.
- **Decision-making frameworks** like RACI to clarify responsibilities while maintaining individual autonomy.
- **Kickoff meetings** where goals are outlined, and the execution plan is left to the team.

Ineffective managers, in contrast, either hover over every step (the fixer) or fail to provide clear direction, leaving the team unsure of their purpose (the phantom).

### 2. **They Build Transparency and Accountability into the System**

An impactful manager doesn’t need to micromanage because they’ve built a system where transparency and accountability happen naturally. Tools like Sourcegraph itself, along with Kanban boards and daily standups, make progress visible to everyone. This isn’t about oversight; it’s about creating a culture of transparency where engineers can see both individual and collective progress.

In this environment, feedback is constant and candid. Impactful managers foster a culture where successes and challenges are openly discussed. This ensures that individuals can course-correct without waiting for intervention and allows the team to stay aligned on the bigger picture.

Techniques for this:
- **Daily standups** to highlight blockers and keep everyone updated on progress.
- **Kanban boards** or similar visual tools to make work visible and shared.
- **Weekly retrospectives** to formalize feedback loops and discuss what’s working and what needs to improve.

Ineffective managers, on the other hand, either control everything or let teams operate in silos. This leads to poor communication and diminished accountability.

### 3. **They Balance Speed with Sustainability**

Sourcegraph thrives on speed, but impactful managers know that speed without sustainability leads to burnout. While ineffective managers either push teams too hard or let chaos reign, impactful managers find a balance between moving fast and keeping their teams healthy.

Impactful managers prioritize high-impact, customer-centered tasks that deliver immediate value. But they also keep an eye on their team’s workload to prevent burnout. Regular retrospectives and process improvements help maintain high velocity without overwhelming the team.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning sessions** that prioritize high-impact tasks delivering immediate customer value.
- **Downtime weeks** or flex time for less intense work after major releases.
- **Workload tracking** and open discussions on capacity during retrospectives.

Ineffective managers, by contrast, either drive the team too hard or allow inefficiencies to slow progress, resulting in frustration and exhaustion.

### 4. **They Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

The most critical skill of an impactful manager is the ability to ask the right questions. When an engineer presents a problem, the ineffective manager either provides a solution (the fixer) or brushes it off (the phantom). The impactful manager, however, asks questions to help the engineer work through the issue themselves. “What do you think is the best approach?” “How will this impact the customer?” “What are the trade-offs?”

By asking instead of telling, the manager encourages engineers to take ownership of their decisions. This promotes high agency—the team becomes adept at solving problems independently, with the manager acting as a guide rather than a fixer.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching sessions** focused on problem-solving through dialogue.
- **Problem-solving frameworks** like the 5 Whys or Socratic questioning to help engineers explore the root cause of issues.
- **Decision-making templates** where team members outline their reasoning and approach before making significant choices.

This method helps engineers grow without being dependent on the manager, ensuring long-term success and autonomy.

### 5. **They Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Impactful managers know that working at Sourcegraph can be a rollercoaster. To keep morale high and the team resilient, they celebrate every win, no matter how small. Whether it’s shipping a feature, fixing a bug, or hearing positive feedback from users, these celebrations reinforce progress and keep motivation strong.

But more importantly, impactful managers build resilience. They frame setbacks as learning opportunities rather than failures. By treating failure as feedback, they create a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement, where risks are embraced rather than avoided.

Techniques for this:
- **Demo days** where teams present their work and celebrate progress, creating momentum.
- **Failure retrospectives** that examine what went wrong, focusing on lessons learned rather than blame.
- **Public recognition** for key milestones, reinforcing the culture of collective success.

Ineffective managers, in contrast, either overlook these successes or punish failure, leading to a culture where risk-taking is stifled, and the team becomes risk-averse.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

At Sourcegraph, an impactful manager strikes the perfect balance between guiding and empowering their team. They clarify the vision, create systems for transparency, and encourage engineers to take ownership of their work. They ask the right questions, celebrate successes, and build resilience against setbacks. In doing so, they transform a group of individuals into a high-performing team that delivers results *and* grows through the process.

Ineffective managers either take too much control or leave their team to figure things out on their own. They misunderstand that true high agency doesn’t mean letting go entirely but creating the right conditions for individuals to thrive with the right amount of support.

In the end, the impactful manager knows their job isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build heroes.

### User - 2024-10-05 12:05:51

Work into the first principle for effective managers. Something about how we have too much to do and it all ideally would be done yesterday. So part of what an effective manager needs to do is prioritize. We are really good at starting work. We need to be just as good at finishing it and delivering that value to our customers, our users, and the business.

The impactful manager understands their role isn’t to solve every problem, but to create the conditions where engineers are empowered to solve problems themselves. They act as a **coach**, guiding without taking over, stepping back without disappearing, and ensuring the team knows both the destination and how to get there.

Here’s how impactful managers at Sourcegraph build high-agency teams while avoiding the traps of over-control and under-support.

### 1. **They Prioritize and Push for Delivery**

At Sourcegraph, there is always more work than time, and everything seems like it should’ve been done yesterday. An impactful manager knows that their team is great at starting work, but the real value comes from finishing it. In a fast-moving startup, it’s not enough to chase multiple tasks simultaneously—what matters is delivering finished work that brings value to customers, users, and the business. 

A manager’s role is to make tough decisions about priorities and help the team focus on what will have the greatest impact. In this high-agency environment, engineers need to know not only *what* to work on but also *when* it needs to be delivered to make the most difference.

But prioritization isn’t just about telling the team what’s important; it’s about empowering them to understand the value of their work in the bigger picture. Impactful managers ensure their engineers are not stuck in an endless cycle of starting new tasks—they are just as good at finishing and delivering real value.

Techniques for this:
- **Backlog grooming sessions** to consistently refine and prioritize tasks based on business value.
- **Timeboxing** sprints and setting clear deliverable deadlines so that work cycles end in tangible outcomes.
- **Progress tracking and regular check-ins** to ensure that the focus stays on completing high-priority tasks, not just starting new ones.

Ineffective managers either push the team in too many directions at once or allow them to get bogged down in less critical work, resulting in lots of motion but little delivery.

### 2. **They Clarify the Vision but Trust the Team to Execute**

Impactful managers avoid micromanagement by clearly defining objectives that align with Sourcegraph’s goals—especially the goal of making the world’s code more accessible. Every decision must be made with the customer’s needs in mind. At Sourcegraph, the customer is both the developer and the organization relying on powerful code search and navigation capabilities.

**Leading with Impact: How to Build Autonomous, High-Performing Engineering Teams at Sourcegraph**

At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time, and everything seems like it should’ve been done yesterday. An impactful manager doesn't just keep the team moving—they foster autonomy, empower individuals to take initiative, and ensure engineers deliver real value. An ineffective manager, by contrast, either micromanages the team into dependence or leaves them lost. The key difference? Knowing how to balance guidance with empowerment.

### The Ineffective Manager: Fixer or Phantom

Ineffective managers tend to fall into two categories: **fixers** or **phantoms**.

The **fixer** swoops in to solve problems, providing instructions or doing the work themselves. While this might get quick results, it undermines autonomy. Engineers stop thinking for themselves, knowing the fixer will handle it. Over time, creativity and initiative suffer.

The **phantom**, on the other hand, assumes autonomy means being hands-off. They rarely check in, leaving the team directionless. Engineers may have freedom, but without clear priorities or support, they often feel isolated and misaligned.

Both styles destroy high agency: fixers stifle it, and phantoms abandon it.

### The Impactful Manager: Coach, Not Hero

Impactful managers understand their job is to create conditions where engineers solve problems independently. They act as **coaches**, guiding without taking over. They balance autonomy with support, ensuring the team knows the destination and how to get there.

Here’s how impactful managers at Sourcegraph build high-agency, high-performing teams.

### 1. **Prioritize and Push for Delivery**

At Sourcegraph, we’re great at starting work, but the real impact comes from *finishing* it. Impactful managers know that prioritization is critical. It’s not enough to start multiple tasks—managers need to help the team focus on what will deliver the most value to customers, users, and the business.

An impactful manager ensures that engineers understand not only *what* to work on but also *when* it needs to be delivered. They encourage finishing work and delivering results, not just initiating new projects.

Techniques for this:
- **Backlog grooming** to refine and prioritize based on business impact.
- **Timeboxing** sprints to keep focus on deliverables.
- **Regular check-ins** to ensure focus on completing high-priority tasks.

Ineffective managers either let the team chase too many tasks or fail to set priorities, resulting in lots of effort but little output.

### 2. **Clarify the Vision, Trust the Team to Execute**

Impactful managers set clear objectives that align with Sourcegraph’s mission to make the world’s code accessible. They connect the team’s work to customer outcomes, ensuring engineers understand the bigger picture.

Once the vision is clear, they step back and trust the team to execute. Engineers are empowered to determine the *how*, taking ownership of their work and driving it forward autonomously.

Techniques for this:
- **OKRs** to provide clarity without micromanagement.
- **Decision-making frameworks** like RACI to assign responsibility while preserving autonomy.
- **Kickoff meetings** to define objectives but leave execution to the team.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving the team unsure of its purpose.

### 3. **Build Transparency and Accountability**

Impactful managers create systems where transparency and accountability are natural. Tools like Kanban boards, Sourcegraph itself, and daily standups ensure everyone can see progress and address blockers quickly.

Feedback flows freely. Impactful managers foster a culture where successes and challenges are openly discussed, allowing the team to adjust in real time.

Techniques for this:
- **Daily standups** to surface blockers early and keep the team aligned.
- **Kanban boards** to make work visible.
- **Weekly retrospectives** to formalize feedback and drive improvements.

Ineffective managers either control everything or let teams operate in silos, leading to misalignment and poor communication.

### 4. **Balance Speed with Sustainability**

Sourcegraph moves fast, but speed without sustainability leads to burnout. Impactful managers strike a balance: they push for efficiency, but they also monitor workload to prevent exhaustion. Regular retrospectives help the team maintain speed without sacrificing well-being.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning** that prioritizes high-impact tasks.
- **Downtime or flex time** after big pushes to recover.
- **Workload tracking** to prevent overload.

Ineffective managers either push too hard or allow inefficiency to slow down progress.

### 5. **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

The most critical skill of an impactful manager is asking the right questions. When an engineer encounters a problem, an ineffective manager either fixes it themselves or ignores it. An impactful manager asks questions that guide the engineer to solve it.

By asking instead of telling, impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, build problem-solving skills, and develop autonomy.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching** focused on problem-solving.
- **Frameworks** like the 5 Whys or Socratic questioning.
- **Decision-making templates** where engineers outline their reasoning before acting.

This builds problem-solving capabilities and keeps the team autonomous.

### 6. **Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Impactful managers understand that Sourcegraph can be a rollercoaster. They celebrate every win, no matter how small. Regular recognition reinforces progress and keeps motivation high.

But resilience is just as important. Impactful managers frame failure as feedback, encouraging experimentation and learning from setbacks.

Techniques for this:
- **Demo days** to showcase progress and celebrate wins.
- **Failure retrospectives** to focus on learning without blame.
- **Public recognition** of milestones to reinforce team achievements.

Ineffective managers either ignore these opportunities or punish failure, creating fear-based teams where risk-taking is avoided.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers know that balancing guidance and autonomy is key. They prioritize effectively, push for delivery, foster transparency, and empower engineers to own their work. By celebrating successes and learning from failures, they help their teams thrive in a high-agency environment.

In contrast, ineffective managers either take too much control or abandon their teams to figure things out alone. They miss the balance that allows autonomy to flourish within supportive frameworks.

Ultimately, the job of an impactful manager isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build heroes.

Modified the section about speed and sustainability to include some discussion of building high quality software that allows the team to move faster over time without slowing them down too much in the presence. The rule of thumb is that approximately 25% of the time on any project should be spent on velocity investments including the required testing and documentation, but also leaving room for cleanup and refactorings. Teams can also create dedicated cleanup projects when they identify hot spots that cause a lot of maintenance or where development is slow, challenging, or error prone

- **OKRs** to provide clarity without micromanagement.
- **Decision-making frameworks** like RACI to assign responsibility while preserving autonomy.
- **Kickoff meetings** to define objectives but leave execution to the team.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving the team unsure of its purpose.

### 3. **Build Transparency and Accountability**

Impactful managers create systems where transparency and accountability are natural. Tools like Sourcegraph itself, Kanban boards, and daily standups ensure everyone can see progress and address blockers quickly.

Feedback flows freely. Impactful managers foster a culture where successes and challenges are openly discussed, allowing the team to adjust in real time.

Techniques for this:
- **Daily standups** to surface blockers early and keep the team aligned.
- **Kanban boards** to make work visible.
- **Weekly retrospectives** to formalize feedback and drive improvements.

Ineffective managers either control everything or let teams operate in silos, leading to misalignment and poor communication.

### 4. **Balance Speed with Sustainability—and Build for Long-Term Velocity**

Sourcegraph moves fast, but speed without sustainability leads to burnout and technical debt. Impactful managers know that to maintain high velocity over time, the team must invest in software quality—without sacrificing short-term speed.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of the time in any project to **velocity investments**—efforts that make future development faster and smoother. This includes writing necessary tests and documentation, as well as cleanup and refactoring. By making small quality improvements regularly, the team can avoid being slowed down by technical debt in the future.

In addition to ongoing improvements, impactful managers help teams identify hotspots in the codebase where development is slow, error-prone, or challenging. These areas can be tackled in **dedicated cleanup projects** to reduce long-term friction.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning** that dedicates 25% of time to testing, refactoring, and documentation.
- **Tracking hotspots** in the code that slow development, using cleanup projects to address recurring issues.
- **Post-release downtime** for velocity investments like refactoring or tech debt reduction.

Ineffective managers either push too hard for short-term speed, creating unsustainable technical debt, or fail to recognize when technical investments are necessary, leading to slower development over time.

### 5. **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

The most critical skill of an impactful manager is asking the right questions. When an engineer encounters a problem, an ineffective manager either fixes it themselves or ignores it. An impactful manager asks questions that guide the engineer to solve it.

By asking instead of telling, impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, build problem-solving skills, and develop autonomy.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching** focused on problem-solving.
- **Frameworks** like the 5 Whys or Socratic questioning.
- **Decision-making templates** where engineers outline their reasoning before acting.

This builds problem-solving capabilities and keeps the team autonomous.

### 6. **Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Impactful managers understand that Sourcegraph can be a rollercoaster. They celebrate every win, no matter how small. Regular recognition reinforces progress and keeps motivation high.

But resilience is just as important. Impactful managers frame failure as feedback, encouraging experimentation and learning from setbacks.

Techniques for this:
- **Demo days** to showcase progress and celebrate wins.
- **Failure retrospectives** to focus on learning without blame.
- **Public recognition** of milestones to reinforce team achievements.

Ineffective managers either ignore these opportunities or punish failure, creating fear-based teams where risk-taking is avoided.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers know that balancing guidance and autonomy is key. They prioritize work effectively, push for delivery, foster transparency, and empower engineers to own their work. By celebrating successes and learning from failures, they help their teams thrive in a high-agency environment.

In contrast, ineffective managers either take too much control or abandon their teams to figure things out alone. They miss the balance that allows autonomy to flourish within supportive frameworks.

Ultimately, the job of an impactful manager isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build heroes.

**Leading with Impact: How to Build Autonomous, High-Performing Engineering Teams at Sourcegraph** 🚀

At Sourcegraph, we always have *way* more to do than time to do it! And let’s be real: everything seems like it should’ve been done yesterday. An impactful manager doesn’t just help the team keep moving—they inspire autonomy, give people the tools to take action, and ensure engineers deliver value where it counts. Ineffective managers? They either hover like helicopters 🛩️ or disappear like ghosts 👻. But the secret sauce is all about balance: a little guidance, a lot of empowerment.

### Ineffective Managers: Fixer vs. Phantom

Ineffective managers usually fall into one of two camps: **fixers** or **phantoms**.

The **fixer** rushes in to save the day, solving problems and dishing out instructions like it’s a superhero movie. While this might look productive, it actually makes engineers feel like they can’t do it on their own. Over time, their creativity and initiative take a nosedive 🛬.

The **phantom**, on the other hand, assumes autonomy means being totally hands-off. They’re rarely around, leaving the team wondering, “What should I focus on?” Engineers might have freedom, but without any direction or support, they often feel lost in the weeds.

Both of these approaches mess with high agency: fixers smother it, and phantoms neglect it.

### The Impactful Manager: Coach, Not Hero

Impactful managers know their job isn’t to be the hero. They’re **coaches**—the ones who guide without doing the work for you. They trust their team to make decisions, step in only when needed, and ensure everyone knows where the finish line is. 🎯

Here’s how an impactful manager at Sourcegraph builds an empowered, high-performing team:

### 1. **Prioritize and Push for Delivery** 🎯

At Sourcegraph, we’re *awesome*

**Leading with Impact: How to Build Autonomous, High-Performing Engineering Teams at Sourcegraph**

At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time, and it often feels like everything needed to be done yesterday! An impactful manager doesn’t just keep the team moving—they empower their engineers to take ownership, focus on what matters, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers, on the other hand, either micromanage or disappear. The key difference? Knowing when to guide and when to give space. It's all about finding that balance.

### Ineffective Managers: Fixers vs. Phantoms

Ineffective managers tend to fall into one of two categories: **fixers** or **phantoms**.

The **fixer** jumps in at every issue, solving problems themselves and giving step-by-step instructions. While this might seem helpful, it actually undermines autonomy. Engineers stop thinking for themselves, knowing the fixer will step in to save the day. Over time, their creativity and initiative take a hit.

The **phantom**, on the other hand, assumes autonomy means being entirely hands-off. They rarely check in, leaving the team to figure things out on their own. Engineers might have freedom, but without any guidance or support, they can easily become misaligned or lose focus.

Both approaches hurt high agency: fixers smother it, and phantoms neglect it.

### The Impactful Manager: Coach, Not Hero

Impactful managers understand their job isn’t to solve every problem themselves—it’s to create an environment where engineers can solve problems independently. They act as **coaches**, guiding without taking over, providing direction when needed, and ensuring the team understands both the goals and how to achieve them.

Here’s how impactful managers at Sourcegraph build high-agency, high-performing teams:

### 1. **Prioritize and Push for Delivery**

At Sourcegraph, we’re great at starting projects, but the real impact comes from finishing them. Impactful managers know that prioritization is critical. It’s not enough to juggle multiple tasks—managers need to help the team focus on what will deliver the most value to customers, users, and the business.

An impactful manager ensures that engineers understand not only *what* to work on but also *when* it needs to be delivered. The goal is to finish strong and get results, not just make progress on endless new projects.

Techniques for this:
- **Backlog grooming** to refine and prioritize tasks based on business impact.
- **Timeboxing** sprints to focus on deliverables.
- **Regular check-ins** to ensure progress on completing high-priority tasks.

Ineffective managers either allow the team to start too many things or fail to prioritize, leading to lots of activity but little output.

### 2. **Clarify the Vision, Trust the Team to Execute**

Impactful managers set clear objectives that align with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. They connect the team’s work to customer outcomes, making sure engineers understand how their contributions fit into the bigger picture.

Once the vision is clear, they trust the team to execute. Engineers are empowered to figure out *how* to achieve the goals, taking ownership of their work and driving it forward.

Techniques for this:
- **OKRs** to provide clarity without micromanagement.
- **Decision-making frameworks** like RACI to assign responsibility while preserving autonomy.
- **Kickoff meetings** to define objectives but leave execution to the team.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving the team unclear about their purpose.

### 3. **Build Transparency and Accountability**

Impactful managers create systems where transparency and accountability happen naturally. Tools like Sourcegraph itself, Kanban boards, and daily standups ensure everyone can see progress and address blockers quickly.

Feedback flows freely. Impactful managers foster a culture where successes and challenges are openly discussed, allowing the team to adjust in real time.

- **Kanban boards** to make work visible.
- **Weekly retrospectives** to formalize feedback and drive improvements.

Ineffective managers either control everything or let teams operate in silos, leading to poor communication and a lack of accountability.

### 4. **Balance Speed with Sustainability—And Build for Long-Term Velocity**

Sourcegraph moves fast, but speed without sustainability leads to burnout and technical debt. Impactful managers know that to maintain high velocity over time, the team must invest in software quality—without sacrificing short-term speed.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to **velocity investments**. This includes testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring—anything that helps the team move faster in the future. By making regular quality improvements, the team avoids being slowed down by technical debt later.

In addition to ongoing improvements, impactful managers help teams identify **hotspots** in the codebase where development is slow, error-prone, or difficult. These areas can be tackled through dedicated cleanup projects, reducing long-term friction and speeding up future work.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning** that dedicates 25% of time to velocity investments like refactoring and testing.
- **Tracking code hotspots** and using cleanup projects to address recurring issues.
- **Post-release downtime** for tech debt reduction and refactoring.

Ineffective managers either push too hard for immediate results, causing technical debt, or fail to prioritize technical investments, leading to slow development in the long run.

### 5. **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

One of the most critical skills of an impactful manager is knowing when to ask the right questions. When an engineer runs into a problem, ineffective managers either jump in and solve it or leave the issue unaddressed. Impactful managers ask questions to guide the engineer in finding their own solutions.

By asking instead of telling, impactful managers encourage engineers to take ownership, build their problem-solving skills, and grow more autonomous.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching** focused on helping engineers think through problems.
- **Problem-solving frameworks** like the 5 Whys or Socratic questioning.
- **Decision-making templates** where engineers outline their reasoning before acting.

This approach strengthens the team’s decision-making capabilities and fosters greater independence.

### 6. **Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Impactful managers know the ups and downs of working at Sourcegraph. To keep morale high and the team resilient, they celebrate every win—no matter how small. Regular recognition of achievements reinforces progress and keeps motivation strong.

But resilience is just as important. Impactful managers frame failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.

Techniques for this:
- **Demo days** where teams showcase progress and celebrate wins.
- **Failure retrospectives** to focus on lessons learned rather than blame.
- **Public recognition** of milestones to reinforce team achievements.

Ineffective managers either ignore these opportunities or punish failure, creating a fear-based environment where the team avoids risks.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers know the secret to success is balancing guidance with autonomy. They prioritize work effectively, push for delivery, and create systems for transparency. They empower engineers to own their work, celebrating successes and learning from failures to build a thriving, high-agency team.

In contrast, ineffective managers either take too much control or abandon their teams to figure things out on their own. They miss the balance that allows autonomy to flourish within a supportive framework.

Ultimately, the job of an impactful manager isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build heroes.

### User - 2024-10-05 12:25:06

Add something about collaboration. Engineering collaborates closely with product, design, TPM, technical success, and our marketing team. An impactful manager make sure that the right stakeholders are being brought in at the right time. They also act as a representative of an advocate for these complimentary perspectives especially when people from those parts of the company are not available to help.

Ineffective managers either allow the team to start too many things or fail to prioritize, leading to lots of activity but little output.

### 2. **Clarify the Vision, Trust the Team to Execute**

Impactful managers set clear objectives that align with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. They connect the team’s work to customer outcomes, making sure engineers understand how their contributions fit into the bigger picture.

Once the vision is clear, they trust the team to execute. Engineers are empowered to figure out *how* to achieve the goals, taking ownership of their work and driving it forward.

Techniques for this:
- **OKRs** to provide clarity without micromanagement.
- **Decision-making frameworks** like RACI to assign responsibility while preserving autonomy.
- **Kickoff meetings** to define objectives but leave execution to the team.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving the team unclear about their purpose.

### 3. **Build Transparency and Accountability**

Impactful managers create systems where transparency and accountability happen naturally. Tools like Sourcegraph itself, Kanban boards, and daily standups ensure everyone can see progress and address blockers quickly.

Feedback flows freely. Impactful managers foster a culture where successes and challenges are openly discussed, allowing the team to adjust in real time.

Techniques for this:
- **Daily standups** to surface blockers early and keep the team aligned.
- **Kanban boards** to make work visible.
- **Weekly retrospectives** to formalize feedback and drive improvements.

Ineffective managers either control everything or let teams operate in silos, leading to poor communication and a lack of accountability.

### 4. **Prioritize Speed—But Build for Long-Term Velocity**

At Sourcegraph, speed is everything. We need to move fast to stay competitive, but speed at the cost of sustainability will only slow us down in the long run. Impactful managers know that fast delivery isn’t just about shipping quickly today—it’s about creating the conditions for long-term velocity. And that means high-quality code.

We aspire to maintain a codebase that allows us to keep moving fast without being bogged down by technical debt. Engineers are expected to take ownership of the quality of their code, ensuring that their work not only meets the immediate need but also sets the team up for success down the road.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to **velocity investments**. This includes writing tests, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. These investments help ensure the codebase remains flexible and scalable, so the team can keep moving quickly in the future without being slowed down by legacy issues.

In addition to ongoing improvements, impactful managers encourage teams to identify **hotspots** in the codebase—areas where development is slow or prone to errors. These hotspots can then be addressed through dedicated cleanup projects, making future development smoother and faster.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning** that dedicates 25% of time to velocity investments like testing and refactoring.
- **Tracking code hotspots** and using cleanup projects to tackle recurring issues.
- **Post-release downtime** for technical debt reduction and refactoring.

Ineffective managers either focus too much on immediate delivery, ignoring technical debt, or fail to set clear expectations for quality, leading to a codebase that becomes harder to work with over time.

### 5. **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

One of the most critical skills of an impactful manager is knowing when to ask the right questions. When an engineer runs into a problem, ineffective managers either jump in and solve it or leave the issue unaddressed. Impactful managers ask questions to guide the engineer in finding their own solutions.

By asking instead of telling, impactful managers encourage engineers to take ownership, build their problem-solving skills, and grow more autonomous.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching** focused on helping engineers think through problems.
- **Problem-solving frameworks** like the 5 Whys or Socratic questioning.
- **Decision-making templates** where engineers outline their reasoning before acting.

This approach strengthens the team’s decision-making capabilities and fosters greater independence.

### 6. **Collaborate and Advocate for Stakeholders**

At Sourcegraph, collaboration is critical. Engineering teams don’t work in a vacuum—they work closely with product, design, technical program management (TPM), technical success, and even marketing. Impactful managers ensure the right stakeholders are brought in at the right time and that these different perspectives are considered throughout the project lifecycle.

When stakeholders aren’t available, impactful managers advocate for their perspectives, ensuring the team makes decisions that align with the broader company goals. They help bridge gaps between departments, making sure everyone is aligned and that complementary viewpoints are represented.

Techniques for this:
- **Cross-functional meetings** to ensure alignment with product, design, and other key teams.
- **Stakeholder check-ins** to confirm that perspectives from other departments are incorporated.
- **Acting as an advocate** for absent stakeholders, ensuring decisions reflect broader company goals.

### 7. **Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Impactful managers know the ups and downs of working at Sourcegraph. To keep morale high and the team resilient, they celebrate every win—no matter how small. Regular recognition of achievements reinforces progress and keeps motivation strong.

But resilience is just as important. Impactful managers frame failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.

Techniques for this:

- **Failure retrospectives** to focus on lessons learned rather than blame.
- **Public recognition** of milestones to reinforce team achievements.

Ineffective managers either ignore these opportunities or punish failure, creating a fear-based environment where the team avoids risks.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers know the secret to success is balancing guidance with autonomy. They prioritize work effectively, push for delivery, foster transparency, and empower engineers to own their work—both in terms of delivering results and maintaining a high-quality codebase. By celebrating successes, learning from failures, and collaborating across teams, they help build a thriving, high-agency environment.

In contrast, ineffective managers either take too much control or leave their teams to figure things out on their own. They miss the balance that allows autonomy to flourish within a supportive framework.

Ultimately, the job of an impactful manager isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build heroes.

**Leading with Impact: Building High-Performing Engineering Teams at Sourcegraph**

At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time, and it often feels like everything needed to be done yesterday. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, prioritize effectively, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed. The difference? Knowing when to guide and when to give space.

### Ineffective Managers: Fixers vs. Phantoms

Ineffective managers usually fall into two categories: **fixers** or **phantoms**.

The **fixer** jumps in at every issue, giving step-by-step instructions and solving problems themselves. This undermines autonomy, leaving engineers dependent and stifling creativity.

The **phantom** assumes autonomy means hands-off management, offering little guidance. While the team may have freedom, they risk misalignment and wasted effort without clear direction.

Both approaches hinder high agency: fixers smother it, while phantoms neglect it.

### The Impactful Manager: Coach, Not Hero

Impactful managers act as **coaches**, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute.

### 1. **Prioritize and Push for Delivery**

At Sourcegraph, starting work is easy—finishing it is what makes the difference. Impactful managers ensure the team prioritizes tasks that deliver the most value to customers and the business. They balance speed with the need to complete high-priority projects, keeping engineers focused on delivering results, not just staying busy.

Techniques for this:
- **Backlog grooming** to prioritize tasks by impact.
- **Timeboxing** sprints to focus on deliverables.
- **Regular check-ins** to ensure progress on top priorities.

Ineffective managers either allow the team to spread too thin or fail to prioritize, leading to activity without output.

### 2. **Clarify Vision, Trust Execution**

Impactful managers set clear goals aligned with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. They connect the team’s work to customer outcomes and trust engineers to figure out the *how*, giving them the autonomy to drive execution.

Techniques for this:
- **OKRs** to provide clarity without micromanaging.
- **Kickoff meetings** to define objectives and set expectations.
- **RACI frameworks** to assign responsibility while preserving autonomy.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving the team without a clear sense of purpose.

### 3. **Balance Speed with Sustainability**

Speed is critical at Sourcegraph, but fast delivery only works if it’s sustainable. Impactful managers know that maintaining long-term velocity requires investing in software quality. Engineers are expected to take ownership of the quality of their code—delivering quickly *and* ensuring the codebase remains robust and scalable.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to **velocity investments**—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. This approach prevents technical debt from slowing the team down in the future. Additionally, impactful managers identify **code hotspots** that slow development, using cleanup projects to address them.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning** that dedicates 25% of time to velocity improvements.
- **Tracking hotspots** in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.
- **Post-release downtime** for refactoring and reducing technical debt.

Ineffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term sustainability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt.

### 4. **Foster Transparency and Accountability**

Transparency is key to keeping teams aligned. Impactful managers create systems that make progress visible and allow feedback to flow freely. Tools like Kanban boards and daily standups ensure blockers are addressed early and everyone stays on track.

Techniques for this:
- **Daily standups** to surface issues and align priorities.
- **Kanban boards** to visualize progress.
- **Retrospectives** to discuss lessons learned and improve processes.

Ineffective managers either control too much or fail to provide oversight, resulting in poor communication and a lack of accountability.

At Sourcegraph, engineering works closely with product, design, TPM, technical success, and marketing. Impactful managers ensure the right stakeholders are brought in at the right time, making collaboration smooth and effective. When these teams aren’t available, impactful managers advocate for their perspectives, ensuring decisions reflect the broader company goals.

Techniques for this:
- **Cross-functional meetings** to align with stakeholders.
- **Stakeholder check-ins** to ensure key perspectives are integrated.
- **Advocacy** for absent stakeholders to keep decisions in line with company priorities.

Ineffective managers overlook these crucial inputs, leading to disconnected teams and misaligned goals.

### 6. **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

Impactful managers build autonomy by asking the right questions rather than providing all the answers. When engineers face challenges, impactful managers guide them to think through solutions, helping them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching** to help engineers think critically.
- **Socratic questioning** to guide engineers to solutions.
- **Decision templates** to help engineers outline their thought process.

Ineffective managers either solve problems themselves or fail to address them, preventing engineers from growing their autonomy.

### 7. **Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Impactful managers recognize that resilience is as important as speed. They celebrate wins, big or small, to keep morale high. They also frame failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.

Techniques for this:
- **Demo days** to showcase achievements and celebrate progress.
- **Failure retrospectives** to learn from mistakes without assigning blame.
- **Public recognition** to reinforce team successes and build momentum.

Ineffective managers either ignore achievements or punish failure, creating a culture of fear rather than innovation.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers balance guidance with autonomy. They prioritize work effectively, maintain transparency, and empower engineers to take ownership of both results and the quality of the codebase. By collaborating across teams, celebrating wins, and learning from failures, they build high-agency, high-performing teams that can move fast and stay sustainable.

Ultimately, the role of an impactful manager isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build a team of heroes.

**Leading with Impact: Building High-Performing Engineering Teams at Sourcegraph**

At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time, and it often feels like everything needed to be done yesterday. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, prioritize effectively, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed. The difference? Knowing when to guide and when to give space.

### Ineffective Managers: Fixers vs. Phantoms

Ineffective managers fall into two categories: **fixers** or **phantoms**.

The **fixer** jumps in at every issue, giving step-by-step instructions and solving problems themselves. This undermines autonomy, leaving engineers dependent and stifling creativity.

The **phantom** assumes autonomy means hands-off management, offering little guidance. While the team may have freedom, they risk misalignment and wasted effort without clear direction.

Both approaches hinder high agency: fixers smother it, while phantoms neglect it.

### The Impactful Manager: Coach, Not Hero

Impactful managers act as **coaches**, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute.

### 1. **Prioritize and Push for Delivery**

At Sourcegraph, starting work is easy—finishing it is what makes the difference. Impactful managers ensure the team prioritizes tasks that deliver the most value to customers and the business. They balance speed with the need to complete high-priority projects, keeping engineers focused on delivering results, not just staying busy.

Techniques for this:
- **Backlog grooming** to prioritize tasks by impact.
- **Timeboxing** sprints to focus on deliverables.
- **Regular check-ins** to ensure progress on top priorities.

Ineffective managers either allow the team to spread too thin or fail to prioritize, leading to activity without output.

### 2. **Clarify Vision, Trust Execution**

Impactful managers set clear goals aligned with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. They connect the team’s work to customer outcomes and trust engineers to figure out the *how*, giving them the autonomy to drive execution.

Techniques for this:
- **OKRs** to provide clarity without micromanaging.
- **Kickoff meetings** to define objectives and set expectations.
- **RACI frameworks** to assign responsibility while preserving autonomy.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving the team without a clear sense of purpose.

### 3. **Balance Speed with Sustainability**

Speed is critical at Sourcegraph, but fast delivery only works if it’s sustainable. Impactful managers know that maintaining long-term velocity requires investing in software quality. Engineers are expected to take ownership of the quality of their code—delivering quickly *and* ensuring the codebase remains robust and scalable.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to **velocity investments**—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. This approach prevents technical debt from slowing the team down in the future. Additionally, impactful managers identify **code hotspots** that slow development, using cleanup projects to address them.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning** that dedicates 25% of time to velocity improvements.
- **Tracking hotspots** in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.
- **Post-release downtime** for refactoring and reducing technical debt.

Ineffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term sustainability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt.

### 4. **Drive Business Needs with Cross-Functional Collaboration**

Impactful managers understand that engineering doesn’t exist in a bubble. They collaborate closely with product, design, TPM, technical success, and marketing to meet the broader needs of the business. Their job is to ensure the right stakeholders are involved at the right time and to balance competing demands in a way that maximizes impact across the company.

One of the biggest challenges an impactful manager faces is balancing **customer-specific work** with initiatives that benefit the broader user base. Customer requests can be high-agency, urgent, and critical for business success, but the long-term health of the product depends on features and improvements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this balance, ensuring customer needs are met while advancing projects that align with Sourcegraph’s strategic goals.

Even when stakeholders from different parts of the company aren’t available, impactful managers advocate for their perspectives, making decisions that reflect the business as a whole. This helps ensure that engineering efforts are always aligned with larger priorities.

Techniques for this:
- **Cross-functional meetings** to ensure alignment with stakeholders.
- **Balancing discussions** to weigh customer-specific work against broader product goals.
- **Acting as an advocate** for stakeholders, ensuring decisions reflect the full company perspective.

Ineffective managers either prioritize short-term customer work to the detriment of the broader product or overlook customer needs, causing friction between teams.

### 5. **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

Impactful managers build autonomy by asking the right questions rather than providing all the answers. When engineers face challenges, impactful managers guide them to think through solutions, helping them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching** to help engineers think critically.
- **Socratic questioning** to guide engineers to solutions.
- **Decision templates** to help engineers outline their thought process.

Ineffective managers either solve problems themselves or fail to address them, preventing engineers from growing their autonomy.

### 6. **Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Impactful managers recognize that resilience is as important as speed. They celebrate wins, big or small, to keep morale high. They also frame failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.

Techniques for this:
- **Demo days** to showcase achievements and celebrate progress.
- **Failure retrospectives** to learn from mistakes without assigning blame.
- **Public recognition** to reinforce team successes and build momentum.

Ineffective managers either ignore achievements or punish failure, creating a culture of fear rather than innovation.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers balance guidance with autonomy. They prioritize work effectively, maintain transparency, and empower engineers to take ownership of both results and the quality of the codebase. By collaborating across teams, balancing customer-specific needs with broader goals, celebrating wins, and learning from failures, they build high-agency, high-performing teams that can move fast and stay sustainable.

Ultimately, the role of an impactful manager isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build a team of heroes.

### User - 2024-10-05 12:33:23

Before getting to the sustainability aspects of the speed and sustainability section, add something about building solutions with the right amount of complexity. We want to build a solution that meets the requirements and is not hacky, but we should not overbuild for tomorrow. Things are changing so quickly in our space that we will be better served by simple, robust, easy to modify code than we will be by code that has more generality than than we actually need.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving the team without a clear sense of purpose.

### 3. **Balance Speed with the Right Amount of Complexity**

Speed is critical at Sourcegraph, but it must be paired with building solutions that have the right level of complexity. Impactful managers ensure engineers build solutions that meet today’s needs without over-engineering for tomorrow. Things move quickly in our space, and we’re better served by **simple, robust, and easy-to-modify** code than by overgeneralized systems. This doesn’t mean cutting corners, but it does mean focusing on solving the problem at hand rather than future-proofing unnecessarily.

The goal is to deliver high-quality solutions that aren’t hacky, but also don’t include more complexity than needed. This keeps the codebase flexible and allows the team to adapt as priorities shift.

### 4. **Balance Speed with Sustainability**

Once the right solution is in place, the next challenge is ensuring that speed remains sustainable. Fast delivery only works if it doesn’t accumulate technical debt that will slow the team down later. Impactful managers know that maintaining long-term velocity requires investing in software quality. Engineers are expected to take ownership of the quality of their code—delivering quickly *and* ensuring the codebase remains robust and scalable.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to **velocity investments**—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring.

Where could this summary be strengthened by building on ideas from the "What it's like working at Sourcegraph" essay below? Is there anyplace this summary is inconsistent with that essay?

What it’s like working at Sourcegraph

Software affects everything and everyone, yet only a small subset of the population can build it today. Our long-term vision at Sourcegraph is to make it so everyone codes, giving everyone the power to influence the world.

Today, that starts with professional devs. It's the developers building and refining code who push the world forward. Our customers are the unsung heroes who make systems faster or cheaper for billions of people, day after day, week after week. We salute these developers, and we've built something they really love.

We've been building dev tools for much longer than dev tools has been a trendy or hyped investment space. That reflects our long-term conviction in fulfilling our vision.

Because of that, we're in a unique position. We're an established company with over a decade of experience and substantial ARR, delivering great dev experiences into codebases small and large—including the largest codebases in the world where the vast majority of developer-hours are spent. At the same time, with Cody, we're at the forefront of the most competitive and exciting AI-powered developer tools space. This duality defines our culture: we combine the stability and expertise of an established company with the agility and innovation of a startup.

Few other companies can claim our track record while maintaining our ability to innovate and pivot with the rapid pace of advancement in the field. Riding the leading edge of innovation while delivering an excellent experience into large enterprises is a unique skillset, and doing both well has required us to develop a unique culture. This culture is not for everyone, but we've found that it enables a special type of person to thrive and do their life's best work. 

Here's what you can expect as part of the Sourcegraph team:

Things move fast and change often: We move quickly and adapt swiftly. In the rapidly evolving world of AI and dev tools, we iterate fast and ship often. You'll need to think on your feet and be comfortable with change. We seek out high-performing individuals who excel in dynamic, fast-paced environments and we value those who can navigate ambiguity, take initiative without constant oversight, and turn uncertainty into opportunity. 
We’re hands-on and results-oriented: Everyone at Sourcegraph cares deeply about what we do and how it affects our users and customers. This means you'll see our co-founders coding, you'll get feedback on projects from people outside your immediate team, and we expect you to be an active contributor and speak up if you see ways we can improve. We do whatever it takes to get things done (including working late nights and weekends when necessary).No job is too big or too small, regardless of your role, because we’re all focused on delivering tangible results that move the needle for our company and our customers.
We’re ambitious: Our goal is to become the indispensable tool for every dev on the planet. We tackle complex challenges head-on and constantly push the boundaries of what's possible. We expect everyone, regardless of role, to bring their A-game and to never settle for "good enough". We're here to build the most impactful company in our space, and that requires our team members to reach the pinnacle of their field. 

Now, let's dive into our core values and how they shape our day-to-day work and decision making:
Dev love
Everything we do is ultimately for devs (anyone who codes). Every dollar we earn comes from devs trying, using, loving, fighting for, and sharing our product. All Sourcegraph teammates code to better understand our users and customers and to do their jobs better (in ways that make sense for their role). Our long-term mission is to make it so everyone code, not just the 0.1% of the population who are devs today.

In action:
We regularly engage with our user community, seeking feedback and insights to drive our product development.
Our team members, from engineers to marketers, actively participate in coding projects to better understand the developer experience.
We dogfood our own product constantly to build empathy with our users and so that we know we're building a product that solves the right problems. 
We host hackathons, contribute to open-source projects, and maintain a bustling community of pro devs so we’re always connected to the things they care about most.
High agency
We believe in the power of individual initiative and responsibility. Everyone here has a high degree of autonomy and freedom, which requires hard work, responsibility, initiative, fast iteration, and optimism in the face of challenges. We think and act like owners of our work and hold each other accountable to do the same so we can do the best work of our lives. This environment of high autonomy and minimal oversight is ideal for those who can turn uncertainty and ambiguity into structured progress and innovation.

In action:
You'll have the freedom to propose and lead projects that align with our mission.
We encourage experimentation and calculated risk-taking. If you have an idea that could improve our product or processes, you're empowered to pursue it.
You'll be expected to make decisions and act on them, rather than waiting for top-down directives. In two-way door situations, we’d much rather you act fast with the best interest of the business in mind, than wait for leadership to approve our ideas or give you explicit guidance on what to do next. 

Win together: 
We are a company of owners, not just individual contributors. We fiercely defend individual accountability while recognizing that our greatest triumphs come from collective effort. This paradox defines us: we're simultaneously independent forces and a unified team. We push the boundaries of personal responsibility, yet we know that isolation breeds mediocrity. Our success hinges on finding the sweet spot between individual drive and seamless collaboration. We speak up boldly, challenge ideas fearlessly, and know when to rally behind decisions unanimously. We succeed together or not at all.

In action:
Cross-functional collaboration is the norm. You'll work closely with team members from different departments on a regular basis.
We celebrate team wins and learn from shared challenges through regular company meetings, retrospectives, and many regular updates in our #progres and #thanks channels.
As both team members and shareholders, we all have a stake in Sourcegraph's success, fostering a culture of mutual support and shared goals.

Direct & transparent
We believe in straight talk and candid information sharing, while emphasizing the importance of clear, explicit communication. Our commitment to transparency is a mutual contract, not just a leadership responsibility. Internally, we operate with transparency, which helps us move fast and make good decisions. This transparency comes with responsibility: we respond positively to directness, avoid "fanning the flames" or drawing unwarranted conclusions, and ask for clarification when needed. We recognize that not hearing feedback, waiting longer for information, or having less input into decisions are far worse alternatives. As part of our culture, we manage our reactions to information objectively, process it responsibly, and avoid escalating situations unnecessarily. We are willing to disagree and commit.

In action:

You'll participate in regular feedback sessions, both giving and receiving candid input to help everyone improve.
Our internal communications are open by default. You'll have access to company-wide information and decision-making processes.
We hold regular AMAs with leadership, encouraging open dialogue about company direction and challenges.
We distinguish between information access and official communication. While our open culture provides access to extensive information, we expect decisions and actions to be communicated clearly and directly.
We strongly discourage "reading between the lines" or “fanning the flames”. If something isn't clearly communicated, we encourage asking for clarification rather than making assumptions or drawing meta conclusions which can make things feel and appear bigger than they are. 
We foster a gossip-free environment. Instead of talking about others, we encourage open, honest, and respectful dialogue directly with people involved in issues.


If you're excited by the challenge of simplifying the complex world of code, if you're driven to make a significant impact, if you thrive in an environment that moves fast, and if you excel at turning uncertainty and ambiguity into opportunity and progress—we'd love to chat.

To align the “Leading High-Performing Engineering Teams at Sourcegraph” summary with the "What It’s Like Working at Sourcegraph" essay, several adjustments can be made to both strengthen the summary and ensure consistency:

### Key Areas for Strengthening the Summary:

1. **High Agency**:
   The essay emphasizes Sourcegraph’s high-agency culture—where individuals have autonomy and are expected to take initiative and responsibility. This theme is core to Sourcegraph’s DNA and should be reinforced in the management framework.
   
   - **Where to Strengthen**: The section on **Prioritize and Push for Delivery** could lean more into trusting engineers to make decisions and act with autonomy, reinforcing that Sourcegraph managers empower teams to take responsibility for outcomes. Additionally, the **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling** section could build more on how managers foster this culture by encouraging initiative and decision-making in the face of ambiguity.

   - **How to Modify**: Include more explicit language about the role of autonomy in prioritization and delivery, as well as how high agency is not only a trait but an expectation. For example:
     - In **Prioritize and Push for Delivery**: Highlight that managers provide engineers the freedom to drive their own projects and make high-agency decisions, balancing team autonomy with business needs.
     - In **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**: Emphasize how impactful managers actively encourage engineers to take ownership of decisions without waiting for explicit direction, staying consistent with the idea that Sourcegraph’s team members are expected to think and act like owners.

2. **Dev Love**:
   The essay repeatedly underscores the importance of **dev love**—everything Sourcegraph does is for developers, and everyone codes to understand the product and the user experience better.

   - **Where to Strengthen**: While the summary talks about cross-functional collaboration, it doesn’t fully reflect the company’s commitment to **dev love**—i.e., how decisions around product development and engineering align with making developers’ lives easier.

   - **How to Modify**: Add more emphasis on how **Dev Love** guides decision-making, especially in the **Balance Speed and Stability** section. For example:
     - Acknowledge how impactful managers, even while balancing speed and stability, prioritize solutions that deliver the most value to devs—our core users. Reinforce the idea that Sourcegraph’s mission to delight developers is the key lens through which all engineering work is viewed.

3. **Win Together**:
   Collaboration across departments is key to the Sourcegraph culture. While the section on cross-functional collaboration in the summary is solid, there’s room to reflect more on the balance between individual ownership and teamwork.

   - **Where to Strengthen**: The section on **Drive Business Needs with Cross-Functional Collaboration** can build on the idea that Sourcegraph’s culture balances personal accountability with a collective mission—"win together."

   - **How to Modify**: Highlight that impactful managers not only bring in stakeholders at the right time but also foster a shared sense of ownership across teams, reflecting that collaboration is necessary for Sourcegraph’s biggest wins.
     - Example phrasing: "Impactful managers understand that while high agency is critical, the biggest wins come from cross-team collaboration—ensuring all departments are aligned in their shared mission to delight developers and deliver value to the broader business."

**Leading High-Performing Engineering Teams at Sourcegraph**

At Sourcegraph, we move fast, think big, and constantly adapt to new challenges. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, act with high agency, and deliver real value to our users—especially developers. Ineffective managers, on the other hand, either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed. The difference? Knowing when to guide and when to give space.

### 1. **Prioritize and Push for Delivery**
Impactful managers help teams balance autonomy with focus, ensuring engineers prioritize tasks that deliver the most value to customers, devs, and the business. They give engineers the freedom to drive their own projects, trusting their high agency while ensuring alignment with Sourcegraph’s goals. The focus is on **finishing** projects, not just starting them.

Techniques:
- **Backlog grooming** to prioritize by business impact.
- **Timeboxing** sprints to stay focused on deliverables.
- **Regular check-ins** to track progress and remove blockers.

### 2. **Clarify Vision, Trust Execution**
Impactful managers set clear goals aligned with Sourcegraph’s mission to delight developers and trust engineers to figure out the *how*. We expect managers to foster autonomy while ensuring the team drives toward results, holding the balance between creativity and accountability.

Techniques:
- **OKRs** for clarity without micromanagement.
- **RACI frameworks** to assign ownership and responsibility.

### 3. **Balance Speed and Stability**
We operate in a fast-paced environment, but speed must be balanced with building solutions that are simple, robust, and easy to modify. Impactful managers guide their teams to build the right level of complexity—solving today’s problems without overbuilding for tomorrow. **Dev love** is at the heart of this: we focus on delivering high-quality code that serves developers today while remaining flexible for future needs.

Once the right solution is in place, impactful managers ensure that speed remains sustainable. We expect engineers to own the quality of their code, investing 25% of project time in **velocity improvements** like testing, documentation, and refactoring. This balance between speed and stability is key to maintaining long-term velocity.

### 4. **Drive Business Needs with Cross-Functional Collaboration**
Engineering at Sourcegraph doesn’t operate in isolation. Impactful managers ensure that all relevant stakeholders—product, design, TPM, technical success, and marketing—are brought in at the right time. The biggest challenge here is balancing **customer-specific work** with initiatives that benefit the broader user base. Impactful managers collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize the right work, ensuring short-term customer needs are met without losing focus on long-term product goals.

Even when stakeholders aren’t available, impactful managers advocate for their perspectives, ensuring decisions are aligned with business needs.

### 5. **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**
Managers at Sourcegraph foster high agency by guiding engineers to make their own decisions. Instead of solving problems for their teams, impactful managers ask the right questions, helping engineers build problem-solving skills and confidence.

### 6. **Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**
Speed and resilience go hand-in-hand. Impactful managers celebrate every win and treat failures as learning opportunities. By doing this, they foster a culture of growth, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

By reflecting the high-agency culture, hands-on involvement, and Sourcegraph's unique duality (stability + agility), these changes should strengthen the summary while ensuring consistency with the "What it’s like working at Sourcegraph" essay.
