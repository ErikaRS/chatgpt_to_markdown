## Review

## Reflections

Ultimately, I found this book rather frustrating. While the key flux "superpowers" were a great list of ways to deal with this volatile, uncertain, complex, adaptive world, the book itself did not feel super applicable. Part of this was because the examples pulled from a fairly standard progressive mindset. While I am generally pretty aligned with that mindset, I am also a dedicated systems thinker, and I felt that making it feel like a progressive outlook is a natural outcomes of systems thinking unnecessarily brings a partisan lens to what are some of life's most valuable ways of thinking and acting. 


Actually, here's a perspective shift: maybe the way to think about this book is looking at progressive values through a more systems thinking lens. When I look at it that way, it's less annoying but also less likely something I would have picked up in the first place.

Or maybe another way to put it is that it seems more self-helpy than systems-y. 

It also has a fair bit of romanticism toward ancient wisdom / cultures.

## Detailed contents & notes
Preface
- When was the last time change hit your life?

Introduction Who Moved My Future?
- "April, are you sitting down?"
- Our new-now-next-never normal
- What is most in flux right now?
    - This is a simple exercise to get your creative flux juices flowing.
    1. Without overthinking it, write a list of all the things that are upside down in your life right now. Think micro and macro, from small shifts in daily routines to future unknowns.
    2. Rank them, if you'd like. Do you notice any common themes?
    3. What emotions come up? Excitement, anxiety, curiosity, confusion... these are all equally valid.
    4. Notice if different kinds of flux yield different responses, or if your responses change at different times.

    - My journey to flux
    - The new script for leadership in flux
    - Your roadmap to flux
    - How to read this book

Chapter 1 Run Slower
- To thrive in a fast-paced world, slow your own pace.
- How fast are you running?
    - This is a two-part exercise. First, answer the following honestly: 
        - Do you feel like you're running too fast? 
        - From whom or where does your "need for speed" come? 
        - If you slowed down enough to shift your attention, what do you think you'd discover?
        - If you knew that you'd die tomorrow, for what purpose or towards whom would you run?
        - Bonus question: Did you have difficulty "pausing" long enough to do this exercise?
    - Second, on a piece of paper, draw four concentric circles (like a target with a bull's-eye) and label them as follows:
        - The inner circle is **your personal quest:** your relationship with yourself, your personal goals, and how you wish to show up in life.
        - The second circle is **your personal relationships:** with friends, family, and loved ones.
        - The third circle is **your role(s) in organizations:** your professional responsibilities, expertise, colleagues, etc.
        - The outer circle is **your role(s) in the world:** for example, as a citizen, a consumer, a climate advocate, a traveler, etc.
    - Jot down where you're running too fast. Which circles do they fall within? Are any circles empty?
    - Next, write why. Where does the desire to run too fast come from? Are you driving yourself to do more, or are others driving you? When did the pressure to run faster begin? (Did you notice it at that time?) You might also jot down your typical coping mechanisms and whether they have helped.
    - Now look at the whole picture. Which areas of your life need to slow down most? Do any of them feel easier to handle than others?
    - Finally, consider who else could benefit from this exercise-colleagues, family members, and so on-and share it with them.
- The old script at warp speed
- You are not a to-do list
    - *Niks*, Anyone? 
    - *Wu Wei*
- Productivity: For what and for whom?
- Instead of productivity, optimize for presence
    - Stillness practice
    - Silence practice
    - Patience practice
    - Not-to-do (or to-don't) list
    - Micro-sabbaticals
    - Nature bathing
    - Technology Shabbat
- Protect the asset
- Running from ourselves
- Think slow(er) and delay judgment
- From FOMO to JOMO (joy of missing out)
- Leadership fast and slow
    - Think about your typical decision-making style. Do you tend to decide fast or to contemplate?
        - If you move quickly, do you consider your potential blind spots?
        - If you move slowly, do you have a filter for when the time is right?
    - Think about your leadership style. Do you expect your colleagues and partners to adopt your pace? Why or why not?
    - Reflect on a situation in which a decision took longer than expected. What did you observe, process, and learn during the delay? How did this affect your actions?
- What roses?
- Run slower: Reflections
    - 1. In which areas of your life do you feel you're running too fast? 
    - 2. From whom or where does your "need for speed" come? Are you driving yourself to run faster, or are others driving you? 
    - 3. When did the pressure to run faster begin? Did you notice it at that time? 
    - 4. What are your typical coping mechanisms? Which ones have been most useful? Which ones need to be replaced or retired? 
    - 5. If you slowed down, what do you think you'd discover?

Chapter 2 See What's Invisible
- The superpower: See what's invisible
    - When life feels blurry or the future is uncertain, shift your focus from what's visible to what's invisible.
- Your social and cultural orientation shapes what and how you see
- You are what you see... and so much more
    - Pause for a moment and think about what and how you really see. Consider, for example:
        - When you meet someone for the first time, what is the first question you ask them?
        - In a job interview, do you spend more time talking about the professional experience that's on the candidate's résumé or the lived experience that's not on it?
        - When you meet someone for the first time, do you feel they can be trusted?
        - Do you believe that if something cannot be measured, then it does not exist?
        - Do you believe that capitalism is empowering or oppressive?
        - Does empty space inspire you, bore you, or scare you?
        - Do you believe that expressing one's vulnerability is courageous or wimpy?
        - Have you faced organizational challenges that were "hard to see" according to traditional strategy models?
        - If you could drive with only one set of headlights, would you choose high beams or fog lights?
        - Do you sense that something is missing in your life, or waiting for you, but can't quite identify what?
    - If any of these questions intrigues you or rings true, this chapter is for you.
- Check your privilege and your options
- What does your worldview make visible... and keep invisible?
    - Take a moment and consider who and what shaped your worldview most: from the values that your parents or caretakers instilled in you, to where you lived and went to school, who your friends are, your profession and ambitions, and your beliefs about the future. Here are a few questions to get started: 
        - What does fear look like, or feel like, to you? 
        - Were you taught to fear change or embrace it? 
        - Were you told to be quick to trust or quick to mistrust? 
        - Were you encouraged to hang out with people who are like you or different from you? 
        - How might privilege have blinded you or kept you from seeing the full picture? 
        - What was erased from your view of the world? What was left out of your script? 
    - *It is easy to see the branches of trees moving, but it takes practice to see the wind.* – Social entrepreneur and executive Elaine Genser Smith
- How do you see others? Consumer vs citizen
- Invisible skills
    - Do you tend to trust your head or your heart more? 
    - When making a new hire, is technical expertise, kindness, or relationship savvy most important? 
    - When your peers tell you to turn right, do you ever want to turn left instead? 
    - Can you detect invisible patterns? 
    - Do you live amid invisible rules?
- The empty space
    - Learning to see
    - Expand your peripheral vision
    - (Re)assess your intention
- Make the invisible, visible
- See what's invisible: Reflections
- SEE WHAT'S INVISIBLE: REFLECTIONS
    1. Do you tend to trust your head or your heart more?
    2. When your peers tell you to turn right, do you ever want to turn left instead?
    3. Can you detect invisible patterns?
    4. How aware are you of the rules that govern your life? How explicit are they?
    5. How has privilege (or lack of privilege) affected your script? What kind(s) of privilege?

Chapter 3 Get Lost
- The Superpower: get lost
    - In the landscape of change, getting lost is how you find your way.
- The lost universe
- Getting lost, finding yourself
    - Recall a story about a time you got lost or disoriented. It could be in a foreign country, a parking lot, or your own home. Don't overthink it. 
    - Think about how you responded to being lost at that time. What feelings came up? Did you feel fearful and frustrated, or curious and adventurous? 
    - Think about how you would like to react to getting lost. Go back to your story. Were you telling it from the perspective of your old script or new script? Can you retell it from a vantage point of hope and discovery?
- Lost ≠ Loss ≠ Failure
- Trade-offs and scarcity
- Growth beyond your comfort zone
- Lost by another name
    - When faced with uncertainty, do you draw on other cultures, traditions, or stories to help you cope? Which ones? How are their scripts different from yours? How did you learn about them? 
    - What was the last book you read by a person from a very different culture than yours?
- Not lost. Just temporarily misplaced.
    - Do you know your *weiji* from your *wabi sabi*
    - The power of *bildung*
- Uncertainty by another name
- Coddiwompling
- Lady, are you lost?
- Get lost: Reflections
    1. When you become disoriented, do you typically feel frustrated, fearful, or curious?
    2. Do you tend to see detours as hassles or adventures?
    3. When you were growing up, were you encouraged to hang out with people who are like you or different from you? What were those people like? What did you learn?
    4. When faced with uncertainty, who or what grounds you and helps you find your way?
    5. To what extent do other cultures or traditions factor into your worldview? How are these scripts different from yours? How did you learn about them?

Chapter 4 Start with Trust
- The superpower: Start with trust
    - When trust seems broken, assume good intent
- Examine your own notions of trust
    - Do you think people are born good, or are people born evil? 
    - Where do you think you got this assumption from? 
    - How has this assumption played out in your life? 
    - Could you consider the opposite? What are the implications of doing so? 
    - How does trust of a spouse differ from that of an organization? 
    - Does technology help you trust more, or less? 
    - When you ask people to "trust you," how does it feel? 
    - *As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live.* — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
- Mistrust destroys genius
- Breaches of trust by (outdated) design
- Inequality breeds mistrust
- Ancient wisdom, timeless trust
- Trust, truth, and ancient cultures
- The new script: design from trust
- The new script: lead with trust
    - It sucks to hide everything
    - The paradox of vulnerability and trust
- But this feels so... weird!
- In flux we trust
- Start with trust: reflections
    1. Can the average person be trusted? Why or why not? What influences your response? 
    2. . Are you usually quick to trust or quick to mistrust? 
    3. Do you trust yourself? When does your trust in yourself falter most? 
    4. If something can’t be measured, does it exist? 5. When you ask people to “trust you,” how does it feel?

Chapter 5 Know Your "Enough"
- The superpower: know your enough
    - In a world relentlessly striving for more, know your "enough."
- Today's tension: too much vs not enough
- What is your enough?
    - How do you define “enough” today? Do you define it differently for yourself versus other people? Why or why not? 
    - How do you define your self-worth? What metrics do you use? 
    - What do you have “more than enough” of today? 
    - What do you have “not enough” of today? 
    - What sentiment usually comes up when you think about enough: frustration, inspiration, anticipation, fear, joy, or something else? 
    - What is your “enough” that will help you create a better world? 
    - Keep these answers close at hand while reading this chapter.
- Leading with enough
- Your "enough" personality
    - To spark some creative juices, without overthinking, answer the following questions for yourself: 
        - Would you rather have a boat, or a friend with a boat? 
        - What would you do if you had “enough” time? 
        - When you gift something to someone else, is that a loss or gain for you? 
        - What do you do with excess? 
        - Think about someone who exemplifies “enough.” What is it about them that makes you think this?
- The economics of more
- The psychology of more
- Metrics and values
    - Metrics measure what we value. How we spend our time is how we spend our love. 
        - Whom do you admire more: someone who spends his time getting himself to the top, or someone who helps others reach their dreams? How do you spend your time? 
        - Which metric do you prefer: how someone spends their time or how they spend their money? 
        - What do you value, and how does that reflect your values?
- From more to enough
    - Subtract before adding
    - Give
    - Yoga and subtraction
    - The risk of mis-FIRE-ing
    - Know your happiness from your contentment
    - Drop the superhero capes
- Know your enough and that you are enough
- Know your "enough": reflections
1. Is more really better? Why or why not? 
2. When you give someone else a gift, is that a loss or gain for you?
3. How do you define “enough” today? Do you define it differently for yourself versus other people? Why or why not? 
4. How do you define your self-worth? What metrics do you use? 
5. Think about someone who exemplifies “enough.” What makes you think this?

Chapter 6 Create Your Portfolio Career
- The superpower: create your portfolio career
    - For success and satisfaction in a world in flux, treat your career as a portfolio to curate rather than a path to pursue.
- What exactly is a portfolio?
- From path to portfolio
- Redefining your professional identity for a world in flux
- Building your portfolio
    - Step 1: What's already in it?
    - Step 2: Be(come) the only
    - Portfolio careers vs. the gig economy
    - Passion: not mandatory, but highly recommended
    - Step 3: cross-pollinate
    - Step 4: redefine your identity
    - Step 5: curate, forever
- The evolution of "What do you do?"
    - “What do you do?” tends to be the first question people ask when meeting someone new. (It’s practically baked into the old script.) We ask children what they would like to do when they grow up. Of course, we’re inquiring about goals, values, passions, and dreams … and these are laudable intentions. But in a world in flux, does this make sense? Or if a robot makes my job obsolete, melting my professional identity with a single swipe, then what do I “do”? 
    - “What do you do?” fundamentally asks the wrong question. “What motivates and inspires you?” is better. Best of all, however, is to ask questions that solicit learning more about a person’s unique script—what makes them who they are, despite whatever changes may whipsaw the world. 
    - Thankfully, there are many different paths of inquiry to pick from today. Here are a few favorites. Which others would you add? 
        - What brings you here today?
        - Who has most inspired you in life? 
        - What are you most grateful for? 
        - What are you most proud of? 
        - Who is the greatest teacher you ever had? 
        - Which six people, living or dead, would you invite to an intimate supper party? 
        - How would you describe your inner compass? 
        - What is your *ikigai,* or reason for being? 
        - What question do you wish more people asked you?
- Portfolio careers and the future of education: welcome to lifelong learning
- Borderless portfolios
- Working together: twenty-first century guilds
- You are so much more than your current job description
- Create your portfolio career: reflections
    1. What would be your professional identity if you lost your job today? 
    2. How would you describe your greatest career aspiration? Could you draw it? 
    3. What’s the first thing you ask when you meet someone new (other than their name)? 
    4. Does the idea of changing roles every few years excite you or scare you? Why? 
    5. If you could be anything, what would it be?

Chapter 7 Be All the More Human (and Serve Other Humans)
- The superpower: be all the more human (and serve other humans)
    - In a world with more robots, your key to thrive is to be all the more human—and to use your humanity to help others.
- Humanity and the brain
- Service and suffering
- *Yin* your *yang*
    - The yin effect and VUCA 
- Boost your DQ
- Do you DQ?
- Hope and consciousness
- Rooted in humanity, oriented toward service
- Be all the more human (and serve other humans): refelctions
    1. Do you tend to think in terms of “me” or “we”? 
    2. Do you maintain an appropriate balance with technology? Why or why not? 
    3. How would you characterize your yin-yang (im)balance today? 
    4. What happens to your emotions and well-being when you disconnect from technology? (Can you recall the last time you went completely offline for more than a day?) 
    5. Do you feel that you’re able to show up “fully human”? Why or why not?

Chapter 8 Let Go of the Future
- The superpower: Let go of the future
    - Letting go of the future enables a better future to emerge.
    - Stuck in the past, fearing the future
    - Afraid to let go
    - Control: perception vs reality
    - The new script: 3 shifts to flux
        1. A mindset shift: from predict to prepare
        2. An expectations shift: from "things will go to plan" to "plans will change"
        3. A shift in focus: from known to unkown 
- Scenario map your life
    - Scenario mapping is a favorite tool of futurists. It’s a type of forecasting that maps out many different possible scenarios, given a particular situation, with the goal of providing smart, grounded ideas of what the future might hold. In practical terms, it’s a powerful mechanism to guide the shift from prediction to preparation. 
    - While scenario mapping is commonly used by companies and organizations, it can be helpful in a wide range of settings: from assessing the future of a given sector (e.g., education), concept (e.g., capitalism), or business shift (e.g., work from home) to understanding how your own reality might change (e.g., the future of your career or your kids’ education) and options to respond. Think of it as part secret weapon and part magic wand for navigating life in a world in flux. 
    - Any future scenario has pros and cons. The best scenarios are those that feel feasible to you. Scenarios are basically thought experiments; if your sixth sense says, “Yes, even if some aspects are a bit wild, this sounds like it could happen,” then stick with it. 
    - Scenario maps are typically drawn with two axes that represent two key themes (i.e., four quadrants to explore together). 
    - Any range of issues can be selected. For example: A decade from now, will a four-year college degree be the customary credential, or will there be new options better geared towards today’s world? Will your company’s growth be driven by humans or automation? Personally, what may change in your life—and what would you like to change about it? Play with a range of factors that speak to you. 
    - Once you’ve identified your themes and drawn your axes, let go and imagine the possibilities. In each of the four quadrants, describe a range of possible outcomes, ripple effects, obstacles, and responses. Let your curiosity drive the design. Highlight those that seem most effective, and notice when your intuition says, “Pay attention to this!” Be serious but not so serious as to thwart your creativity. 
    - How can this exercise help you rethink your response to unknowns—wherever they come from?
- Reawaken your agency
- The "problem" with change
- Worry less about worrying
    1. Notice it
    2. Welcome it
    3. Use it
- Begin again
- Hold the future gently
- Let go of the future: reflections
1. When you make plans, do you generally expect that they will work out or not? 
2. Mentally, where do you spend most of your time: in the past, the present, or the future?
3. Describe something that you recently let go of. How did it feel? How did it go? 
4. How does “not knowing” make you feel? 
5. Have you ever scenario mapped your life? If so, how did it go? If not, would you like to? Why or why not?

My highlights. Just ACK it
Highlights
- Change is inevitable. Growth is optional. —JOHN C. MAXWELL ([Location 51](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=51))
- That nothing is static or fixed, that all is fleeting and impermanent, is the first mark of existence. —PEMA CHÖDRÖN ([Location 54](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=54))
- On the one hand, change is universal and inevitable. Regardless of your age, profession, culture, beliefs, traditions, goals, or anything else, change predates humans and has shaped the entirety of history. Indeed, the primary reason you’re alive is because of it! ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=59))
- On the other hand, change is disorienting. Too often it leaves you feeling unmoored, reeling and adrift. Too much change hijacks your ability to show up to life fully today and influences how you perceive the future. ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=61))
- Humans really struggle with change, especially change we did not choose. We resist it, we fear it, and we mistakenly believe we can control it. The more you try to keep change at bay, the more it shows up and the harder it bangs on the door. Despite our best efforts to prevent it, change happens. And it’s not just change; it’s today’s ever-increasing pace of change too. Taken together, it can feel relentless and sometimes just a bit (or way, way, way) too much. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=63))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The future is not more stability or more certainty. The future is more uncertainty, more unpredictability, and more unknowns. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=68))
- Rather, it is about reorienting one’s attitude towards uncertainty and the unknown, and learning to see every change as an opportunity, not a threat—today, tomorrow, and from here on out. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=73))
- Each of the eight Flux Superpowers helps you see differently, grounds you in your truth, and empowers you to thrive—no matter what changes come your way. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=76))
- Globally, we’ve witnessed the worst pandemic since 1918, some of the worst economic straits since the early 1930s, the greatest food insecurity in decades, and a climate catastrophe unprecedented in modern human history. In the United States, this is compounded by social tensions on a scale not seen since 1968. Any one of these crises is enough to shake things up. All of them happening at the same time … is something else entirely. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=97))
    - Note: When you put it this way it is rather a lot...
- And it’s not just what is changing; it’s how fast the world we’ve known is evolving. The pace of change has never been as fast as it is today, and yet, it is likely to never again be this slow. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=104))
- This book is rooted in the simple fact that around every corner, there is more change. The future is not more stable; the future is more uncertain. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=117))
- Humans are not accustomed to this degree of upside-downness. We can be incredibly adaptable when we’re forced to be, but on the whole, we much prefer stability and familiarity. Even people who embrace chaos tend to do so knowing that they can rely on some things not changing. Yet if flux is our “new-now-next-never normal,” then we need to be ready for—and have the tools to flourish in—this new reality. ([Location 118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=118))
- Flux is both a noun and a verb. As a noun, its most common contemporary definition is “continuous change.”2 As a verb, to flux means “to cause or learn to become fluid.”3 Hence we’re living in a world of flux (noun), and we’d do well not merely to flex our mental muscles but to flux (verb) them too. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=122))
- However, choosing to change is a very different experience than having change imposed externally. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=138))
- Virginia Satir developed a five-stage model of change, which underscored the fact that humans typically go along with change so long as it benefits us.4 We willingly embrace change when we’re given a choice and we like the perceived results. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=139))
- Or, as systems thinker Peter Senge says, “We don’t resist change. We resist being changed.” ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=141))
- by and large, a world in flux is about those changes you don’t get to choose. There is no opting in; they just happen, ready or not. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=142))
- It’s about a shift: from struggling with such change to harnessing and developing an eagerness to use it well. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=147))
- Change has been a universal constant since time immemorial. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=149))
- Although each person’s script is different, everyone’s script is shaped by the same forces unfurling and the universal experience of being human. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=160))
- I get that reality is far more nuanced. But the point is: every single person has a script. And for quite some time this script held. It’s been passed down so often that it’s taken for granted. And then. And then, the way things worked flipped upside down. A world in flux arrived. Boom. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=177))
- Whatever the case, the old scripts broke. Your script, my script, and many other people’s scripts are no longer fit for today’s world—or one could say, they are fit for a world that’s no longer there. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=181))
- They’re still in our consciousness, and we still make decisions according to outdated filters because we haven’t actually swapped them out yet. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=184))
- Individually and collectively, we are in the early stages of writing new scripts that are fit for a world in flux. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=185))
- While the old script was written by others for you to follow, your new script is written by you, for you to become. Your new script contains what grounds you and orients you and makes you, you—even when everything else changes. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=186))

- Remember: just as everyone’s old script is unique, so will your new script reflect what is uniquely you. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=192))
- The sympathetic nervous system controls what many people know as the “fight, flight, or freeze” response and prepares the body for intense action, while the parasympathetic nervous system seeks to calm the body, sometimes known as the “rest and digest” function. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=198))
- Normally, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems work together as allies; ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=200))
- Our ever-accelerating world has thrown these systems out of balance. Specifically, we perceive ever more and more dangerous stimuli, which present ever more opportunities for the sympathetic nervous system to hijack our ability to respond appropriately. We are not being chased by tigers, but our bodies respond as if we were. Too many perceived tigers, and we lose the ability to calm down. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=203))
- Today, it’s not just our individual nervous systems that get hijacked. Anxiety is now manifest at every level: individual, organizational, and societal. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=206))
- Moreover, digital technologies are correlated with increases in anxiety: the mere presence of your own smartphone reduces your available cognitive capacity. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=209))
- Of course, to some degree it is natural to feel anxious when the world is on edge. But if we’re looking at a future of constant change, then we must treat this as a society-wide anxiety crisis: an unspoken epidemic, which many people don’t want to believe so we don’t talk about it, yet the statistics and lived experiences tell another story. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=223))
- A Flux Mindset sees change as an opportunity, not a threat, by being clear and grounded in your values. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=229))
- We’re still clinging to an old, outdated script, when what’s actually needed is to write a new script. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=234))
- You can think of a Flux Mindset as the state of mind, body, and spirit that grounds you and holds you when everything else changes. In practice, a Flux Mindset has several essential elements, including core values, comfort with paradox, and the ability to see uncertainty from a place of hope rather than fear. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=235))
- My Flux Mindset is rooted in an unwavering faith in humanity, which is related to a commitment to service and a deep, clear appreciation for diversity. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=241))
- Both remind me that there is no one way to “do” change. And both underscore that an effective relationship with change always begins from within. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=247))
- A growth mindset reflects “the understanding that abilities and intelligence can be developed.” It is characterized by a belief that (1) you can get smarter, and (2) effort makes you stronger. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=253))
- With a Flux Mindset, you are so grounded in your values and your new script that when change jostles (or even clobbers) your world, you can’t help but see it as an opportunity. Change is no longer threatening; it is both expected and often welcomed. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=257))
- Being grounded means having both stability and clarity. Stability gives you courage and helps you trust; clarity enhances your vision, guides your direction, and helps you focus. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=278))
- Your orientation includes what is around you, above you, and beyond you. It includes knowing where help is and where potential dangers lie. It is the basis of how you navigate: a day, a situation, a new place, a delicate conversation, or change in the world at large. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=280))
- For centuries, the North Star and Southern Cross have helped explorers orient and guided their journeys. What is your North Star or Southern Cross in times of flux? ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=310))
- Seafaring cultures learn how to read horizons, decipher clouds, and track waves. There is no “ground” to speak of, yet these sailors are intimately oriented with their surroundings. How do you surf the waves of change? ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=312))
- In yoga philosophy, drishti is a focused gaze whose purpose is to develop concentration and keep your balance. The object of your drishti can be a dot on the wall, an object on the floor, or a pinpoint on the horizon. What is your drishti in a world in flux? ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=314))
- The North Star is above you. The horizon is beyond you. Your drishti is in front of you. None of these things is defined by physical land, yet they all orient you to your landscape and ground you within it. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=317))
- Think of a Flux Mindset as your newly minted compass for change: it grounds you, orients you, and guides you when everything around you is moving. It’s your North Star, drishti, surf-board, and terra firma all at once. It is grounded in your core values, reflects your true self, and enables you to be yourself whatever changes may come. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=320))
- The eight Flux Superpowers are: 1. Run Slower 2. See What’s Invisible 3. Get Lost 4. Start with Trust 5. Know Your “Enough” 6. Create Your Portfolio Career 7. Be All the More Human (and Serve Other Humans) 8. Let Go of the Future ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=328))
- Regardless, none of the Flux Superpowers requires anything you don’t already have within you: no fancy technology, no genius IQ, not even an app. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=355))
- Perhaps you’ve already noticed that there’s an unconventional twist to this: the Flux Superpowers are superpowers only if you have opened a Flux Mindset and believe that a new script is your best path forward. If you are stuck in the old script, then you will see the Flux Superpowers as liabilities, or unhinged somehow. You will say that to run slower is to be lazy, or to let go of the future is to give up. But this is not what the new script says at all. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=361))
- But Flux Superpowers are just as much disciplines as their erstwhile counterparts, the Old Habits (that die hard). There is just as much (and some would say, far more) discipline involved in running slower than running ever faster on the hamster wheel. There is just as much (and again, some would say even more) discipline in letting go as in hanging on to assumptions that are past their prime. Peace is not passivity. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=370))
- Just as each person’s old script is unique, based on each individual’s life experience, so will your new script reflect what is uniquely you. That’s one of the most exciting things about your new script: only you can write it! No one can write it for you, and no one can write the same script as you. It’s a custom fit! ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=377))
- When you learn to run slower, you begin to crave a calmer pace. Silence becomes a friend. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=381))
- When you learn to see what’s invisible, you discover marvelous new universes of opportunity—and that the old script made you blind to things you genuinely care about. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=382))
- When you learn to get lost, you begin to feel delight when things don’t go according to plan, when plans change, or when you have no clue what will happen next. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=384))
- When you learn to start with trust, you yearn for more trust. You’re better equipped to earn trust and allow others’ trustworthiness to shine through. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=385))
- When you know your “enough,” you begin living in abundance and take better care of yourself and others. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=387))
- When you learn to create a portfolio career, you immediately stop seeing work merely as “having (or getting) a job.” You no longer fret about losing a job and can position yourself confidently towards the future of work. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=388))
- When you learn to be fully, wholeheartedly human, your relationships with other people (and your mental health, and your sleep) improve. You’re finally able to recalibrate your relationship with technology too. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=390))
- When you learn to let go of the future, you find it looks brighter than ever. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=392))
- Each of these experiences has taught me that every “kind” of change, welcome or not, opens one’s Flux Mindset further. The more change is thrown your way, the stronger your Flux Mindset can become—if you lean into it. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=422))
- But in a world in flux, and with a new script in hand, what makes a good leader discernibly changes—in terms of both hallmark characteristics and who qualifies as a leader. ... It all depends on your relationship to change: your ability to lead yourself and others in, through, and beyond flux. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=428))
- For example, a 2019 study by Leaders on Purpose found that the top leadership skill needed today is comfort with risk and ambiguity. The best leaders can live with, navigate, and trust ambiguity in ways that others can’t.9 In other words, great leadership in flux seeks the opposite of certainty. Rather, the goal is clarity of vision, which also means knowing when to take leaps of faith that defy old-script metrics. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=431))
- Leadership in a world in flux can come from any direction: it is not confined to the top. It harnesses the principles of “new power” of networks, ecosystems, and collective wisdom. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=436))
- When society said turn right, I learned to listen to my inner voice—which often nudged me to turn left. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=454))
- Today, I can paint dozens of different pictures of my future (or any future!). And yet, as only one future ultimately unfolds, I’ve become adept at letting go of the rest (which is to say, most possible futures and most of the time). ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=455))
- Time and again, I saw that we create fear, or make fear go away, depending on the stories we tell ourselves. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=466))
- my guiding, and grounding, question remains the same: If I were to die tomorrow, what would the world need me to do today? ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=469))
- Values come from many places. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=477))
- Your relationship to change begins within. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=479))
- Take care of the internal part first—that is, your relationship to change—and the external dynamics make sense and have clarity they lacked before. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=483))
- No one except you can write your new script, nor can you write anyone else’s script for them. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=484))
- Learning to flux is exhilaratingly hard work. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=486))
- Yet if we dig into the research, we learn that the opposite is true: since 1980, companies that delay layoffs as long as possible perform better over time than companies that fire fast.11 Why? It turns out that not only is top talent hard to replace, but layoffs are devastating to the morale and productivity of the team that remains. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=512))
- It’s that responding quickly doesn’t necessarily mean responding wisely. In a world in flux, fastest doesn’t always finish first. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=518))
- The old script says we must run faster to keep up. But a world in flux has different race conditions because the finish line keeps shifting. Whether it’s business demands, home and family priorities, responsibilities to juggle, relationships to nurture, or relentless uncertainty to decipher: the faster we run, and the more we run without resting or reflecting or even paying attention, the worse our results will be over time. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=522))
- When we learn to run slower, the outcomes are better across the board: wiser decisions, less stress, greater resilience, improved health, a stronger connection with our emotions and intuition, presence, focus, and clarity of purpose. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=526))
- Paradoxically, slowing down actually gives us more time, which leads to less anxiety. Slowing down enhances our productivity in ways that matter and sends burnout to the dustbin. In reality, there are many kinds of growth that can come only with rest. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=527))
- Through trial, error, and deliberate practice, I’ve learned to cherish the power of the pause. I’m more present and less anxious. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=534))
- In reality, running slower means plenty of motion and inquiry—at a sustainable pace. It means caring enough to quiet the mind and focus on what really matters. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=538))
- We are running chronically ever faster and, in so doing, running right past life itself. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=544))
- Now look at the whole picture. Which areas of your life need to slow down most? ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=560))
- And yet each of these apps, each button on your smartphone, is another distraction: another opportunity to veer your thoughts elsewhere, away from the magic of life unfolding right in front of you. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=567))
- But here’s the rub: we’re miserable from all this running. Millennials are dubbed the Burnout Generation, having internalized the idea—which is reinforced by society, our education system, and often our peers and parents—that our self-worth is directly derived from how much we work. Thus, we should be working all the time. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=572))
- The seed of this problem is planted when we’re young and told that we can, and should, “do it all.” (This is often a nuance of the old script.) On the one hand, this message encourages ambition and achievement: great! At the same time, it leaves you feeling forever as though you’re falling short: you don’t do enough, earn enough, or have enough. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=580))
- This leads to a kind of internal persecution: not that you’re not capable, but that if you just work harder, you can be better at everything! Paradoxically, this message results in what psychoanalyst Josh Cohen calls “a strange composite of exhaustion and anxiety, a permanent state of dissatisfaction with who we are and what we have. And it leaves us feeling that we are servants rather than masters of … the unending work we put into achieving our so-called best selves.” ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=583))
- The crux is: all this running is unsustainable and making us crazy, yet somehow we can’t seem to stop. But nobody else is going to stop the merry-go-round. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=590))
- There’s an inextricable link between your ability to slow down and your ability to thrive. Yet this is an increasingly fraught balance to strike because we inhabit a world—a system—that is designed, intentionally or not, to thwart our doing so. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=591))
- Have you ever considered not-doing? ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=595))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- When I say not-doing, I mean really doing nothing. No specific action, no distractions, no goals. And importantly, trusting that the sky will not come crashing down. In fact, it might even be lighter and brighter when you actually stop to appreciate it. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=597))
- In the Netherlands, niksen is the socially acceptable and culturally celebrated concept of not-doing.16 The term literally means “to do nothing,” or to do something specifically without any productive purpose. It’s about “daring to be idle.” ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=599))
- The benefits of niksen are profound. Dutch researchers have found that people who regularly “niks” have lower anxiety, improved immune systems, and even an enhanced ability to come up with new ideas and solve problems.18 The key is to niks regularly (even two minutes a day is a start), without intention and without considering whether it’s productive.

- Chinese Buddhism has embraced the concept of wu wei (無爲), meaning “lack of exertion” or “action through least action,” since 700 BCE.19 Wu wei is central to the philosophy of Taoism. Wu wei is different from niksen in that its goals are clearly strategic: it’s a sort of selective passivity that focuses on adjusting ourselves to a given situation rather than frantically seeking to control it. Wu wei can be achieved only when you’ve slowed down enough to truly gauge the situation at hand. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=608))
- In the face of collective anxiety and doubt worldwide, the best thing we can do is incorporate not-doing into our lives. This can mean pausing, daydreaming, or sitting still. It’s the simple yet profound act of holding yourself in the great space that is the unknown, in order to discover what you’ve been running too fast to become. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=623))
- That’s how consumerism thrives: by making sure we never see ourselves as enough. Yet whether you accept this messaging, indeed if you even see it, is a function of your mindset. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=631))

- The faster we produce and consume goods, the more we damage the environment. The more we look for happiness and satisfaction outside ourselves—a new car, a new dress, almost anything that allows us to “buy and display our way out of sadness,” as psychology professor Tim Kasser says—the more likely we are to be depressed.20 We’re taught to consume, consume, consume—and please don’t think about the side effects, thank you very much.

- INSTEAD OF PRODUCTIVITY, OPTIMIZE FOR PRESENCE ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=665))
- What are we really doing? How in the world have we persuaded one another—and ourselves—that more meetings will somehow make our legacy more important? How have we convinced ourselves that saving five minutes will somehow save our soul? ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=674))
- With the new script, rather than measure meetings, you can gauge presence: your ability to be fully in a moment, experience, or decision. One meeting in which everyone is fully present is worth more than a thousand meetings in which people are distracted. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=675))
- Ultimately, presence is about attention and response. These things are different yet closely related: you respond to what you’re paying attention to. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=677))
- When you’re running fast, you’re unable to pay full attention. When you’re scattered, you pay attention to the wrong things, which often botches your response. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=678))
- And yet, the crux of the solution is simple: slowing down improves your chances of getting the issue and your response right. But that’s not all: you also discover that time is what you perceive it to be. When you slow down, you actually have more time. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=682))
- This is not meditation; it is even simpler. It’s sitting, stilling your mind, and seeing where it wanders. Don’t judge; just notice. Is your mind able to unwind, or does it speed up? ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=688))
    - Note: Well that is mediation. But it is good regardless
- Silence practice: Silence—whether the silence of nature or the silence at the end of a breath cycle (kumbhaka)—helps quiet the mind. Silence can be found almost anywhere: you may have to search a bit, but it is there. Find five minutes to bathe in silence daily. Pay attention to the emptiness. Notice what hangs in the space between you and sound. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=689))
- Cultivating patience is one of the most difficult yet most powerful ways to run slower. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=693))
- deliberately don’t fill that waiting time with social media apps, calls, word games, or whatever else. Just be … and wait. Do you feel tested, or freed? ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=694))
- To-do lists help us run faster and stay on the hamster wheel. A not-to-do list does the opposite. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=696))
- Brainstorm a list of opportunities to pause, whether for a moment or for a month. The simple act of drawing up this list can help relieve tension. It creates a sense of space rather than rushing and serves as a reminder of the many shapes of slowing down. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=698))
- Nature is a microcosm of constant change and an unparalleled tutor for running slower. Find the nearest spot of wilderness—a forest, lake, or open field—and absorb the environment through all five senses. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=701))
- Once a week, disconnect from the use of all technology with screens: smartphones, computers, tablets, and television.23 If that feels like too much, start with a few hours and build up to a day. Use the time for quiet personal reflection, perhaps with an old-school pen and paper. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=705))
- Running slower shifts your focus of attention from outside to inside, with a goal to really listen to what’s going on internally. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=708))
- The punchline was: no matter what your mindset, your body still keeps the score.24 We can’t keep treating conditions like exhaustion, anxiety, and burnout by merely exercising and eating better. We must address the underlying sources of these conditions and meaningfully, consistently slow down. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=712))
- “Protecting the asset” acknowledges that when your mind is wound up, your body is wound up too, and neither functions well. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=716))
- And there is no way for anyone to heal at speed. Quite the contrary: running ever faster ultimately kills. So we must slow down. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=717))
- How am I feeling? Which parts of my body are racing? Which are speaking up, and what are they saying? ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=719))
- Do you try to “work through” distress by ignoring it, or do you give it the time it deserves? ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=724))
- The goal of yoga is to still the fluctuations of the mind, which practitioners throughout history realized involved bringing the body into alignment. The body is but a vessel through which we calm our minds and connect with others. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=732))
- More recently, Sensory Awareness Training (SAT) has become popular. SAT helps enhance your awareness of your senses. It includes a range of exercises, from “five senses check-ins” (spending one minute wholly focused on each of your five senses), developing “mental snapshots” (look around, close your eyes, and see how much you remember), and going barefoot.25 ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=733))
- Eat slower, thoroughly noticing and relishing each bite. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=738))
- Walk slower, paying attention to the details on your path: the patina of a building, the texture of flowers, the eyes of the people you encounter. Even better, walk with a young child and let them set the pace. Follow their explorations. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=739))
- Dance rather than walk to a destination. Rather than putting one foot in front of the other, let your entire body guide you. (Stares from others are worth it: you may even spark a dance party!) ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=742))
- The missing link of this conversation is that “getting more done” is not the same as progress, value, or worth. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=749))
- On the outside, I was doing it all (or at least an awful lot). Yet inside, I was still wracked with anxiety. The more I achieved externally, the more anxious I felt internally. My roots were thin, and I knew that at some point they could splinter, and no amount of external (financial, professional, reputational, etc.) security or reassurances from others could break that fall. ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=759))
- Yet equally revealing is what it led me to observe in many others, in a wide variety of settings and cultures: there is an almost perfect correlation between anxiety and accomplishment. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=764))

More highlights: Just ACK it

Running slower doesn’t only improve your emotional and physical well-being. It also helps you make better decisions and get better results. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=772))
- Over time, your ability to gauge timing has a profound impact on how your life unfolds, period. ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=775))
- In other words, the longer you can wait, the better.27 This is not procrastination; this is about your ability to observe, assess, feel, process, take action … and pause, in order to get the best outcome possible. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=776))
- All too often, we frantically get through the day without reserving time to think, learn, and unlearn—yet this is exactly what we need to do in order to think more clearly. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=781))
- But as Kahneman shows us, being fast on your feet may make you sound smart, but it doesn’t make you wise.29 Opting for what’s familiar means you miss what’s new, and it does a very poor job preparing you for flux! ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=783))
- They were blinded by the promise of quick returns rather than inspired by the fact that creating value takes time. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=800))
- This stands in sharp contrast to the concept of Slow Money: “patient capital” that prioritizes investment in long-term, sustainable systems over making a quick buck and fleeing. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=801))
- Running slower helps you think slower and delay judgment, both of which empower you to manage your time—rather than time managing you—and bring your best self to life. ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=803))
- On average, bad things happen fast and good things happen slow. —STEWART BRAND ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=805))
- If you move quickly, do you consider your potential blind spots? If you move slowly, do you have a filter for when the time is right? ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=813))
- JOMO. Fear of missing out becomes joy of missing out.35 We can flip our FOMO and make it positive. Rather than running faster and fretting about everything we’re not doing, we can run slower and rejoice about it instead. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=825))
- McGinnis suggests a three-step process to start unpacking your FOMO.36 1. Notice the next time you are feeling FOMO. 2. Ask yourself, “Is this jealousy, or could it be revealing something deeper that I am called to do?” 3. Block time on your calendar in the next week to explore this sentiment in more depth. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=828))
- When we suffer from FOMO, life becomes a Tetris game to fit as much as possible into a given day. Creating and holding space to notice is the antithesis. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=835))
- Notice how you feel in the empty spaces in between • Notice your breath • Notice the space between notes of music • Notice the space between the leaves on the trees • Notice the space that opens up when you notice, period ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=837))
- Of course, life isn’t always about being slow. There are times to fly like the wind, to rush into one’s passion, or to burn the midnight oil for one’s dreams. These are moments to cherish, even as they exhaust your reserves. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=846))
- The far bigger challenge and concern, however, is that we do not—and cannot—have meaningful conversations, develop truly innovative solutions, or fully express or receive love when we are rushing around. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=848))
- The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes. —MARCEL PROUST ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=866))
- Sawubona literally means “I see you.” I see all of you: your dignity and your humanity. I see your vulnerability and your pride, your dreams and your fears. I see your agency, your power and potential. I see you and I value you. I accept you for what you are. You are important to me, and you are part of me.38 ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=874))
- Sawubona makes another visible in a way that “hello” does not. It’s an invitation to witness and truly, fully be in the presence of one another. The customary response to sawubona is shikoba, which means “I exist for you.” ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=878))
- When life feels blurry or the future is uncertain, shift your focus from what’s visible to what’s invisible. ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=882))
- What you see is baked into your script; what I see is baked into my script. And in so doing, each of us is also trained—again, whether by choice or by default—to not see other things. We grow certain roots and dismiss others. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=891))
- Norms help ensure that individuals grow up with values, skills, relationships, and the capacity to contribute to society. Norms help keep order and stability. Yet by and large, any set of social norms represents only one way of seeing and being in the world: one slice of an infinitely broader human spectrum. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=895))
- Learning to see what’s invisible doesn’t mean losing focus or ignoring what’s visible. Quite the opposite, in fact: it’s the ability to adjust your gaze, see the full picture, and really understand what’s what. When you learn to see what’s invisible, it becomes easier to embrace change today and a future chock-full of unknowns. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=910))
- When you meet someone for the first time, what is the first question you ask them? ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=926))
- In a job interview, do you spend more time talking about the professional experience that’s on the candidate’s résumé or the lived experience that’s not on it? ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=927))
- No one script is better than another. The Himba, Iroquois, and Japanese traditions are simply different scripts, written by different cultures. However, they all acknowledge what’s invisible and, in so doing, shine light on new ways of understanding. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=940))
- For example, people who live in collectivist societies tend to prioritize the context of a social situation and the big picture when solving problems. They home in on the overarching relationships and interplay of systems beyond any individual’s control. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=948))
- When change hits, we default to our social and cultural scripts. What you, I, or any person sees—and doesn’t see—is a result of this script. But if you can’t see what grounds you, it is much harder to move forward. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=962))
- In learning to see what’s invisible, privilege is a thorny stumbling block. Privilege blinds: It limits people’s perceptions of what’s in their script. It keeps them from seeing the full picture and what’s in the wings. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=968))
- Overcoming the blindness induced by privilege requires learning about the inequities that privilege brings with it. But simply learning about privilege isn’t enough. It takes deliberate action to make the invisible, visible: calling out privilege, even if it’s uncomfortable. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=973))
- Optionality is the ability to keep as many options open as possible. You increase your optionality by keeping an open mind, having a Plan B (and C, D, and E), and expanding your peripheral vision to include more possibilities. ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=977))
- Greater privilege is typically associated with more options. Yet there’s a hook: if you haven’t learned how to see what’s invisible, then privilege will actually blind you. The more you perceive to have on the line, the greater your perceived risk of loss. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=981))
- It is easy to see the branches of trees moving, but it takes practice to see the wind.—Social entrepreneur and executive Elaine Genser Smith ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=991))
- The punchline is: to thrive in constant change, aim to make choices that keep your options open, including the options to change how you think and what you prioritize. Some of your options are likely invisible to you today, and others may be clouded by privilege. Yet when you can check privilege at the door, you can see a richer, more meaningful future ahead of you. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=996))
- Today’s hyper-consumer culture dates back only one-hundred-ish years, to the advent of mass marketing. Mass marketing was itself a result of the newfound plethora of products developed in the Industrial Revolution—which transformed society in countless positive ways yet, at the same time, ever so subtly shifted our sense of worth.44 Previously we were seen as human beings, whose job was to contribute to society and help others. With the advent of consumer mass marketing, we became seen as consumers, whose principal job is to consume. A new, consumer-driven script was born. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1006))
- We’re told to keep following this old, crusty, dangerous script in order to keep the economy intact. Consume, consume, consume! Some people have even begun to believe that their purchasing decisions have a greater impact on society than their voting decisions.45 Let that sink in. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1021))
- GDP does not “see” a wide range of extremely valuable activities that underpin our economy and well-being, such as the “invisible labor” of parenting and volunteering, and the “invisible value” of shared (rather than owned) resources. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1028))
- When we follow the consumer script, we also train our eyes to not see: to not see the full effects of what we buy, to not see those who are struggling. We even stop seeing when there are better paths forward. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1031))
- One way out of this mess is to start seeing one another—and treating one another—as citizens and humans, rather than as consumers. (I mean citizens not in terms of passports and borders but as participants and change agents in society.) This is a new script with a subtle yet profound shift: no longer merely passive purchasers and clickbait targets, we become proactive contributors. Together, we lead responsibly rather than follow blindly. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1038))
- Beyond “buying stuff,” what would you like your legacy to be? ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1042))
- Mandates and calls for greater diversity in the business world and beyond are not new, yet the needle has barely budged. By and large the voices of women, Blacks, Latinxs, and other minorities are still difficult if not at times impossible to be found … or rather, to be seen. It’s not that they’re not out there. It’s that for too long, they’ve been ignored, relegated to the sidelines, and written out of the script. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1055))
- Women and people of color have been showing up for ages and doing the hard work. Unmistakably visible, yet unseen. Full-throated voices, muted. Some of the best and brightest idea generators, concealed in the light of day. Marginalized on the periphery. Occupying the empty spaces. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1060))
- As a futurist, this dynamic makes sense to me because in one way or another, the forces that shape the future are always on the periphery before going mainstream. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1066))
- Indeed, sometimes what’s on the periphery can go mainstream at warp speed. ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1070))
- My point here is simple: we need to drastically improve our ability to see, and appreciate, what’s on the periphery and in the empty space. Not only because a just, equitable society demands it; this is also where truly innovative ideas come from. ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1070))
- Empty space is the ideal place, indeed perhaps the only place, where there is enough oxygen to breathe life into new possibilities. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1072))
- In many ways today’s world is one giant case study of learning where to look and, fundamentally, how to see. When change hits, those who can see what’s on the edges, in the empty space, and where new solutions are to be found are better positioned to navigate uncertainty and be responsible leaders. ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1080))
- We often don’t notice what’s on the periphery or horizon. Perhaps you don’t feel like you have the time, or you’re not sure where to look. Yet there’s an entire universe of new insights and aha’s within your grasp … if you can see it. ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1086))
- • If you want people to buy your products or click on your ads: that’s seeing them as consumers. • If you want to help, create, be of service, and help others reach their potential: that’s seeing them as citizens and collaborators. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1117))
    - Note: why not both?
- • If you ask with an intention to judge or criticize, your mental door is already closed. • If you ask with an intention of curiosity, however, you’re likely to learn something new (including how to ask better questions and question your assumptions). ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1125))
- All too often, we don’t realize how much we don’t see, whether it’s not seeing our own gifts and abilities, or not seeing systemic injustices, or not seeing beauty that’s all around us. The more you’re stuck in the old script, the less you can see. Ultimately, you become blind to the truth and the fullness of life. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1134))
- Lost really has two disparate meanings. Losing things is about the familiar falling away, getting lost is about the unfamiliar appearing. —REBECCA SOLNIT ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1149))
- Bukovina is not on most travelers’ itineraries. Tucked in the northeastern corner of Romania, near Moldova and Ukraine, Bukovina is a sleepy pocket of rolling landscape dotted with Orthodox churches and monasteries. Built between 1487 and 1583, these religious structures are covered inside and out, floor to ceiling, with brilliant frescoes. For centuries candle smoke dimmed the frescoes’ colors and ultimately snuffed out their visibility to the outside world. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1151))
- In the landscape of change, getting lost is how you find your way. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1187))
- But in an upside-down world in which new changes hit every day—when familiarity is itself in flux—getting lost is part of a new script. In this world we are uprooted, disoriented, and unmoored constantly. Whatever compass you’re using has gone kaput. What’s more, this new landscape of change isn’t something you, or I, or anyone gets to choose. Flux just is. ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1190))
- Once you’ve opened a Flux Mindset, getting lost becomes a virtue: a secret weapon and stroke of genius not only to embrace being lost but to actively seek out the unfamiliar and stretch beyond your comfort zone as well. ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1192))
- Fundamentally, this superpower boils down to your response: Does getting lost make you feel comfortable or distressed? Curious or anxious? Can you get out of your own way, or do you trip over your own feet? ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1195))
- If you never get lost, you never actually find your way, and your new script can never fully shine. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1200))
- In the business world (with old-script rules), getting lost is shunned and stigmatized: it’s seen as compromising efficiency and productivity. When we optimize for efficiency, getting lost is the ultimate inefficiency. But not only that: in the process, we sap creativity out of the picture and send the misguided signal that the path ahead is clear. In reality, it is anything but clear. Indeed, if the goal is truly innovative solutions, or fresh thinking, or simply being resilient, then getting lost is essential. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1223))
- But loss and lost are different, and neither means failure ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1231))
- In fact, getting lost might turn out to be not only the antithesis of failure but the best outcome ever. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1235))
- Many people also struggle with getting lost thanks to trade-offs and scarcity thinking, hallmarks of the old script. Trade-off thinking says that the only way I can win is if someone else loses (and vice versa: if you win, I must lose), while scarcity thinking is rooted in the belief that no matter how much there is, there will never be enough. In both cases, the loss-lost-failure cycle repeats. ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1236))
- Today, every single person—young and old, rich and poor, around the world, and across the political spectrum—has lost some part of life as they’ve known it. Globally, the ground has shifted beneath everyone’s feet—and it is far from settled. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1242))
- First: “The world is bigger than your own backyard. Go explore it! You might even find it has some of the answers to the questions you ask at home.” ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1253))
- Second: “The world doesn’t exist to serve you. You’re incredibly lucky to go to school, and that good fortune gives you a responsibility to give back.” ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1255))
- And to wrap up: “Remember, the more different someone looks than you, the more interesting they are to get to know. Why would you want to hang out with people who look like you, sound like you, and eat the same things as you?! That sounds pretty boring to me. Now, go have a good day at school.” ([Location 1256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1256))
- Does getting lost by stretching beyond one’s comfort zone make a meaningful difference in the real world? The answer is a resounding yes. ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1260))
- Diversity invites consideration of different options, opinions, ideas, and points of view. Diversity stretches our imaginations, creativity, and curiosity. It underscores our interdependence and makes us stronger. Diverse teams, boards, and organizations have higher rates of innovation, resilience, and returns over time.55 But that’s not all. Beyond day-to-day benefits, periods of great change demand fresh perspectives. In other words, more diverse teams and individuals exposed to more diversity are more ready for a world in flux. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1262))
- Time and again, across cultures and continents, we are reminded: we are less lost than temporarily misplaced. The point of life is not to not get lost per se but to grow through finding your bearings. When the ground beneath you shifts, you can steady and reorient yourself. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1274))
- In China, crisis is viewed differently. The Chinese word for crisis is wēijī (危机). Wēijī is composed of two symbols: wēi, which represents “danger,” and jī, which represents a turning or “change point.” Crisis is a challenge, but one that demands awareness, sparks curiosity, and opens possibility. ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1283))
- What if more people in more places knew about wēijī? It wouldn’t eliminate crisis, of course, but it could reshape how we wrestle with change. It could insert a dose of hope to temper the fear. ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1286))
- In Buddhism, the bardo is an intermediate, liminal state between death and rebirth. It’s the in-between phase between one state of existence, one way of being, and another. In the bardo, death doesn’t mean only one’s physical death. It can also mean the end of a lifestyle, an illness, or a state of mind. ([Location 1291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1291))
- The original meaning of apocalypse (from Greek apokálypsis) isn’t “disaster” but “revelation and unveiling.” An apocalyptic time is one of great truth and transformation. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1294))
- Wabi sabi is the love of imperfection and the transitory nature of all things. Wabi sabi represents the path to wisdom and success in Japan—in other words, making peace with our ever-aging selves and our ever-changing world.57 Wabi sabi doesn’t attempt to keep things as they are, nor is it thrown off-kilter when they don’t go as planned. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1302))
- Kintsugi (“golden joinery”) is the Japanese philosophy of seeing beauty in what’s broken. It is best known as the art of repairing broken pottery, in which the seam that binds the broken pieces is more beautiful than the original work. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1305))
- Both kintsugi and wabi sabi see—and appreciate and encourage—change as healthy, positive, even aspirational. Yes, change is messy. But wouldn’t it be a better world if we cheered one another along through the hard stuff rather than trying to disguise it? Change can’t be pretended away. ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1307))
- So they created bildung: an educational ecosystem to help people explore these themes and their own personal growth. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1321))
- Bildung reimagines not only educational curricula but also how students of all ages see the world and think about getting (or feeling) lost. It helps people write and interpret their own new scripts. It recognizes the importance of deep listening and resilience. It sees education first and foremost as the ability to navigate complexity and change. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1325))
- Coddiwomple is an essential entry in the Flux Mindset lexicon, though it’s still difficult to find in most dictionaries (which by and large overrepresent the old script). It means to travel in a purposeful manner towards an as-yet-unknown destination.62 Coddiwomple exemplifies not just getting lost but being lost, excitedly and intentionally, from the outset. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1371))
- But it breaks with tradition—and the majority of today’s life coaches—by letting go of the old script’s maxims: that “making it” is a fixed milestone, and “getting there” is a predetermined destination.63 In a coddiwomple world, “it” and “there” are constantly evolving, ever changing—and that is the essence of life. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1378))
- A coddiwompler has peace of mind because she’s not waiting to “become” someone or for something else to happen. She has left the old script at the side of the road and is forging her own path. ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1381))
- Adopt the mindset of a traveler. Even if your adventures are limited to one room, your backyard, or your neighborhood: What do you carry with you? What do you really know (versus think you know, or wish you knew about your environs)? What do you not know but could benefit from learning or exploring? ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1389))
- Notice the first emotion triggered when unexpected change arrives. Do you see a crisis or an opening? Do you see an apocalypse or a bardo? Spend time with these feelings and consider why they are your default. What happens if you try an alternative? ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1392))
- The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them. —ERNEST HEMINGWAY ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1411))
- If it is any consolation, today’s struggles with trust are not new. Trust has been a challenge throughout history. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1433))
- Botsman defines trust as “a confident relationship to the unknown.”67 Dictionaries call it “assured reliance on the character, ability, or truth of someone or something” or “dependence on something future or contingent; hope.” Clearly confidence, hope, and uncertainty play starring roles. ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1436))
- Together, this is called our horizon preference and affects how we perceive the world: when we have a high level of confidence—about ourselves, our surroundings, and the future—it’s easier to trust. When we have a low level of confidence about any of these things, our trust wobbles. Our hope turns to fear. ([Location 1439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1439))
- Trust is not just about confidence and hope, however. It’s also about intention. When fully expressed, trust is an invitation to repair and strengthen relationships, an invitation to express your credibility, your reliability, your authenticity, and your values. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1441))
- Trust and self-interest are inversely correlated: all else being equal, the greater your true intention to help others without personal benefit, the greater your trustworthiness (and the greater the “benefit” of being trustworthy). ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1444))
- I met more than a few people who took advantage of me and my grief along the way. But again and again, I saw that such people were the exception, not the rule. Most people are fundamentally good: they greet life, and others, with good intent. Each time I was reminded of this, I became a little bit more grounded: more capable, more confident, and less anxious whenever change hit. ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1451))
- Trust is the glue that holds people and society together: it is the master enabler of humanity and a safer, wiser world. Nevertheless, it can take years to build and be lost in a second. You know when it exists yet can’t point to it as you would a person or piece of furniture. It can only be earned, not given, even though many people try otherwise. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1463))
- When trust seems broken, assume good intent. ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1468))
- We have internalized and normalized the assumption that humans can’t be trusted. It’s not that you mistrust everyone automatically; rather, the default for many people is that the average individual cannot be trusted. In the process, mistrust becomes not only how we orient our daily lives but also an invisible yet pervasive constraint on our individual and collective dreams. Is this the way you wish to live your life, or how you wish to be seen by others? ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1473))
- In a world in flux, it becomes glaringly clear that trust is the glue that holds relationships, organizations, and cultures together. When the world flips upside down, trust is how you anchor and right yourself. Trusted relationships help you ride the rapids of change with confidence. Mistrust surrounds you with fear and cuts you off from others. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1484))
- Starting with trust doesn’t mean being naive (again, this is the old script at work). Nor does it mean there aren’t bad apples in society. The brilliant twist of this superpower is quite simple: treat untrustworthiness as the exception, rather than the norm. The effect is astonishing. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1486))
- Humans are naturally creative, curious, and trustworthy. ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1493))
- Trust is not built by marketing campaigns. Trust happens when we care for one another, look out for one another, and celebrate one another. ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1495))
- As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live. —Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1504))
- Systems designed from mistrust shut down our curiosity, shut us off, and disconnect us from one another. We kill the very things that otherwise bring our brilliance alive. When we design from mistrust, we often destroy the genius that’s in the room. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1512))
- My point is not that contracts and legal norms don’t matter. Quite the opposite: the rule of law and the ability to uphold it have never mattered more. What I am saying is that we have papered over fundamentally human connections with legalese, and in the process we have snipped the very relationships that hold society together. ([Location 1528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1528))
- Rather, we have designed so many things from the premise of mistrust of the average individual69 that we’ve crowded out the space for authentic trustworthiness to show up. ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1531))
- Inequality and mistrust are correlated. Within and among organizations, societies, countries, and cultures: the greater the inequality, the greater the mistrust. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1546))
- The connection between mistrust and inequality isn’t only an American problem. It’s a global nemesis, with extra damage to places with colonialist history. Part of colonialism’s role was and still is to keep a wall of mistrust between natives and colonizers, between locals and foreigners. Breaking down trust not only creates an “us vs. them” mentality, it also legitimizes structural inequality. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1555))
- According to satya, trust can come only by being truthful. Practicing satya requires a total commitment to truth: being truthful with ourselves and with others, in our words, actions, and intentions. When we are not truthful, we disconnect from our higher selves: our minds become confused and we cannot trust ourselves. With satya we can trust our inner wisdom and the outside world—including a world in flux. ([Location 1594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1594))
- If you are unable to trust, you are unable to feel. Trust is what opens you up to experience, engage, learn, and feel alive. When you are unable to feel, everything else in your system—including your personal power, identity, confidence, compassion, voice, perception, and intuition—can become blocked or, worse, cut off altogether. Trust is the fulcrum around which your potential revolves. ([Location 1603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1603))
- When you design from mistrust, you have to hide information: from employees, from customers, from friends, ironically from whomever you wish to placate (or, in less-inspiring terms, from whomever you wish to co-opt). ([Location 1653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1653))
- A good baseline is to conduct a “trust audit”: identify all of the places where trust is high, low, or nonexistent. Can you map these? Do you have an inkling of how mistrust crept in? Do you apply policies designed from mistrust to colleagues you have no reason not to trust? ([Location 1660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1660))
- With the old script, we saw vulnerability as a liability to design out of systems. With the new script and in a world in flux, we need to responsibly design vulnerability into systems in ways that actually boost resilience, allow for change and evolution, and wake up that part of our humanity that wants to connect and do the right thing. In the new script, vulnerability is an asset, not a liability. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1677))
- In times of low trust, high-trust leaders and organizations are even more attractive. In a world in flux, trust is your moral compass and differentiator. Trustworthiness distinguishes you from the old script of “business as usual.” Trust is what keeps customers coming back (without a marketing budget!) and bolsters your longevity. ([Location 1686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1686))
- In a world in flux, a culture of mistrust isn’t merely frustrating, inefficient, or unjust. In an environment of constant change, without trust among people, society begins to break. It is impossible to manage ongoing uncertainty without trust: it’s as if we’ve thrown our compasses and life jackets overboard while a storm rages at sea, even while many people on the boat recognize that our individual and collective survival depends on them. ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1693))
- It’s all rather out of control. But pay attention: by and large, these are echoes of the old script. They begin to dissolve when you write a new script centered on enough. This script is sustainable, inspiring, and human-centric. ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1746))
- In a world relentlessly striving for more, know your “enough.” ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1750))
- The truth is: no amount of physical stuff can ever replace your inner sense of worth, but it can easily bankrupt you (and harm the environment in the process). ([Location 1765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1765))
- Knowing your enough does not mean being miserly, uncharitable, or living in scarcity. If that’s your reaction (or your fear), you’ve misunderstood this superpower entirely. Knowing your enough is in fact the opposite of these things: it gives you room for generosity and plenitude.85 (A great irony of this superpower is that in a world focused on more, you’ll never find enough. Yet in a world focused on enough, you’ll immediately find more.) ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1772))
- Knowing your enough sees through the futility of comparison and empowers you to develop your own metrics of “enoughness” rooted in internal satisfaction, meaning, relationships, resilience, discovery, and helping others. Such metrics transcend a price tag. They don’t diminish the success of others: I am not “more” fulfilled than you, or vice versa, if we’re clear on our respective enoughs. To the contrary, we’re more capable of lifting one another up. ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1778))
- In Sweden, the national government’s strategy is to “protect people, not jobs.” The Swedish government has made it clear that no job (including yours) is guaranteed: a new technology (or a pandemic, changing tastes, or myriad other forces) may result in your job becoming obsolete. However, the government does guarantee that if your livelihood is disrupted, your well-being will be protected. ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1812))
- In the absence of basic income guarantees, affordable access to health care, and future-forward retraining programs, it’s easy to envision—even doing everything you’re supposed to—slipping towards “not enough.” ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1824))
- Leadership with the new script and a Flux Mindset would answer in terms of paying everyone enough, ensuring everyone feels safe and valued, and treating others as peers rather than subordinates. ([Location 1846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1846))
- It’s not that Kevin doesn’t care about money or profitability. Quite the opposite. But the lens through which he views these things is rooted in enough, which makes a profound difference. ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1859))
- In both Kevin’s and my own experience, if you’re not having a conversation about enough, then you’re leaving value (including money!) on the table. ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1861))
- Conversations about more tend to focus on transactions: how to do more deals, monetize more interactions, and make more money. The time frame is short: the sooner money can be made, the faster you can cash out. In this world, people are consumers: they are mere means to a monetized end. There is no genuine care for their well-being beyond their ability to pay. Conversations about enough, on the other hand, center on relationships: how to cultivate lifelong friendships, build sustainable and human-centric enterprise, and nourish the planet. The time frame is long: this is about lifetime leadership and evergreen legacies, with humanity at the core. ([Location 1862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1862))
    - Note: just feels like it leaves up the third option of growing the pie. this falls into the standard false dichotomy that our choices are too legit are part of the pie or divided the pie as equitably as possible. yet that is not the story of human innovation
- Leading with enough means nurturing relationships above all else: not for money, but for their inherent and often incalculable value. Relationships endure and sustain; deals are done and put on a shelf. Which do you want to be remembered for? ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1868))
- Since the 1980s, profit-sharing with rank-and-file workers has all but disappeared, particularly in large companies. Paradoxically, this is precisely the era in which profit-sharing with company executives began.90 The slice of workers for whom holistic well-being is taken into account narrowed to a fraction of what it had been. ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1883))
- To be clear, it’s not that capitalism is inherently flawed. Capitalism is a powerful and useful tool when used responsibly. Our challenge is that the current flavor of capitalism, as set forth in the old script, is toxic: it is addicted to more and allergic to enough. ([Location 1894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1894))
- Most people are not motivated by more money. Paying people enough is important, but beyond that its effect is negligible. ([Location 1913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1913))
- Yet think about how we structure compensation packages and develop metrics. We brag about making more money, but we rarely celebrate self-direction or nonmonetary satisfaction over salary. ([Location 1914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1914))
- We grasp for more: more status, more wealth, more certainty. Ironically, the more successful we’re seen to be, the more we worry about being “enough.” Yet this goal can’t be met. We can thank the “hedonic tread-mill” for this.94 When I’m on the hedonic treadmill (which I like to imagine is perched next to the hamster wheel), the satisfaction I get from success wears off quickly, like a drug high. ([Location 1917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1917))
- As investor and author Morgan Housel says, “Enough is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—will push you to the point of regret.” ([Location 1922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1922))
- In other words, the pursuit of more is futile. You will never reach your destination, because the mile marker will keep changing. And changing. And changing. ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1928))
- That is, until you fall ill, find yourself trapped by golden handcuffs, or are on your deathbed. At that point you realize that chasing ever more isn’t the point of life, nor does it give life meaning. Externally your life looks full, but integgrnally your spirit feels bankrupt. You wonder: what’s the point? ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1929))
- There is a big difference between “too much” and “not enough.” • Your enough depends on whether your worldview is one of abundance or scarcity. • Our current system is designed to keep people craving more, even as people yearn to be accepted as enough. • Today’s society has dangerous proxies for enough. The more you try to buy your way to love or fulfillment, the more alone and insufficient you’re likely to feel. • Inequality and basic security (income, food, housing, health) are catalysts for enough. • There is no such thing as too much love, too much compassion, or too much humanity. ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1941))
- New ideas, a new relationship, or a new haircut can undoubtedly boost your spirits and may even change your life. But the addition of each one also adds to your to-do list and increases the demands on your finite time. What if, instead of adding to reach your “more,” you subtracted to find your “enough?” ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1953))
- • Unsubscribe from one newsletter. • Remove an app from your phone. • Gently end a negative relationship. • Gracefully decline one invitation. • Cancel one subscription. • Let go of feeling guilty for an obligation. • Cut one workday free of meetings each week. • Sell the exercycle (or pick-your-choice-of-appliance) that you haven’t used in a decade. • Donate one item of clothing that you haven’t worn in ages. • Retire one hobby, club, or group that’s no longer inspiring you. • Turn off the television. Eliminate background noise. • Empty your cup instead of filling it. • Shed a mindset that is holding you back. • When you are tired, rest. ([Location 1957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1957))
- Subtracting not only simplifies our lives. It also creates time, space, and resources to focus on what really matters … which actually boosts your chances for fulfillment and success. ([Location 1966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1966))
- As Adam Grant showed in his seminal book Give and Take, the most successful people are the most generous people who also know when and how to ask for help.97 Generous leaders understand that having the greatest impact on the world means giving the most of ourselves, not acquiring the most for ourselves. To be more, give more. ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1972))
- When you strip away everything that is not authentically you, and everything that keeps you from experiencing the truth of who you are, you are able to bring more of your true self to life. By subtracting what you are not, you become all that you are. ([Location 1980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=1980))
- In times of great change, when the world is in flux, we need each other more than ever. We need one another’s support, wisdom, guidance, presence, and occasionally a shoulder to cry on. We need one another’s generosity. ([Location 2002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=2002))
- In other words, attaining “happiness” will always be outside your control. Moreover, it will be fleeting. Just as you attain it, it’s taken away. ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=2012))
- This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t strive to be happy … just beware of its limits. ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=2014))
- Contentment, on the other hand, is entirely within your power. Moreover, it can be permanent if you understand where it comes from and how to harness it. ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=2014))
- Knowing your enough brings you one step closer to contentment. Not needing to be more, and not desiring to be less. ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08Z3D14TC&location=2021))
