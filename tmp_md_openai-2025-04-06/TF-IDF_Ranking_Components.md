For search ranking, there's something that sounds like TD-INV or something like that. Remind me what it is and the components

I believe you are referring to "TF-IDF," which stands for "Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency." TF-IDF is a numerical statistic used in information retrieval and text mining to evaluate the importance of a term within a document relative to a collection of documents or a corpus. It is a widely used algorithmic technique for search engine ranking and text analysis.

TF-IDF consists of two main components:

1. Term Frequency (TF): This component measures the frequency of a term within a document. It represents how often a term appears in a document and is calculated by counting the number of occurrences of the term in the document.

2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): This component measures the importance of a term in the entire corpus. It is calculated by taking the logarithm of the total number of documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents containing the term. The IDF factor is higher for terms that appear in fewer documents and is lower for terms that are more common across the corpus.

The TF-IDF score for a term in a document is obtained by multiplying the TF and IDF components together. This score helps to determine the relevance of a document to a specific search query. Higher TF-IDF scores indicate that a term is both frequent in the document and rare across the corpus, suggesting it is an important term for that particular document.

Search engines often use TF-IDF as one of the many factors in their ranking algorithms to determine the relevance of documents to a given query. However, it's important to note that search engine ranking involves multiple other factors, such as page authority, backlinks, user engagement, and many more.
