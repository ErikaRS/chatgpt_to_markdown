Draft up a FLUX lens based on this prompt. The goal is to define a lens (short, with a general structure of example, definition, interesting exploration, practical takeaway) that includes just a bit of pun around it being episode 180 (keep it subtle)

Prompt: 
Dumb idea - we are at 180 - what about talking about "the 360". I've heard that bankruptcy lawyers are fundamentally different than other kinds of law because they are dealing with a fixed "pie", and anything they give up goes to someone else. Whereas in tech, it's a lot more of the 'blue ocean' or 'rising tide' where your win benefits me.

Sure! Here's a draft of a FLUX lens that weaves in the "180" nod, explores the fixed-pie vs. expanding-pie dynamic, and keeps it light with just a hint of wordplay:

### FLUX Lens: The 180° View (Or, When the 360 Isn’t)

**Example:**  
In bankruptcy law, the game is zero-sum. Every dollar that goes to one creditor is a dollar taken from another. There’s no growing the pie, only carving it up. Contrast this with much of tech, where collaboration and innovation can mean a bigger pie for everyone—your success lifts me, and vice versa.

**Definition:**  
The 180° View is a lens for recognizing when you're in a fixed-pie system (where gains are redistributed within a closed loop) versus an expanding-pie system (where new value can be created). While the full “360°” might imply endless cycles and mutual wins, the 180° is the stark halfway point—a boundary you can't just spin past. In some systems, what you gain *must* come from someone else's loss.

**Interesting Exploration:**  
What happens when we mistake a 180° environment for a 360° one? Tech, for all its blue-ocean optimism, often hits hard limits—whether in talent markets, attention economies, or infrastructure constraints. Suddenly, collaboration feels more competitive, and the rising tide becomes a scramble for scarce resources. Likewise, in supposedly fixed-pie situations like bankruptcy, creative restructuring can sometimes unlock unexpected value. So maybe the real trick is knowing when you're on a straight line versus a circle.

**Practical Takeaway:**  
Before making a move, ask: Are we playing a 180° game or a 360° one? Recognizing the difference can prevent misaligned incentives, pointless turf wars, or missed opportunities for growth. And sometimes, turning things around is just a matter of pivoting—halfway.

Would you like it to lean more playful with the “180” bit or stay more subtle like this?

### User - 2025-03-04 15:52:13

Rewrite this. The lens should be "fixed pie" building off of the concept from negotiation (https://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/fixed-pie/) and contrasting that to a rising tide / blue ocean perspective. The 180 reference should be worked in as a subtle nod to the title rather than the lens itself. E.g., with a sentence like "when you think about the world as a fixed pie, then whatever slice you can grasp it all you get, and the most win-win scenario is that 180 degree slice that gives you half the pie"

Got it! Here's a tighter, cleaner rewrite of the lens, centered on **Fixed Pie**, with the "180" as a subtle nod in the flow:

---

### FLUX Lens: Fixed Pie

**Example:**  
In bankruptcy law, the pie is fixed. Creditors, lawyers, and stakeholders are dividing up what remains, and every extra slice you take means someone else gets less. Compare that to the tech world, where growth mindsets reign and success often compounds—a rising tide, a blue ocean, a bigger pie for all.

**Definition:**  
The Fixed Pie lens comes from negotiation theory: it’s the belief that resources are finite, and gains are zero-sum. When you think about the world as a fixed pie, whatever slice you can grasp is all you get—and the most win-win outcome might just be that 180-degree slice that leaves everyone with half. In contrast, rising tide and blue ocean strategies reject fixed limits, aiming instead to expand the pie through innovation, collaboration, or market creation.

**Interesting Exploration:**  
Where this gets interesting is when we misapply one mindset to the other. If you treat a fixed-pie scenario like a blue ocean, you risk magical thinking, assuming growth will save you from hard tradeoffs. But if you approach an expansive opportunity like it’s a zero-sum fight, you might leave enormous value on the table by getting stuck in turf battles. Some systems are truly constrained. Others are waiting to be reinvented.

**Practical Takeaway:**  
Check your pie. Before you negotiate, collaborate, or strategize, pause to ask: Are we dividing what's left—or creating something new? The answer shapes how you play—and how much pie there is to go around.

Would you like it to lean a bit cheekier, or keep this balanced tone?

### User - 2025-03-04 15:52:48

Make it clearer that the fixed pie is considered an anti-pattern in negotiation theory

Thanks for the clarification! Here's a sharper version that makes clear the *fixed pie* is an anti-pattern in negotiation theory, while still contrasting it with the blue ocean/rising tide mindset and sliding in that subtle "180" nod:

Compare that to the tech world, where growth mindsets prevail and success often compounds—a rising tide, a blue ocean, a bigger pie for all.

**Definition:**  
The *Fixed Pie* mindset is a well-known trap in negotiation theory—an anti-pattern where people assume resources are limited and the only way to win is to take from others. It leads to zero-sum thinking and missed opportunities for value creation. When you see the world as a fixed pie, whatever slice you can grab is all there is—and the most generous, win-win scenario might just be that 180-degree split that leaves everyone with half. By contrast, rising tide and blue ocean strategies aim to expand the pie through innovation, collaboration, or opening new markets.

**Interesting Exploration:**  
Problems arise when we apply fixed-pie thinking in places built for growth. In tech, a scarcity mindset can turn potential partners into competitors and shrink possibilities before they even emerge. On the flip side, acting like you're in a blue ocean when you're actually carving up the remains of a finite system—like a distressed asset or a saturated market—can lead to magical thinking and painful missteps. The skill is recognizing whether you're in a world of fixed constraints or one ripe for expansion.

**Practical Takeaway:**  
Check your pie. Before you negotiate, collaborate, or strategize, pause to ask: Are we dividing what's left—or creating something new? The answer shapes not just how you play, but how much pie there is to go around.

Would you like this to push more into a tech-specific angle, or keep it broad like this?

### User - 2025-03-04 15:53:40

Change "tech world" to technological innovation. It's not just about the tech industry as it's conceied today. It's about technology and innovation in general.

Would you like the 180° nod to be any more pronounced, or is this the right level of subtle?

### User - 2025-03-04 15:56:02

In the exploration, add something about how a scarcity mindset can also lead to premature optimization or over-optimization that slices what what seems inessential but is actually load bearning
