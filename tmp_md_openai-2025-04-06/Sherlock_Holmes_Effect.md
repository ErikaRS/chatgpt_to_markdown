The concept you’re referring to is likely the “Sherlock Holmes effect.” Named after the fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, it refers to the ability to make deductions based on seemingly minor or obscure details, essentially reading between the lines to discover the truth.

Ah, you're probably thinking of a "Straussian reading." Named after the philosopher Leo Strauss, a Straussian reading involves interpreting a text by looking for hidden meanings or esoteric messages that the author might have embedded, often based on the idea that the author had to conceal their true thoughts due to political or social pressures. This method encourages readers to look beyond the surface and consider deeper, often hidden, implications.
