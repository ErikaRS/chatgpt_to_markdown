Based on my past reviews of business books, how would I describe a book that is full of excellent tools which are divided into chapters that are easy to consume independently but are also a bit hard to read continuously. They are hard to read continuously partially because the style straddles the lines between reference and narrative and partially because each chapter is so information dense that it is hard to consume more than a few chapters at a time even though they are short

Based on your past reviews of business books, you would likely describe the book as follows:

---

This book provides an excellent collection of practical tools and frameworks, neatly organized into chapters that can be easily consumed independently. Each chapter is packed with information, offering deep insights and actionable strategies. However, the book's style strikes a delicate balance between being a reference guide and a narrative, which makes it more suited for targeted, selective reading than a cover-to-cover approach. The density of the content, despite the chapters being relatively short, can make it challenging to read for long stretches. The sheer amount of valuable information, while useful, also means it's best digested in smaller portions. This structure makes the book highly valuable as a long-term resource for revisiting specific sections, but the reading experience can feel overwhelming if approached in a continuous fashion.

This description acknowledges the strengths of the book's tools while also explaining the challenges of reading it due to the dense and reference-like structure, something you've highlighted in past reviews.
