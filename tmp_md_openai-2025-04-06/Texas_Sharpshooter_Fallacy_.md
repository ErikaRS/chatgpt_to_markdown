What is a cute name for the phenomena described below: 
Our lens begins with an anecdote: to demonstrate their marksmanship, a clever Texan takes a bunch of shots at the side of the barn, and only then paints the target around the densest cluster of bullet holes.

A more general formulation of this particular logical fallacy is making conclusions while ignoring the differences in data and overemphasizing similarities. Or put differently, doing science in reverse by constructing hypotheses from experimental data that was intended to test them.

For example, an organization might claim credit for any progress or value created in the space that is adjacent to their scope. Or a person going for promotion might claim that they played a large role in the impact that happened in the team nearby. Or a team may tend to adjust their OKRs/goals to match the results they obtained.

In itself, it may seem like fairly innocent boasting or sandbagging. However, if performed often enough and broadly enough, it tends to lead to a fairly nasty habit. Since claiming wins is much easier than creating them the rewards flow to the wrong places. These misaligned incentives result in the evolution of teams that can't or won't take on legible goals because they don't have the knowhow to hit targets.

And if everyone is claiming to be a sharpshooter while mostly painting targets after the holes were made, it is nearly impossible to tell where the organization is going, or whether it’s actually doing anything. 

A good marker for spotting the Texas sharpshooter fallacy in an organization is when it appears that every person and team is astoundingly amazing and doing immensely impactful things – while overall, the organization is barely moving forward. In those situations we should look for the misaligned incentives in the system.
