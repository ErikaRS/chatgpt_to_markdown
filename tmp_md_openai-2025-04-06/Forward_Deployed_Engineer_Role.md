How do companies assess the success of a forward deployed engineering program?

### Assistant - 2024-04-18 18:14:48

Companies assess the success of a forward deployed engineering (FDE) program through several key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that reflect both the effectiveness of the engineers and the satisfaction of the clients they serve. Here are some of the main ways companies evaluate the success of these programs:

1. **Client Satisfaction**: This is often measured through surveys, feedback forms, and direct client testimonials. High client satisfaction indicates that the forward deployed engineers are effectively meeting the needs of the clients and resolving their issues.

2. **Implementation Success Rate**: Measuring the number of successful software deployments and integrations versus the total attempted. A high success rate suggests that the forward deployed engineers are effectively customizing and deploying the software.

3. **Issue Resolution Time**: Tracking how quickly engineers can resolve issues is a critical metric. Faster resolution times generally correlate with higher efficiency and client satisfaction.

4. **Client Retention and Renewal Rates**: Successful forward deployed engineering can lead to higher client retention rates, as satisfied clients are more likely to renew contracts and continue their business relationships.

5. **Revenue Impact**: Assessing the direct impact of FDE activities on revenue, such as through upsells or expanded contracts due to enhanced service and support, can provide a tangible measure of program success.

6. **Project Milestones**: Evaluating whether projects managed by forward deployed engineers are completed on time and within budget. Meeting or exceeding project milestones can indicate effective project management and technical execution.

7. **Employee Satisfaction and Turnover**: Since this role requires a combination of technical skills and client-facing abilities, measuring the job satisfaction of engineers and their turnover rates can help assess how well the company supports its forward deployed team.

8. **Feedback Loops and Product Improvements**: The effectiveness of the feedback mechanism whereby forward deployed engineers communicate client needs and issues back to the product team. Successful incorporation of this feedback into product development can lead to better software solutions.

By monitoring these metrics, companies can get a comprehensive view of how well their forward deployed engineering program is performing and where it might need adjustments to better serve clients and contribute to the company’s objectives.

What is the counterfactual for these metrics? How do companies tell the difference between situations where an FDE is doing well but not making a difference in the company's ability to deliver business value and situations where the FDE is a critical part of the success of the engagement? Assume that in both cases the FDE is doing high quality, useful work and people _like_ the program. Focus on how to really tell if it's making a difference

### Assistant - 2024-04-18 18:17:44

To determine whether a forward deployed engineer (FDE) is truly making a difference in a company's ability to deliver business value versus simply performing well in a role that might not be critical, companies can employ several strategies to assess the counterfactual—what would happen in the absence of the FDE's contributions. Here are some approaches to differentiating these scenarios:

1. **Controlled Experiments**: Companies can run controlled experiments where similar client engagements are managed with and without FDE involvement. By comparing outcomes like client satisfaction, implementation success, and revenue generation between the two groups, companies can quantify the added value brought by FDEs.

2. **Historical Comparisons**: Analyzing past projects or client engagements that were similar in scope but did not involve FDEs can provide insights. Comparing the metrics of these past projects to current ones that involve FDEs (like project delivery times, client satisfaction scores, and issue resolution effectiveness) can help identify the specific contributions of FDEs.

3. **Client Testimonials and Feedback**: Soliciting detailed feedback from clients specifically regarding the impact of FDE interventions on their business processes and outcomes can offer qualitative insights. Asking clients what differences they noticed, and what they believe would have happened without FDE involvement, can highlight the FDE's value.

4. **Opportunity Cost Analysis**: Assess what other tasks or projects could have been accomplished with the resources (time, money, personnel) allocated to the FDE program. If the outcomes of deploying resources elsewhere would likely have been less beneficial, this supports the business value of the FDE program.

5. **Incremental Revenue Analysis**: Measure the incremental revenue or business that can be directly attributed to the involvement of FDEs. This might include tracking upsells, cross-sells, or contract expansions that occurred because of the FDE's direct involvement and solutions.

6. **Dependency Analysis**: Evaluate how dependent successful outcomes are on the actions of FDEs. If projects or client relationships start showing a pattern of requiring FDE intervention for success, it indicates the critical nature of their role.

7. **Benchmarking Against Industry Standards**: Comparing the company's performance on relevant metrics (like client retention and implementation success) with industry averages can show whether the FDE program provides a competitive edge.

8. **A/B Testing on Service Models**: For new clients or projects, employing A/B testing where some clients receive standard engineering support and others receive enhanced FDE support can illustrate the impact of the FDE's work on project success and client satisfaction.

By employing these methods, companies can move beyond anecdotal evidence and subjective impressions, developing a more data-driven understanding of how FDEs contribute to—or are essential for—delivering business value. This analysis helps distinguish between scenarios where FDEs are liked and doing well but are not crucial, versus scenarios where they are integral to the success of the engagement.
