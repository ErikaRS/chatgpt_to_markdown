Come up wit a term for the second category of behaviors here. Preferably something that also starts with a 'c'

Impactful managers act as coaches, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute. However, impactful managers also ensure accountability by setting clear expectations, monitoring progress, and doing their part to keep projects on track. They balance empowerment with hands-on involvement to ensure that delivery standards and deadlines are consistently met.

For the second category of behaviors, here are a few options that start with 'c' and fit the theme:

1. **Catalysts**: Emphasizes driving action and ensuring progress without directly taking over.
2. **Custodians**: Highlights the role of maintaining accountability and ensuring quality standards.
3. **Champions**: Suggests advocating for and ensuring the success of projects and team goals.
4. **Coordinators**: Reflects involvement in monitoring and aligning activities to meet objectives.

Each of these terms pairs well with "coaches" while highlighting different aspects of ensuring accountability and delivery. Do any of these resonate with the approach you're describing?
