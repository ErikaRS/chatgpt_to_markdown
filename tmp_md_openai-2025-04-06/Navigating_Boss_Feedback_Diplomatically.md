My boss sometimes criticizes me for not being ruthless enough with interview candidates. However, people who work with us, even folks who like us both, generaly agree that I'm much better at building a high trust collaborative environment. Thus, I find this feedback super frustrating and just plain incorrect. What is the best way for me to respond in the moment that is respectful, doesn't fan the flames, but also doesn't pretend I accept the feedback. I've given up convincing him my way is right and just want to be able to do my job without distracting interference. (Note that this boss thinks he's good at listening to dissenting opinions but in practice he's pretty obsessively dismissive of feedback he disagrees with even if he doesn't say so aloud.)

The user has a boss who criticizes them for not being ruthless enough with interview candidates, but people generally agree that the user is better at building a high-trust collaborative environment. The user finds this feedback frustrating and incorrect, and they no longer try to convince their boss their approach is right. The user wants to respond respectfully without accepting the feedback, as their boss is dismissive of feedback he disagrees with.

Given the situation, it’s important to balance respect and assertiveness. Here’s a way to respond that acknowledges your perspective without escalating the situation or appearing to accept feedback you disagree with:

When your boss criticizes you, try saying something like: 

*"I understand that our approaches differ when it comes to interviews. I've found that my method has worked well in fostering collaboration and trust, which is important to our team dynamic. I'm focused on continuing to get strong results from the team in the way that works for me."*

This phrasing signals that you’ve heard the feedback, but also clarifies your commitment to your approach without inviting further debate. By emphasizing results and alignment with the team’s success, you can subtly reinforce your rationale without pushing back directly, which may help prevent unnecessary friction.

Is there an even more concise version. Something that's as little more than "thanks for sharing" as it takes to not be dismissive

You could try something as simple as:

*"I hear you. I’ve seen good results from my approach, and I’ll keep focusing on that."*

This keeps it respectful and acknowledges the feedback without dismissing it, while subtly reinforcing your approach and results.
