    - Stanley and Lehman explore the myth of the objective. When we focus on ambitious objectives—concrete, specific goals—we are setting ourselves up for failure. Objectives can be useful when we're looking at changes that are adjacent to where we already are. However, when our goal is major innovation, objectives actively hinder progress. The path between where we are today and the objective is often indirect and may require moving away from a seemingly direct path.
    - The authors refer to these intermediate discoveries as stepping stones. The myth of the objective assumes that the best way to pursue an objective is to follow the stepping stones that are nearest to the ultimate goal: the objective becomes the objective __function__. But this is like trying to go through a maze by always taking the path that points toward the exit. The true path is much more roundabout. The objective is a false compass. 
    - This might not be so bad if we had good visibility of the possible paths between here and there. However, to continue with the stepping stone metaphor, these stepping stones are in a foggy landscape. The objective is tempting because we cannot see the full set of paths available to us. We want some way to navigate through the fog. However, as the authors emphasize, following a false compass is no better than not having one. Although I find their claim about objectives as a false compass compelling in the end, I did find the argument itself to be fairly weak. It was mostly argued from example and focused rather too much on the exact paths by which innovations were reached: sure, our path to computers involved vacuum tubes, but that doesn't mean that vacuum tubes were the only path to computers (especially given that we didn't __stay__ at vacuum tubes). 
    - If objectives provide a false compass, what are we to do? Do we just wander around randomly and hope for good luck? No. We can be more intentional than that. The authors encourage us to utilize non-objective search. Instead of measuring progress against a destination, exploration is driven by some measurement relative to the present. 
    - This measurement has two parts. First, there are constraints or backstops. Some paths should be avoided because we cannot actually make our way through them. Constraints include physical laws (e.g., the speed of light), continued ability to participate (an organism that dies too quickly can't reproduce), and domain specific requirements (medicine should not do harm). Constraints tell you where not to go. Second, there should be something points us in a direction. The authors are particularly fond of novelty search, which follows the direction that is most interesting (for some domain relevant definition of interesting). The important part is that both constraints and guiding principles are relative to the present, not to some unrealized future state. __From here__, don't go a direction that will kill you. __From here__, go the direction which looks the most interesting. 
    - This general idea is not completely incompatible objectives. The authors argue convincingly that we shouldn't use objectives as objective functions, as the measure of which direction is best to go. That will cause us to miss necessary detours. However, can't we use objectives as part of a more nuanced guiding methodology? The authors encourage us to completely abandon objectives. Instead of trying to have any control over the direction we go, if we want to be innovative, we should become treasure hunters. We should always follow the path that is the most interesting. That path may lead us places that are incredibly innovative, but we won't know where we are going in advance. 
    - I didn't find this part of the argument completely compelling.Overall, I still feel like objectives can be useful. I agree that treasure hunting is __one__ way to innovate. It may be the only way to achieve truly groundbreaking innovations. However, there is a spectrum between objective-friendly adjacent inventions and major innovation. Even if we cannot achieve an objective in full, the interesting things we discovery on the way will likely be more aligned with the goal of the objective than if we just wander about following what is interesting or novel—even if we can't solve world hunger, trying is likely to at least reduce hunger. The problems come when we conflate objectives—places we want to go—with objective functions—measures of how close we are to being there. 
    - However, I do agree that objectives make terrible fitness functions. If we measure progress only by measuring distance from the ideal, then we'll likely get stuck at a boring dead end. I agree with the fundamental assertion that when we are determining which next step to take, we should use an objective function that measure progress relative to where we are now, not relative to some particular place we want to be.
    - Maybe instead of objectives we can think of north stars. A north star is something which guides your direction. It is not a destination you can ever reach. A north star reduces the number of next steps to consider. Since we never expect to reach a north star, we don't measure success against the north star. Rather, we measure success by what we achieved while going that direction. Let's replace the objective, in the negative sense used in this book, with the north star. Let's allow ourselves to wander, and also allow ourselves a general direction to that wandering. Perhaps Stanley and Lehman might say that makes a north star more like a constraint, something which defines which directions not to go. However, from a psychological perspective, I think that the positive framing of a north star is more inspiring than a constraint. 
    - Despite the fact that this book was not as well argued as I would like, I believe that it was worth the read because it caused me to think more deeply about objectives rather than just blindly accepting them as the way things should be done.
- An essay::
    - I recently finished reading [__Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned__](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25670869-why-greatness-cannot-be-planned). The basic thesis is that setting objectives is futile for significant innovation. Objectives can be useful for incremental improvements, but for innovation, we do not know that the path that progress requires. Measuring incremental improvements against the final goal is likely to result in the pursuit of dead ends that seem like they should be moving closer but which are actually missing a vital stepping stone. The vital stepping stones usually require going in a non-obvious direction. You can read more in [my goodreads review ](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3547109271).
    - As [[Dart Lindsley]] noted in our [[GALE]] book club discussion of this book, the argument presented in the book is somewhat lacking. It focuses overly much on the particular path that was used to get to some interesting end. E.g., "Computers are great! They needed vacuum tubes. Who would have thought __that__ when first trying to invent computers?" Dart observes this assumes that reaching a particular objective is fully path dependent: there is only one particular way to get there from here. In practice, there are likely to be multiple ways to get to a particular end. Vacuum tubes may have been how we first got to scalable computation, but they likely were not the only path to silicon. Bicycles may have been one path to commercial flight, but that doesn't mean they're the only one.

Your summary of *Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned* effectively captures the book's central argument: objectives, while useful for incremental improvements, can hinder true innovation. You highlight how the authors critique the typical goal-setting approach by emphasizing the importance of stepping stones and non-objective search, where progress is measured relative to the present rather than a distant future goal. Your reflection on the balance between objectives and exploration, particularly your suggestion of a "north star" as a guiding principle, adds a nuanced perspective that complements the book's argument.

It’s also interesting how you compare the "north star" concept to constraints, emphasizing the psychological motivation of positive framing over purely limiting factors. This balance between following an inspirational direction and allowing room for discovery seems like a healthy way to incorporate innovation into structured thinking. You also touch on the book's limitations, particularly how it focuses too much on specific examples of innovation, which can narrow the argument's applicability.

Your engagement with the book, especially your mention of the GALE book club discussion, adds depth to the review, showing how it spurred further thinking. While you express some dissatisfaction with the book’s argumentation, your takeaway—that the book prompted you to reflect more critically on objectives—suggests that it served its purpose despite its weaknesses.

This summary balances a fair critique with personal insights, which can be helpful to others considering reading it. Would you like to expand on any of the connections mentioned, such as the link to *The Tyranny of the Ideal* or Scott Page's work?
