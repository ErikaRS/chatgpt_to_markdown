Noodle on this and come up with a concise taxonomy of prompts, tools, and agents. 

How do Agents overlap with Prompts? Or rather what does this mean for Prompts?
Aravind Ramaraju: Based on conversations with Quinn Slack, we will figure out how to uplevel Prompts to make it fit into the Agents messaging, with the ability to add tool calling into Prompts. This will not be done for Dec 12th, and needs more thought to hash out

Erika: To me, part of the answer to this question is that agents should be orchestrating several steps, whether that's multiple LLM calls or mixing LLM calls with other things like context fetching or graph expansions. A prompt is a one shot component that may be part of a larger agent. In my opinion, I see tool usage as different from agents, and I don't think prompts using tools necessarily makes them an agent.

Hereâ€™s a concise taxonomy and analysis of prompts, tools, and agents, as well as their overlaps:

### **Taxonomy**
1. **Prompts**:
   - **Definition**: Single-shot or modular inputs designed to elicit responses from a language model (LLM).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Focused and specific.
     - Stateless; they do not retain or manage a process over time.
     - Can be standalone or embedded within a larger sequence.

2. **Tools**:
   - **Definition**: External functionalities or APIs that extend LLM capabilities (e.g., querying a database, executing code, fetching context).
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Activated by the LLM to perform tasks beyond its intrinsic capabilities.
     - Often require explicit invocation through tool-calling interfaces.
     - Provide deterministic or external outputs integrated into LLM workflows.

3. **Agents**:
   - **Definition**: Orchestrated systems that manage and execute complex tasks through multiple steps, potentially combining LLMs, tools, and additional logic.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Stateful; maintain context across steps or tasks.
     - Can mix LLM interactions with external processes (e.g., chaining prompts, context fetching, or running tools).
     - Operate with autonomy and decision-making, guided by high-level goals or instructions.

### **Overlap and Relationships**
1. **Prompts and Agents**:
   - **Overlap**: Prompts are foundational components of agents, used as building blocks for individual decisions or steps.
   - **Impact on Prompts**:
     - **Modular Design**: Prompts need to be designed with flexibility for integration into broader agent workflows.
     - **Context-Awareness**: Agents may require prompts to dynamically adapt based on state or previous steps.
     - **Multi-Step Coordination**: Prompts may need to interact with multiple data points, making their design inherently more sophisticated in agent contexts.

2. **Prompts and Tools**:
   - **Overlap**: Prompts can invoke tools as extensions of their functionality but remain single-shot instructions unless incorporated into an agent framework.
   - **Implications**:
     - Prompts with tool-calling do not inherently make them agents; they are still executing a discrete action without orchestration.
     - Adding tool support to prompts blurs their boundaries with agent-like behavior but stops short of full autonomy.

3. **Tools and Agents**:
   - **Overlap**: Tools are components that agents can call upon as part of their orchestrated workflows.
   - **Distinction**:
     - Tools are functional endpoints; they do not possess the decision-making or process management characteristics of agents.

### **Key Takeaways for Evolving Prompts**
- **Integration with Agents**:
  Prompts in an agent-driven context need to:
  - Be modular and reusable across diverse workflows.
  - Handle dynamic inputs informed by an agent's state or history.
  - Enable multi-step reasoning by chaining outputs into subsequent prompts or actions.

- **Tool-Calling in Prompts**:
  - This enriches prompt functionality but does not convert prompts into agents.
  - Prompts using tools should be thought of as **enhanced components** rather than autonomous systems.

- **Agents Messaging**:
  - Agents should be positioned as **compositional frameworks** where prompts, tools, and other logic work together.
  - Prompts gain their fullest utility within agents, but agents transcend prompts by orchestrating tools, managing state, and autonomously iterating toward goals.
