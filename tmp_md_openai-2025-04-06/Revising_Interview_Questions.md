I am revising some interview questions after having asked them a couple times. Help by suggesting revisions. 

Question: Tell us about a time when you've collaborated with engineering teams on an initiative with a large number of stakeholders.
Problem to solve: It's not clear what the point of asking this question is.

Question: Follow-up: Can you delve deeper into the technologies that were employed in the project and describe the trade-offs you had to make?
Problem to solve: None. Goal is to see if candidate is generally familiar with the technology they are using. 

Question: Can you provide an example of a challenging project you've managed in the past?
Problem to solve: It's not clear what this question is getting at.

Question: How do you handle communication and alignment with stakeholders, especially when it comes to setting clear objectives and addressing risks and blockers? Can you provide an example of a situation where your communication skills were crucial to project success?
Problem to solve: It's too complicated, too much is going on. (Maybe move some of the complexity into another question?)
Proposed alternative: Break it into two questions:
- Describe a time when your comminication skills were crucial to helping align with stakeholders?
- Describe a situation where unexpected risks and blockers came up and how you handled it?

Question: Describe a scenario where you had to work closely with engineering teams to resolve a technical bottleneck or issue that was impeding project progress. How did you collaborate to overcome the challenge?
Problem to solve: None on its own, but feels redundant with the next question.

Can you describe a situation where you proactively identified and addressed technical risks or blockers that could have affected project outcomes? How did you mitigate these challenges?
Problem to solve: None on its own but feels redundant with the previous.

Question: Having past experience in development is a plus. Can you discuss your experience with software development and how it has shaped your approach to program management?
Problem to solve: None
