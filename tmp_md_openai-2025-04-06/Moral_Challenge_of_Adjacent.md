Turn this into a piece in the flux essay style: 

It's harder to deal with morally problematic things that are still in our societal adjacent possible than ones that aren't. (Why middling old books can be harder to handle then older ones)

### The Moral Haze of the Adjacent Possible: Why Middling Old Books Challenge Us More Than Ancient Ones

In the vast library of human thought, there are volumes that stand as proud monuments of moral clarity, untouched by time's erosion. These are the ancient texts, whose distance from our present lives grants them a form of clarity—whether we venerate them as wisdom or dismiss them as relics of a less enlightened age. But then, there are those books that reside in the murky space of the "adjacent possible," texts that are neither ancient nor contemporary, but suspended in a twilight zone of moral ambiguity. These middling old books, often decades but not centuries old, pose a unique challenge to our ethical sensibilities.

Why is it that these books, written in a time still within reach of living memory, often feel more unsettling than their much older counterparts? The answer lies in the tension between our evolving moral framework and the proximity of these works to our current societal norms. They emerge from a world that is recognizable yet disturbingly different, close enough that we can see our present selves reflected in them, but far enough that the reflection is distorted. 

These texts occupy a space that is still in our societal adjacent possible—a concept that refers to the realm of ideas, practices, and norms that, while not yet fully realized, are within the reach of our cultural evolution. The adjacent possible is where society teeters on the edge of transformation, where the potential for change is palpable, but the past's grip remains firm. Middling old books, then, are uncomfortable precisely because they dwell in this liminal space. They are close enough to our current values that their shortcomings are glaring, but distant enough that we can't simply dismiss them as irrelevant to our modern lives.

The unease we feel when engaging with these works stems from their ability to highlight the gaps in our moral progress. When we read an ancient text that upholds values we now find reprehensible, we can easily attribute its flaws to the vast chasm of time and cultural change that separates us. We might critique, analyze, and learn from it, but we do so with the assurance that we are better, more enlightened, than those who came before us.

In contrast, when we encounter a middling old book that espouses views now considered morally problematic, the distance is too short for comfort. The author might be someone who lived in the same world as our grandparents, or even our parents. Their words reflect a mindset that, while outdated, still lingers at the edges of our societal consciousness. We can see how those ideas influenced the world we live in today, and that makes them harder to dismiss. The moral failures of these texts are not relics of a bygone era; they are echoes of a past that is still with us, complicating our sense of moral superiority.

Moreover, these works challenge us to confront the uncomfortable truth that our current values are not the final destination of moral progress. Just as we judge the past, future generations will judge us. The middling old books serve as a mirror, reflecting not only where we have been but also where we might still be vulnerable to the same moral failings we criticize in others.

In this way, the middling old books are a test of our moral maturity. Can we engage with them critically without dismissing them out of hand? Can we recognize their historical context while also holding them accountable to our present values? Can we use them as tools for reflection, rather than as mere artifacts of a less enlightened time?

The challenge, then, is to navigate the moral haze of the adjacent possible, to engage with these texts in a way that acknowledges their place in our cultural evolution while also striving to transcend the limitations they reveal in our current moral framework. It is a delicate balance, but one that is essential if we are to continue moving forward, not just as readers, but as a society.

Don't make it be about middling old books. Make that just an example to illustrate a broader point about how we judge things based on how far they are from our current adjacent possible.

### The Moral Haze of the Adjacent Possible: Navigating Our Judgment of What’s Near and Far

In the landscape of human judgment, we find ourselves constantly navigating the tension between what is comfortably distant and what is unsettlingly close. This tension plays out not only in our personal lives but in our collective moral and ethical frameworks. One of the more subtle and pervasive dynamics in this process is how we handle morally problematic issues depending on their proximity to what we consider our current adjacent possible—the realm of ideas, practices, and norms that are just within reach of becoming our new reality.

When we encounter something that lies far outside our current societal norms, we often find it easier to pass judgment, whether that means condemning it outright or simply dismissing it as irrelevant. Ancient practices, long-dead ideologies, and archaic laws from centuries ago are often relegated to the category of the "obviously wrong." They are so distant from our present understanding that our judgments are swift and firm. We might study these practices as historical curiosities or cautionary tales, but they rarely provoke the kind of deep moral discomfort that forces us to reflect on our own beliefs.

But what happens when the morally problematic thing is not so far removed from our current adjacent possible? This is where the moral haze sets in, where our clarity falters, and where the challenge to our ethical self-assurance begins. The closer an idea or practice is to our present reality, the harder it becomes to dismiss, and the more difficult it is to render a clear moral verdict.

Take, for instance, the example of middling old books. These are works from a few decades ago, written by authors who are still remembered, whose world is not so different from our own. Unlike ancient texts, these books often carry views that are only just out of step with current values. They represent a world we can still recognize, even if we don't fully inhabit it anymore. And this proximity makes them uncomfortable. We see in them the reflection of a world that is almost ours, and in doing so, we are forced to confront the uncomfortable possibility that the ideas they espouse are not entirely alien to us.

This dynamic is not limited to literature. We see it play out in our judgment of social norms, political ideologies, and cultural practices. Consider the shifting views on issues like gender roles, environmental stewardship, or technological ethics. Practices that were widely accepted just a generation ago are now seen as deeply problematic, yet they are not so distant that we can easily write them off. They are still in our adjacent possible, and as such, they demand a more nuanced engagement.

The challenge is that these close-to-home issues force us to confront the evolution of our own moral compass. When something lies within or near our adjacent possible, it suggests that we, too, could have easily subscribed to those views or practices, and perhaps we still do in some subtle ways. This realization blurs the lines of judgment, making it harder to claim the moral high ground.

Furthermore, the proximity of these issues to our current norms often reveals the ongoing process of moral negotiation that society is engaged in. Unlike distant practices that are fixed in their wrongness, these adjacent issues are still in flux, still being debated and redefined. This makes our engagement with them less about judgment and more about participation in the shaping of our collective future.

The middling old books, then, serve as a metaphor for this broader phenomenon. They remind us that our discomfort often arises not from the overtly alien, but from the almost familiar—the ideas and practices that we recognize as part of our cultural lineage, yet also see as needing to evolve. The moral haze of the adjacent possible forces us to acknowledge that our current values are not the endpoint of ethical progress, but rather, points on an ongoing journey.

As we navigate this journey, we must be willing to engage with the morally ambiguous, to grapple with the ideas that are just close enough to challenge us. It requires a balance of humility and critical thinking—a recognition that the line between right and wrong is not always as clear as we might like, especially when it comes to those things that dwell in the shadows of our adjacent possible.

Start the essay with a concrete example, something along the lines of: "Imagine a book or movie from your childhood which has not aged well. It's probably easy to find something that you loved at the time but which now contains elements that make you uncomfortable. It no longer flies in today's landscape. Now imagine something older which has some problematic themes but doesn't make you uncomfortable, maybe the class and gender themes in _Pride and Prejudice_. Why is it that it seems that works follow an u-shaped curve from acceptable, to unacceptable, and back again?"

### The Moral Haze of the Adjacent Possible: Navigating Our Judgment of What’s Near and Far

Imagine a book or movie from your childhood that has not aged well. Perhaps it was a beloved film that now contains jokes or stereotypes that make you cringe. It’s easy to find something that you once loved but that no longer flies in today’s landscape, with its more evolved social norms. Now, contrast this with something even older—say, the class and gender dynamics in *Pride and Prejudice*. Despite its problematic themes, you might not feel the same level of discomfort. It’s a classic, a product of its time, and somehow, that distance makes it easier to accept or overlook its flaws. 

Why is it that works often seem to follow a U-shaped curve in our moral judgment—starting as acceptable, becoming unacceptable as our norms evolve, and then, after more time has passed, returning to a place of cautious acceptance or even reverence?

This phenomenon reflects the way we navigate the moral terrain of the adjacent possible—the realm of ideas, practices, and norms that are within our cultural reach but not yet fully integrated into our present reality. The closer something is to this adjacent possible, the more challenging it becomes to judge, because it’s not just a relic of the past; it’s a near reflection of the present, a version of ourselves that we can almost touch.

When we encounter something far removed from our current reality, like the social structures in *Pride and Prejudice*, it’s easier to approach it with a sense of detachment. We recognize its limitations, but the historical and cultural distance allows us to contextualize it without feeling personally implicated. It exists in a world so different from ours that our moral judgment is cushioned by time.

In contrast, consider the discomfort you feel when revisiting that childhood favorite, now laced with outdated views on race, gender, or social norms. These works are close enough in time that they belong to a world we still recognize, a world that shaped us. They are part of our adjacent possible—a version of society that was not so long ago—and that proximity makes their flaws harder to dismiss. The moral shortcomings of these works are not merely historical quirks; they are reminders of how recently our society tolerated or even embraced those views.

This proximity complicates our judgment. When something lies within or near our adjacent possible, it suggests that the ideas it contains are not as alien as we might like to believe. We see echoes of those ideas in today’s world, and this recognition forces us to confront the uncomfortable possibility that our own beliefs and practices might someday be seen in the same harsh light.

The U-shaped curve in our judgment of cultural works, then, is a reflection of this dynamic. As time passes, the works move further from our adjacent possible, and the discomfort diminishes. What was once too close to critique without implicating ourselves becomes distant enough to analyze dispassionately. Eventually, these works can even be re-evaluated, their flaws acknowledged but understood as part of a different era’s mindset.

This pattern is not limited to books and movies. It applies to social norms, political ideologies, and cultural practices across the board. Consider how society’s views on issues like gender roles, environmental ethics, or technological progress have shifted over the decades. Practices that were mainstream a generation ago are now seen as deeply problematic, yet they are not so far removed that we can dismiss them entirely. They are still in our adjacent possible, still part of the ongoing moral negotiation that shapes our collective future.

As we engage with these issues, we must be mindful of the moral haze that comes with proximity to our adjacent possible. It’s easy to judge what’s far away, but the real challenge lies in grappling with what’s close to home, in recognizing that our current values are not the endpoint of ethical progress. The discomfort we feel when confronted with the flaws of the recent past is a sign that we are still evolving, still working to align our society with the ideals we strive for.

Navigating this moral terrain requires humility and critical thinking. We must be willing to engage with the uncomfortable, to critique not just the distant past but also the near one, and to recognize that the process of moral progress is ongoing. The U-shaped curve reminds us that what seems clear-cut today may look very different in the future, and that the journey of ethical reflection is never truly complete.

Weave in themes of the value of learning from what is old. The present does not have a monopoly on wisdom, and there are things to learn from works of every era (although not from every work). But wisdom requires both a core in the work itself and receptive soil in the listener.

### The Moral Haze of the Adjacent Possible: Navigating Our Judgment of What’s Near and Far

Imagine a book or movie from your childhood that has not aged well. Perhaps it was a beloved film that now contains jokes or stereotypes that make you cringe. It’s easy to find something you once loved but that no longer fits within today’s more evolved social norms. Now, contrast this with something even older—say, the class and gender dynamics in *Pride and Prejudice*. Despite its problematic themes, you might not feel the same level of discomfort. It’s a classic, a product of its time, and somehow, that distance makes it easier to accept or overlook its flaws.

Why is it that works often seem to follow a U-shaped curve in our moral judgment—starting as acceptable, becoming unacceptable as our norms evolve, and then, after more time has passed, returning to a place of cautious acceptance or even reverence?

This phenomenon reflects how we navigate the moral terrain of the adjacent possible—the realm of ideas, practices, and norms that are just within our cultural reach but not yet fully integrated into our present reality.

We recognize its limitations, but the historical and cultural distance allows us to contextualize it without feeling personally implicated. It exists in a world so different from ours that our moral judgment is cushioned by time. 

Yet, while these distant works might seem easier to forgive, they still hold value—perhaps even more so—because they carry with them the wisdom of another era. The present does not have a monopoly on wisdom. There are things to learn from every era, even if not from every work. The challenge is to sift through these old ideas, discerning what is of lasting value and what is best left in the past. 

Wisdom requires two things: a core of truth within the work itself and receptive soil in the listener. The core of truth might be hidden within layers of outdated norms or archaic language, but it’s there, waiting to be uncovered by those who approach with an open mind. The receptive soil is our willingness to engage with the past, to see beyond its flaws, and to find the enduring lessons that still resonate today.

In contrast, consider the discomfort you feel when revisiting that childhood favorite, now laced with outdated views on race, gender, or social norms. These works are close enough in time that they belong to a world we still recognize, a world that shaped us.

What was once too close to critique without implicating ourselves becomes distant enough to analyze dispassionately. Eventually, these works can even be re-evaluated, their flaws acknowledged but understood as part of a different era’s mindset.

Yet, as we move along this curve, we must remember the value of learning from what is old. The distant past offers us a unique perspective, free from the immediacy of contemporary concerns. It allows us to see the broader patterns of human thought and behavior, to recognize the core truths that transcend time. But this wisdom is not automatic; it requires effort. We must be willing to engage with the past critically and thoughtfully, separating the enduring insights from the outdated trappings.

This pattern is not limited to books and movies. It applies to social norms, political ideologies, and cultural practices across the board. Consider how society’s views on issues like gender roles, environmental ethics, or technological progress have shifted over the decades.

The wisdom of the past—if we are wise enough to receive it—can guide us as we continue to move forward, not just as individuals, but as a society.
