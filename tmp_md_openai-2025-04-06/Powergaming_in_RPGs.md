In role-playing games, a character that is built with overpowered stats is commonly referred to as a "munchkin" or sometimes called "min-maxing" a character. The term "munchkin" is used more in a derogatory sense, implying that the player is focusing excessively on making their character as powerful as possible, often at the expense of story or role-playing integrity. "Min-maxing" refers to the practice of minimizing certain stats or traits to maximize others, optimizing the character's effectiveness in certain aspects of the game. This can lead to unbalanced gameplay where such a character dominates the game, reducing fun for other players.
