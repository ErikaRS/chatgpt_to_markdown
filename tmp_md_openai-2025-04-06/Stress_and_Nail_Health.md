Why do fingernails seem more brittle when you're stressed?

When you're stressed, your body undergoes physiological changes that can affect nail health in several ways:

1. **Cortisol and Nutrient Depletion** – Chronic stress increases cortisol levels, which can interfere with the absorption of essential nutrients like biotin, iron, and zinc—key contributors to strong nails.

2. **Reduced Blood Circulation** – Stress can cause vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), leading to reduced blood flow to extremities, including the nails. This can slow nail growth and make them more prone to brittleness.

3. **Dehydration and Skin Barrier Disruption** – Stress can lead to dehydration, which affects the nail bed and makes nails dry and brittle. It can also weaken the skin barrier, making nails more prone to damage.

4. **Increased Nail Picking or Biting** – Many people unconsciously pick at or bite their nails when stressed, leading to further weakening or breakage.

5. **Hormonal Imbalances** – Stress impacts hormones like estrogen and thyroid hormones, both of which influence nail strength. An imbalance can lead to brittle, slow-growing nails.

6. **Oxidative Stress** – Chronic stress increases oxidative damage, which weakens keratin, the protein that forms nails.

If your nails are feeling more brittle than usual, focusing on hydration, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques might help restore their strength.
