Certainly! Understanding the structure of a web URL is essential to grasping how the internet is organized. Let's break down the terms you've mentioned:

1. **Domain**: 
   - The domain is essentially the core part of the web address or URL, which identifies a particular web resource. It's the human-readable address that we use to access websites on the internet, making it easier than remembering IP addresses.
   - Example: In the URL `https://www.example.com`, `example.com` is the domain.

2. **Subdomain**: 
   - A subdomain is a subset or a smaller part of the primary domain. It is used to organize and navigate to different sections of a website or to point to different web resources under the same primary domain. It appears before the main domain.
   - Example: In the URL `https://blog.example.com`, `blog` is the subdomain of the primary domain `example.com`.

3. **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**:
   - The TLD is the last segment of the domain name. It's the part that follows immediately after the "dot" symbol. TLDs are part of the domain hierarchy used to organize domain names. They can often provide a clue about the website's purpose, origin, or the organization that owns it.
   - Common generic TLDs include `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, etc. There are also country-code TLDs like `.us` (for the United States), `.uk` (for the United Kingdom), `.ca` (for Canada), and so on.
   - Example: In the URL `https://www.example.com`, `.com` is the top-level domain.

To visualize the relationship:

```
Subdomain    Domain    TLD
   |           |        |
   v           v        v
https://blog.example.com
```

In this example:
- `example` is the second-level domain.
- `.com` is the top-level domain.
- `blog` is the subdomain.

You can have multiple subdomains for a single domain, and they can be used for different purposes, like separating a blog (`blog.example.com`), a store (`shop.example.com`), or a development environment (`dev.example.com`) from the main site.
