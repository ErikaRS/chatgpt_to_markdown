Throughout the review period, I believe my performance as co-Head of Engineering has aligned with the expectations for my role, level, and our values.


Specific examples include:

Collaboration and Leadership:
Successfully shared the Head of Engineering role with Steve.
Fostered open communication across teams (e.g., Product Platform & Code Search, Code Search & Cody, teams within Cody, Infra & Code Search).
Transitioned to sole Head of Engineering.
Proactively working with Aimee to improve TS/Eng collaboration.
Strategic Initiatives:
Led the Graph team towards embracing a new direction focused on improving zero-config experiences.
Spearheaded the collaboration between Infrastructure and Code Search to move to monthly releases.
Helped Code Search transition to a clear focus on lovability, leading to significant improvements in the Code Search UI.
Organizational structure:
Took proactive steps in adjusting the team structure and composition to be more effective including
Hired an EM Product Platform (starting March 4!!!)
Helped plan and implement the August reorg and layoffs
Planned and implemented team changes for Steve's role change
Worked through 2 EMs transitioning back to ICs
Involved in both PM & TPM interviews.
Feedback and Development:
Updated the engineering ladder.
Actively mentored both managers and ICs not in my reporting chain (at the time).
Frequently provided feedback to product about strategy, process, and product/design decisions.
Operational Excellence:
Efficiently managed logistics like All Hands planning, budgeting, and software audits, ensuring smooth operations within the engineering department.
Ensured that the February release was low risk for Code Search, Infrastructure, and Product Platform.
Worked closely with product to ensure that we had clear guidelines and effective execution for 2 product focused planning cycles.


Areas for improvement**:**

Workload Management: Managing dual roles of team leadership and Head of Engineering has been challenging, especially with the departure of Thorsten. This indicates a need for improved delegation and possibly expanding the leadership team to distribute responsibilities more effectively. Fortunately, Matthew is starting soon!
Communicating broadly: I did not do enough to make sure that important changes, like moving to monthly releases and expectations around priority 24x7 support, were communicated broadly enough, leading to confusion.
Next 12-months: What goals are you setting for yourself over the next 12 months to be successful?

Self
Top level:

Unify Cody & Code Search
Grow mDAU
Increase Code Search usage
Increase Cody retention and usage

Strategic Planning and Execution:

Work with Product to define a roadmap for unifying Cody & Code Search. Execute on this roadmap.
Work with engineering leaders to define an architectural roadmap that pays back tech debt incurred in the rush toward GA and enables the team to move quickly.
Continue to release core features that improve growth and lovability of Cody & Code Search. Invest some (but not too much) in features to drive down enterprise readiness debt.
Team and Leadership Development:

Improve clarity and collaboration within the Cody teams. Hire a manager for the Cody teams (if I can get the budget)
Transition the Product Platform team to the new EM, allowing me to focus fully on Head of Engineering responsibilities
Continue to develop the managers in my team and refine my organizational structure (the best reorg is the one that happens one small, timely change at a time)
Revise the EM ladder to ensure it reflects current needs and promotes career growth within the engineering management team.

Operational Excellence and Process Improvement:

Continue to improve collaboration between engineering and GTM.
Continue to find ways to improve communication and culture.
Revise the planning process to move away from schedule based management to work queue based management.
Additional Feedback (Optional): Please share any additional feedback that may be helpful for your manager to review as a part of your self-review assessment.

You won't be managing me for much longer, but as a head of engineering, I would love to see you drive an initiative towards a very strong and effective engineering culture.


No bloat, effective working, customer focussed, bias for excellence.


From my future manager, I would like to have a great partner in working out priorities, pitching them within the organization and company, and helping the team work as effectively as possible.

We will be getting a new manager. My main concern would be around a bad manager, so to be honest what I expect the most from Erika is to effectively manage the new manager from that perspective and to be on the look out for feedback. However, I am confident in our team to help provide feedback and fully trust in Erika doing the right thing with any feedback, good or bad.

As Erika and I have discussed, I would love to continue broaden my (and the search platform team's) impact within engineering. For example, I think our expertise can be really valuable in shaping and delivering some key Cody initiatives. I would appreciate Erika's insights in figuring out how to organize this, as it can be a challenge to really do well.


I also think it will be important for Erika to mentor our newly-hired Platform EM so there's good continuity for the team. The Platform team has had a bunch of manager changes, and I feel we would really benefit from a smooth transition.

This question is not entirely applicable, since a new manager for the entire platform begins in March. As such, Erika will no longer be my direct manager. However, I hope that we can continue to have intermittent skip-level meetings as I greatly value her level-headedness, insight, and perspective.

Given that Erika won't be my EM for much longer :-( I write this part of the review from the perspective of her as Head of Engineering and how she could support me in my role as IC.


Currently Cody and Code Search are two silos with very little interaction. For example, Search-Platform only learned just before the release that Cody will use Code Search as context source. Specifically, Cody uses an experimental pattern type that we hadn't work on for the past 6 months. I am glad it seems to have worked out, but we need better planning and communication ahead of time.


Along similar lines, it's crucial that we quickly establish a common understanding of what "better together" means. As the exact interpretation is still evolving, it presents an opportunity for an open dialogue within engineering where ideas can be examined and refined. I believe Erika would be an excellent moderator for this conversation, guiding us quickly towards a constructive outcome.


Lastly, based on my experience with disabling structural search, I think Sourcegraph needs a better product lifecycle management. From EAP, Beta, to production and deprecation, we need to have a clear process of how a product/feature progresses through these stages, with increasing barriers between the stages.

I guess this will technically apply to Matthew since Erika will no longer be my manager by the time this is being processed? I'm a little confused as to what to write here, so I'll write two answers, one for Erika and for Matthew.


For Erika:

Continue encouraging people across Engineering to push the quality bar
Identify factors contributing to people leaving around the 2-3 year tenure mark, and hopefully address that so that we don't have more attrition of key experienced people.
Generally, it would be valuable to have stability in terms of team structures within the Product Platform area.

For Matthew:

Work with Product team, Exec team etc. to make sure the things that our team is working on are aligned with the rest of the company.
Gain a thorough understanding of the various product areas owned by our team.
Provide regular feedback with monthly check-ins.

I would like to keep the good communication and have clarity on how I can keep delivering good value and impact for the business, what is Erika's perspective of me continuing growing here at Sourcegraph.


Apart from that, I also would like to keep receiving the support to keep advocating for a good security mindset for all the employees.

I'm not sure how relevant this would be since we're getting a new manager in March, but I think good visibility on how the work we're doing contributes to the needs and direction of the business could go a long way (i.e. we're doing X because this is a bottleneck in customer acquisition, or we're doing Y so we can pursue these deals, etc.).

Erika possesses tremendous engineering skills – and the soft skills that truly make a difference.  She brings all of that to Sourcegraph’s culture and we are the better for it.  She points out stellar contributions and highlights areas for potential improvement.  She has helped me to develop as an engineer and as an employee; altogether, to add value, and I’m thankful.  

Past 6-months: Looking back over the past review period, how would you rate this teammate’s performance against the expectations of their role, level and our values. In 2-3 sentences, please provide justification for selected performance rating. Additionally, Where did they excel? Where do they need improvement?

You stepping up to be Head of Eng has been one of the best and most valuable things over the last year. Thank you! You are doing an awesome job. You've gone a long way to increase the performance of our team, rebuild trust, and ensure that our engineering team is working on company priorities.


From your teammates:

despite her myriad responsibilities, Erika was able to still effectively lead: • Assisted the Source team’s planning process in a way that ensured all plans and stakeholders were aligned before the actual planning presentation. • Gave me relevant advice / tips for making the best possible case for my IC4 promotion ◦ making sure to get the gRPC tutorial out and announce it in various public forums ◦ asking me to highlight any cross-team collaboration aspects that came up while working with gRPC (which jogged my memory to get Andre from the security team to write a review for me).
Erika possesses tremendous engineering skills – and the soft skills that truly make a difference. She brings all of that to Sourcegraph’s culture and we are the better for it. She points out stellar contributions and highlights areas for potential improvement. She has helped me to develop as an engineer and as an employee; altogether, to add value, and I’m thankful.
In my last review I mentioned Erika was the best manager I had and I was waiting for the day I would lose her since she would become new head/vp/director/etc of something. That happened! She is still my manager though, and she manages to successfully provide context and direction to us. Additionally she is really good at working out tricky problems happening across the company. I don't know what else to add, but yeah she is an amazing person to have at our company and I am stoked she is our head of engineering.
Erika wore many hats while managing me for the past quarter. Head of engineering, manager of multiple teams, exec team member. Still, Erika is close to the matter. She knows what we're up to without us providing her extensive lists of work every other day. Erika can very well represent the team in PFP sessions (so likely in any other meeting as well) with very little briefing required. It's amazing given how scattered her focus is how she can be so technical, and understands problems quickly. Erika constantly challenges me and the team with just the right questions. Why is this a priority, what can we do instead, here's a thing that might be interesting for you to contribute to. I'm going to keep this review short as the period in which she managed me was relatively short and a new manager is about to start, but Erika is a great manager, an even better Head of Engineering, and I'm excited to see what's coming from her as our new sole HoE.
I am amazed by how Erika can wear so many different hats at Sourcegraph and still be impactful as EM. Here are a couple of examples where Erika directly enabled my success over the past 6 months. Example 1: Structural Search My RFC to disable structural search by default had not gained any traction. I tagged the reviewers and reminded them a couple of days later but not much happened. During our 1:1, I mentioned this to Erika and within 24 hours the conversation started, people read the RFC or delegated to others and things progressed nicely. She kept checking in to see how the conversation progressed. Example 2: Search Jobs We launched Search Jobs as EAP. Before the launch the project team recorded 2 intro videos, both of which were shown at company meetings a couple of weeks apart. We had posts in the #progress channel and announcements in the working group channel, but, as admin, I could see that nobody at Sourcegraph, except for the project team, had created a search job on S2 and it was just a couple of days before the launch. Again, I mentioned this to Erika in a skip-level meeting (at this point Thorsten was my EM) and suddenly people started creating search jobs and reporting bugs. Great job! Example 3: Keyword Search Erika encouraged Search-Platform to be bold and do the changes we think are best even if that means we have breaking changes in the query language. She has a strategic eye for the long term success. Her trust in our vision was very empowering to get the release to where it is right now. In general, Erika is an exceptional communicator; her questions are always sharp and her comments insightful. I enjoy working with her very much.
During the last cycle, Erika has provided me with invaluable support and guidance. She has been a trusted advisor, offering insightful advice on critical business decisions, such as terminating our Chainguard contract, continuing the support of features that help security in the long term like the gRPC initiative and navigating product vulnerabilities that require intervention from other teams. These challenges often involved balancing the urgency of security measures with the prioritization of feature launches and other interests. In addition to her strategic guidance, Erika has also supported me in managing my team, focusing not only on performance but also on sustainability. Her assistance has been crucial in addressing both immediate and long-term challenges, ensuring our team's continued success and resilience.
• Erika started the discussion on clarifying areas of ownership which sparked a good conversation between me and Erik on some shared areas. • Erika provided guidance on various aspects of the tech lead role, such as PFP and collaborating with other teams like Code Search. • Erika provided specific suggestions on having difficult conversations with different engineers when I was having friction working with them.
Erika had a massive amount on her plate the past 6 months but still managed to have regular check-ins where she provided valuable feedback with regards to personal development and team direction. I think she excelled at keeping track of our check-in discussions and consolidating the discussions she has with all the different engineers, proposing ways in which I can make more of an impact, or making me aware of the things I'm doing well and don't have to worry about. I honestly don't know where she could need improvement
To clarify: my rating and comments are for Erika as my direct manager, and not evaluating her performance as a Head of Engineering. Although Erika had a lot of responsibilities as co-head of engineering, she was a very effective and supportive direct manager. Some specific highlights: • When I seek specific advice like like "I'm struggling to figure out how to delegate this well", Erika never fails to give great, actionable suggestions. Often this comes with an insightful model of how she thinks about things, which ends up improving my knowledge and leadership skills. • She strikes a great balance of giving guidance and empowering her reports to lead. I feel that Erika really trusts my expertise and project leadership -- for example she was very supportive of our scoping for the keyword search project, and my proposal for what to focus on next quarter. At the same time, she asks on-point questions that help us realize some aspects we may have missed in our thinking. Overall, Erika helps "make complex things simple" and "keep simple things simple". She gives the team clear mental models of our priorities and strategy and makes timely decisions to bring clarity. This allows her reports focus on great execution, instead of wasting time being confused or overwhelmed. This is really hard to do in a fast-moving, technically deep AND broad engineering organization like Sourcegraph's.
Erika not only is an excessively competent director, but she also up-levels my own management abilities and contributes to my professional development both by example and advice. She consistently knows how to balance relying on me to use my own initiative with checking on progress to ensure that I am on track and remind me of the things I forgot. She reliably has good advice for me. Erika is constantly and consistently working with all teams, at pretty much every level. She's active in policy discussions, RFCs, Product, some Design, and People-oriented conversations. This may sound like she's getting too detailed, or stretching herself thin, but what I've seen is that she is able to keep tabs on things without getting swamped, and is able to be present when her input is needed. Some highlights from the past six months: • Guided the Search Suite team to stability after the re-orgs. • Participated in (organized and was essential in, really) long-term Product planning for Search Suite. • Took on directing the whole engineering org after being responsible for a third of it.
Erika is an experienced, focused manager. The team structure and company was undergoing heavy changes during the period that Erika was my manager. Despite overall pleasant experience of Erika as a manager, I was under the impression that the concerns about company direction I raised with her never really went anywhere, which left me frustrated at times. I believe the fact that Erika was put in a situation where she had to manage several teams on top of HoE duties had negative impact in a lot of areas.

Keep working with Carly to ensure you’re on top of any performance issues so she can help you navigate quickly.
 


From your teammates:

The top things that come to mind for me, GTM, and our customers: • Engineering needs to focus on product stability and quality. As I've mentioned a couple times, we should be committing to less to deliver with higher confidence. ◦ I've run into situations where EPD makes decisions and informs GTM after the fact. With Erika now the sole HoE, I want to ensure that I, as the GTM liaison, am in the loop and part of the decision-making process. Erika is a great partner so I'm confident we can make this happen, just noting that we need to do this. ◦ Another dimension of this I'd like to see more top of mind for engineering is thinking about admin, debugging, and troubleshooting within the product. The overall product experience needs to easier to self-service which will be critical to scaling our teams effectively. This feels very much like an afterthought that never gets much attention or prioritization and I'd like to see a higher bar here. • Engineering needs to lean in more on documentation and enablement. We talk a lot about Engineering getting pulled into customer problems and to get out of this cycle means we need to better document our product and help our teams be enabled and I'm here to partner with Erika directly on this. ◦ Part of this I'd like to see us uplevel our expectations around Eng dogfooding / testing expectations. Take the IDE conversation for example, we discussed as an e-team that most of our devs use Neovim so we should build Cody for Neovim but if they are doing work on an IDE they need to be deeply testing it first, too.
Eng continued to shift quite a bit in H2, particularly for Erika personally with assuming the HoE role. I do believe that Erika is the right leader for Engineering going forward for a multitude of reasons: extremely action-oriented & decisive; poised with a high-EQ demeanor that's frankly good for Engineering given their instability; data-driven, thoughtful approach. I believe we have a lot of work to do to get EPD overall, but certainly within Engineering as well to a better place and think Erika is the leader that can make this happen. Leaders are ultimately accountable for the outcomes of their teams -- so the bugs, instability, changing scope, etc do ultimately fall under her leadership. That said, I recognize the atypical Engineering organization structure we've had in place.
You won't be managing me for much longer, but as a head of engineering, I would love to see you drive an initiative towards a very strong and effective engineering culture. No bloat, effective working, customer focussed, bias for excellence.

The Platform team has had a bunch of manager changes, and I feel we would really benefit from a smooth transition.
Erika allowed me to operate independently, organize the Infrastructure team, and deliver various critical deliverables to our teams and customers. I really appreciate Erika's trust in my abilities to lead the organization effectively. Erika is doing a good job attempting to organize the Engineering organization. Teams see "Cody" and "Search" as separate worlds. I believe there are "pockets" of Engineering, and they do not talk or share as much as they could. Bringing those teams together and operating as a single unit would greatly benefit Sourcegraph. I would encourage Erika to benefit from Active Listening, keep an open mind, and update her views when presented with new evidence. I noticed that once Erika makes up her mind, there's no room for dialog anymore, especially if she has only partial context closing to new information and (potentially) updating her position.

If you're not already doing this, then I'd recommend trying to use Cody (and Code Search) at least once a day. Maybe have a pet project. Staying super close to the product will help you keep everything grounded. But in the HoE role, as I'm sure you've noticed, it's very easy to not have enough time for daily hands-on product usage. So I suspect it will require an intentional effort to make time for it.

Now revise the action plan to turn the goals into a series of 2-4 week focus areas. Each focus area should consist of a high level goal, the motivation behind it, and 2-3 reflection questions or activities that would result in material improvement. Ideally, these should be sequenced so that subsequent focus areas are providing cumulative impact rather than jumping around randomly
