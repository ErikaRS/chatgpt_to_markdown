This essay discourses on shared fate. Define shared fate
When things get tough, what makes the difference between those things we‚Äôre willing to give up on and those things we cling to, even when it might not be for the best for us personally? There are many reasons: habit, tradition, values, but a key factor in group scenarios tends to be shared fate.



Shared fate is foundational for aligned communities. It ensures that everybody has an equal amount of skin in the game and, from a game theoretic perspective, makes defection expensive.

For any community to be aligned for the long term there must be an indisputable sense of shared fate and a mechanism for achieving ‚Äòcommon knowledge‚Äô (in the specific logical sense of the phrase) of this shared fate.
 
With a positive valence this mechanism looks like finding a shared common higher purpose with others by explicitly going through the stages of the Tuckman model of group development.
With a negative valence this mechanism looks like hazing or a founding atrocity.

A shared fate helps to cut through many behaviors that can sabotage a group for the gain of an individual. When the value of a given action (leaking corporate strategy, sabotaging a coworker, selling weapons plans to an enemy state) is greater for an individual than their attachment to the group, it is highly likely that some individuals will take that path.

So to avoid this scenario, the benefits of putting the group first must be quite great or the consequences of negative actions are too awful for most individuals to stray from the group. Many early startups have this sense of ‚Äúus against the world‚Äù which tends to wear off as companies become larger, more successful, and more ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù.

Cultivating and maintaining a strong sense of shared fate for a group requires effort and energy. It also requires faith that others share your dedication to it. It‚Äôs a bad sign if you find yourself looking at your peer group and asking ‚Äùwho is still putting in that effort?‚Äù Thus communities that thrive in the long term need rituals for renewing that sense of common knowledge of a shared fate.

Shared fate refers to the concept that individuals within a group share a common destiny or outcome, linking their successes, failures, challenges, and rewards closely together. This sense of interconnectedness fosters a deep level of mutual commitment and accountability among group members, as their individual actions can significantly impact the entire group. It's a powerful force in forming and sustaining aligned communities, ensuring that every member has an equitable stake and making it costly for any member to act against the group's collective interests.

The difference between what we are willing to abandon and what we hold onto, even to our detriment, often boils down to factors such as habit, tradition, and values. However, in group settings, shared fate emerges as a critical determinant. It's this shared journey‚Äîencompassing both the potential for collective triumph and the risk of mutual downfall‚Äîthat binds individuals together more tightly than individual interests might.

Shared fate is essential for long-term alignment within communities. It necessitates a universally recognized and emotionally invested understanding of this collective journey, alongside mechanisms that reinforce this awareness. These mechanisms can take various forms, ranging from positive engagement, like finding a shared, higher purpose through stages of group development (e.g., the Tuckman model), to negative experiences such as hazing or experiencing a traumatic collective event.

This shared destiny is a deterrent against actions that might benefit the individual at the expense of the group. For example, in situations where individual gains from actions like leaking sensitive information or sabotage might outweigh their loyalty to the group, the sense of shared fate helps to align individual choices with the group's welfare. This alignment is particularly critical in early stages of organizational life, such as startups, where an "us against the world" mentality is prevalent. However, maintaining this sense of shared fate becomes more challenging as organizations grow and evolve, requiring conscious efforts to cultivate and renew this collective commitment.

Effective long-term communities invest in rituals and practices that refresh and reinforce their shared sense of destiny. This ongoing effort ensures that the community remains tightly knit, with each member actively contributing to and believing in the collective path forward. It‚Äôs a delicate balance, requiring faith in the group's collective commitment and vigilance to ensure that everyone continues to contribute to this shared journey.

When things get tough, what makes the difference between those things you‚Äôre willing to give up on and those things you cling to, even when it might not be for the best for you personally? There are many reasons: habit, tradition, values, but a key factor in group scenarios tends to be shared fate.

Shared fate is the idea that individuals within a group share a common destiny or outcome. Their successes, failures, challenges, and rewards are linked. Shared fate is foundational for aligning communities. It ensures that everybody has a meaningful amount of skin in the game and, from a game theoretic perspective, makes defection expensive.

For any community to be aligned for the long term there must be an indisputable sense of shared fate and a mechanism for achieving common knowledge of this shared fate. The sense motivates people to contribute to the common goals. The common knowledge lets them know how to work toward those common goals. The prisoner‚Äôs dilemma is a well known example of when agents have shared fate without shared knowledge. 
 
With a positive valence, shared fate looks like finding a shared higher purpose with others. Teams often achieve this sense of shared fate as they advance through the stages of the Tuckman model of group development. Families achieve it through their mutual concern for the well being of their members. Societies can achieve this through shared values which have visible, consequential impact on outcomes. With a negative valence this mechanism looks like hazing or a founding atrocity, instances where the sense that we did or experienced something terrible together leads to a sense of loyalty, albeit a sense of loyalty often based in fear of repercussions. 

A shared fate helps to cut through behaviors that can sabotage a group for the gain of an individual, such as in a tragedy of the commons. When the value of a given action (leaking corporate strategy, sabotaging a coworker, selling weapons plans to an enemy state) is greater for an individual than their attachment to the group, it is highly likely that some individuals will take that path.

To avoid this defection, the positive benefits of putting the group first must be quite great or the negative consequences too awful for most individuals to stray from the group. These benefits and consequences may be material, but just as often they are emotional, especially when they relate to our sense of identity. Many early startups have a sense of ‚Äúus against the world‚Äù which tends to wear off as companies become larger, more successful, and more ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù. 

Cultivating and maintaining a strong sense of shared fate for a group requires effort and energy. It also requires faith that others share your dedication to it.

What are classical allusions to the bonds of fate

### Assistant - 2024-03-06 18:00:35

Classical literature and mythology are rich with allusions to the bonds of fate, where destinies are intertwined by forces beyond individual control, emphasizing themes of inevitability, unity, and the collective journey of characters. Here are a few notable examples:

1. **The Three Fates (Moirai) in Greek Mythology**: Clotho (the spinner), Lachesis (the allotter), and Atropos (the unturnable) controlled the life and destiny of every mortal and god. Their unbreakable bond and shared duty in determining the fates of all beings is a profound classical allusion to the power and inevitability of fate.

2. **The Aeneid by Virgil**: Aeneas's journey, guided by fate to establish Rome, underscores the theme of destiny as a shared, communal bond that unites people through time and space. Aeneas's adherence to his fated path, despite personal loss and hardship, highlights the collective destiny of the Roman people.

3. **The Iliad by Homer**: The interconnected fates of Achilles and Hector, along with other warriors, reflect how individual destinies are woven into the larger tapestry of communal history and divine will, emphasizing the bond between personal valor and collective fate.

4. **Oedipus Rex by Sophocles**: The tragic story of Oedipus, whose attempt to escape his fate ironically leads him directly into its fulfillment, explores the inescapable bonds of fate that connect individuals to their family and community in profound and often devastating ways.

5. **The Odyssey by Homer**: Odysseus's long journey home is guided by fate, with the bonds between him, his family, and his crew being tested and strengthened through their shared struggles. The gods' involvement in the lives of mortals further illustrates the complex interplay between personal agency and the overarching power of fate.

These classical allusions not only explore the concept of fate as an immutable force but also delve into how these bonds of fate connect individuals to each other and to the larger narratives of their cultures and societies. They highlight the tension between free will and destiny, and the profound impact of shared fate on personal identity, communal bonds, and the course of history.
