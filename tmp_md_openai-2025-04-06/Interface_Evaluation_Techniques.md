In some application interfaces, it can be hard to determine whether or not a change improves user outcomes. For example, in a mapping application, a user pulling out the application, looking at the map, and closing the application can be a good thing: they were able to use the map to quickly orient. Or it could be a bad interaction: they didn't see information they wanted. A similar dichotomy applies to long interactions: a user might be enjoying exploring in depth or they might be having trouble finding what they want.

Similarly, generative interfaces output results but it's hard to tell whether or not the user thought the answer was good. The user might follow up because they want to go deeper or they might follow up because the first answer was bunk. They might stop asking anything more because their question was well answered or because the answer was so far off they gave up.

Explicit feedback such as üëç/üëé can be valuable in these cases. However, such feedback tends to be rare, even when there's an ambient UI for providing it.

What are techniques that teams can use to evaluate the success of interfaces that don't have a clear conversion metric?

There are several techniques that teams can use to evaluate the success of interfaces that don't have a clear conversion metric:

1. **Usability Testing**: This involves observing users as they interact with the product in real-time, allowing teams to understand where the points of friction are. This can involve think-aloud protocols, where users verbalize their thoughts as they navigate the interface.

2. **A/B Testing**: This approach involves creating two or more variants of an interface and testing them with different subsets of users. You can then analyze the results to determine which version leads to better user outcomes.

3. **Heatmap Analysis**: This tool shows where users are clicking or hovering their cursor on a page, providing insight into what information is attracting the most attention.

4. **User Surveys and Interviews**: Directly asking users about their experience can provide a wealth of information. Surveys and interviews can help you understand what users liked and disliked about the interface and any problems they encountered.

5. **Session Recordings**: By recording users' sessions, you can observe their interactions in detail, helping to uncover any points of confusion or difficulty.

6. **Customer Support Interactions**: Analyzing customer support tickets and chat logs can provide insights into the issues that users are experiencing and the questions they are asking, which can be used to improve the interface.

7. **Cohort Analysis**: This involves grouping users based on common characteristics or behaviors and then analyzing these groups to uncover patterns and trends that can guide interface improvements.

8. **Engagement Metrics**: While not direct measures of conversion, engagement metrics such as session length, page views, bounce rate, etc., can provide valuable insights into user behavior.

9. **Predictive Analysis**: Using AI and machine learning, predictive analysis can help you understand future user behavior based on past data. This can help guide decisions on interface improvements.

10. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: This is a measure of how likely users are to recommend your product to others. A high NPS indicates a generally positive user experience.

Remember, it's essential to consider both quantitative and qualitative data when evaluating interfaces. While quantitative data can provide a broad overview, qualitative data can provide the rich detail necessary to understand why users behave as they do. Combining these approaches can offer a more holistic view of the user experience.
