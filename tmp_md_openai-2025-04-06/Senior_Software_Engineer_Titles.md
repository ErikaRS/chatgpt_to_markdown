In software engineering, "senior" is actually more of a mid-career level these days. What's a different word for senior that actually implies not-mid-careeer.

In software engineering, and in many other fields, the term "senior" often implies a level of experience and expertise that is above entry-level or "junior" positions, but as you've noted, it has come to be seen more as a mid-career designation in many cases. For roles that require more experience and expertise than what "senior" implies, here are some alternative titles that suggest a higher level of seniority:

1. **Principal Software Engineer**: This title implies a higher rank than "Senior Software Engineer" and often involves leading complex projects and making high-level design decisions.

2. **Lead Software Engineer**: A "Lead" is often someone who has significant experience and not only contributes at a high level technically but may also lead a team of engineers.

3. **Staff Software Engineer**: In some companies, this title is used for individuals who have a high level of technical expertise that impacts the company at a strategic level.

4. **Architect / Software Architect**: This role involves designing the overall structure of systems and solutions, typically requiring extensive experience and deep technical knowledge.

5. **Engineering Manager**: This title indicates someone who has moved into a management role, often after a career progression through the technical ranks.

6. **Director of Engineering**: A director has a broader scope of responsibility than an individual contributor or team lead and is typically involved in long-term strategic planning.

7. **Technical Director**: Similar to "Director of Engineering," but with a title that emphasizes the technical expertise required for the role.

8. **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**: In a corporate hierarchy, a CTO is responsible for the technical direction of an organization and is considered a high-level executive.

9. **Fellow**: This is a distinguished title that is often reserved for the most senior technical staff. It implies not only seniority but also a substantial contribution to the field or company.

10. **Distinguished Engineer**: Like "Fellow," this title is given to individuals who have made significant contributions and are recognized as leaders in their technical domain.

11. **Vice President of Engineering**: This executive role is responsible for an organization's entire engineering department and reports directly to the CTO or CEO.

These titles can vary widely from one organization to another, both in terms of the experience required and the responsibilities entailed. It's also worth noting that in some organizations, especially those that embrace flat hierarchies or more fluid job roles, titles may not correspond directly to one's level of experience or seniority. In such cases, the individual's specific achievements, contributions, and reputation often speak louder than their official job title.

I was thinking more like "late" or "experienced". Can you give suggestions more along those lines than of existing industry titles?

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 12:39:55

Certainly, if you're looking for adjectives or terms that emphasize a level of seniority beyond "mid-career" without using traditional job titles, you might consider the following descriptors:

1. **Veteran**: Suggests a great deal of experience and time within the industry or field.
2. **Expert**: Implies mastery and comprehensive knowledge in a particular area.
3. **Seasoned**: Conveys a wealth of experience and a history of weathering many professional 'seasons' or cycles.
4. **Master**: Indicates a high degree of skill and expertise.
5. **Advanced**: Suggests a level beyond the standard "senior" proficiency.
6. **Accomplished**: Highlights a career filled with notable achievements and recognitions.
7. **Esteemed**: Carries connotations of respect earned through a long and distinguished career.
8. **Distinguished**: Recognized as authoritative and commanding great respect.
9. **Sage**: Often used for someone who has gained wisdom through long experience.
10. **Proficient**: Implies a high level of competence and comfort with complex tasks, often gained over a long career.
11. **Highly Experienced**: A straightforward description of an individual with extensive experience.
12. **Tenured**: Suggests someone who has long-standing experience, particularly in an academic or similar setting, but can also apply to industry veterans.
13. **Prolific**: Often used to describe someone who has produced a large body of work over their career.

When creating a job description or position title that reflects a level of seniority beyond mid-career, these words can be combined with the role in question. For example, instead of "Senior Software Engineer," one might use "Veteran Software Engineer," "Expert Software Developer," or "Seasoned Systems Architect." These terms emphasize a depth of experience and a breadth of knowledge that surpasses the usual connotations of "senior."

We rewrote a 5 level engineering ladder to simplify the level descriptions. We got feedback that it was still too many levels. Suggest ways to make my response to that feedback more concise and clear:

- Re: Rethinking the leveling system completely vs redoing the description:
  - If the desire here was to rethink the leveling system completely, we should have got that feedback ~2 months ago when we started this exercise. What changed between then and now and how could we have learned that sooner?
  - Rethinking the leveling system completely is going to land completely differently with ICs than redoing the descriptions of the current leveling system. Essentially, we're moving from redoing the descriptions to putting people into a situation where they feel like they're being promoted/demoted. 
  - It's also a lot more work. If we're combining levels, we'll need to figure out the impact on everything around compensation, both for the releveling itself as well as for how this impacts salary bands, increases, equity, etc. That isn't to say we shouldn't do the work, but, to echo the previous point, it's a very different exercise. 
  - Right now, we have a common set of levels with common meanings across the org. Releveling eng would break this. That may be fine, but it's additional work that would need to be done to reconcile it. (Or perhaps we would reconsider levels for everyone.)
  - Of secondary importance, but I don't want to ignore it completely, even if we ignore the ~1 month where we paused this so folks could focus on planning, we did spend about a month writing this and getting feedback that was wasted if it wasn't the right exercise in the first place. 
  - All that said: If we were to reduce number of levels, I think the idea @sqs raised in the doc of moving to 3 levels is preferable to combining L1/L2 which I don't think solves any problems. (See below).
  - If we were to move to 3 levels, I would propose: 
    - L1+L2 = Entry 
    - L3 + L4 = Mid
    - L5 = Expert
- Re: Combining L1/L2: 
  - We should separate out the decision of who we would hire right now from what our leveling system is. We agreed last calibration that hiring L1s was not something that is right for us right now. But that doesn't mean we should get rid of the level. 
  - If we combine L1/L2, note that this interacts with the guidance from finance that the default level for new positions is IC2 going forward. 
  - I don't think L1 vs L2 is actually the part of the ladder that's causing anyone any stress, so getting rid of it might remove some words from the table, but I don't see what problems it will solve.

Hereâ€™s a more concise and clear response to the feedback about simplifying the engineering ladder:

---

**Response to Leveling System Revision Feedback**

1. **Timing of Feedback**: Initially, our aim was to refine level descriptions. If a fundamental change to the leveling system was required, this should have been identified at the start of the process. Understanding what prompted this recent shift in perspective would be beneficial for future initiatives.

2. **Implications of Overhauling Levels**: Redesigning the leveling framework from scratch can create perceptions of promotion or demotion, affecting morale and clarity of career progression.

3. **Workload Concerns**: Combining levels requires an extensive review of compensation, equity, and salary bands, which is a substantial undertaking distinct from updating descriptions.

4. **Consistency Across the Organization**: Adjusting engineering levels may misalign with the rest of the organization, necessitating further reconciliation or a broader reevaluation of levels company-wide.

5. **Past Efforts**: The effort invested in the recent descriptions update should be acknowledged. While this work might seem redundant in light of new suggestions, it was valuable for current understanding.

6. **Reducing Levels - A Proposal**:
    - If reducing levels is the consensus, the three-level approach could be considered:
      - **Entry Level**: Combines L1 and L2, targeting newcomers or less experienced engineers.
      - **Mid Level**: Merges L3 and L4, encompassing a broad range of developing and established competencies.
      - **Expert Level**: Retains L5 for top-tier expertise and leadership.

7. **Maintaining L1/L2 Distinction**: We decided not to hire at L1 currently, but it doesn't necessitate removing the level. It's important to distinguish early career stages independently of immediate hiring strategies.

In summary, while streamlining levels may seem attractive, it's essential to consider the broader impact on our people and processes. If we decide on restructuring, it should be a deliberate decision with clear benefits and a structured plan to manage the transition.
