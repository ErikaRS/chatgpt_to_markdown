This draft review is a little ranty. Make it more my normal thoughtful style without watering down the fact that I did not like the book and regret having finished it.

I should have DNF'ed this one. 

What I liked about this book was Agnes in the past timeline. She was a strong, compelling, well written character. I wanted to read more about her life.

What I didn't like: pretty much everything else. What really pushed the rating down for me on this one was the pretension of the writing. 

The author used third person present tense. This generally feels a bit pretentious unless the book is a fast paced adventure or thriller.  It feels even more pretentious when the novel is dual timeline (both are present tense?!?!) and the novel is set hundreds of years ago.

The author never names Shakespeare. Perhaps ironically, this attempt at not naming him to keep the focus on Agnes actually makes him so prominent. In a novel where everyone else gets a name, he stays this abstract, almost spiritual figure. It's tedious. Also, if an author is going to run with the premise that Hamnet's death directly inspired Hamlet the play, go all in on it. It seemed like the author wasn't willing to commit to more than a vague sense of sorrow connecting the two which is likely better aligned with the historical evidence... but much less compelling as a novel. 

Then there's the writing itself. The apple shed is deservedly infamous, but let's not forget the 12 page chapters on how plague ridden fleas make it to Stratford-upon-Avon. 

Even without the pretentious writing, this wouldn't have been a winner for me. The book was dual timeline which is something I personally don't like but get that other people do. I also was really disappointed in Agnes' character development. After setting up such a strong character, we see her become, essentially, the damsel in distress who has to be saved from her despair by her husband.

Here’s a more thoughtful and reflective version of your review that maintains your clear critique without veering into a rant:

---

I should have set this book aside unfinished, but I powered through—and regret doing so. While there were moments of promise, the overall experience left me frustrated and disappointed.

What stood out positively was Agnes in the past timeline. She’s a strong, compelling character, written with depth and complexity. Her story drew me in, and I often found myself wanting more of her perspective and her life. Unfortunately, almost everything else about the book detracted from this initial spark.

One of the most significant barriers for me was the style of writing, which felt overly pretentious. The choice to use third-person present tense—a challenging narrative mode at the best of times—seemed ill-suited here. Present tense can work in fast-paced thrillers or adventures, but in a dual-timeline historical novel, it felt contrived. The effect was compounded by the setting, which spans centuries and yet insists on narrating both timelines in the same tense. This choice didn’t immerse me in the story; instead, it drew attention to itself, creating a distance from the narrative.

Then there’s the author’s decision not to name Shakespeare, a choice I assume was intended to keep the focus on Agnes. Ironically, this approach made him loom even larger in the story. In a novel where nearly every other character has a name, this abstraction made Shakespeare feel more like a symbolic, almost deified figure than a human presence. This was tedious rather than enlightening, and it undermined the effort to center Agnes. Similarly, the premise tying Hamnet’s death to the creation of *Hamlet* felt half-baked. If the novel aims to explore this connection, it should do so fully. Instead, we’re left with a vague undercurrent of sorrow—a choice that may align better with historical evidence, but one that felt emotionally thin in the context of fiction.

The prose itself also strained my patience. The much-maligned "apple shed" scene deserves its notoriety, but it’s far from the only example. Entire chapters devoted to the journey of plague-ridden fleas felt indulgent and misplaced, adding little to the story beyond showcasing the author’s stylistic flourishes.

Even setting aside the writing style, other elements fell flat for me. Dual timelines are rarely a structure I enjoy, and this book didn’t change my mind. Perhaps most disappointing was Agnes’s character arc. After starting as such a strong and dynamic presence, her role becomes disappointingly passive. By the end, she is portrayed as a woman broken by grief, whose salvation hinges on her husband. This shift felt like a betrayal of her earlier vibrancy and autonomy.

Overall, while I can see why others might connect with this book, it wasn’t for me. A promising character like Agnes deserved a better story, and I can’t help but wish the novel had leaned more fully into the ideas it hinted at, rather than retreating into abstraction and overwrought prose.
