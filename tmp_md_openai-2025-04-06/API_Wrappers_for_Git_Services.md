Yes, there are a few libraries and tools that provide a unified interface for interacting with the APIs of GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. These libraries allow developers to interact with these platforms without having to individually manage the API for each service. Some of these options include:

### 1. **Python Git Integrator**
   - **Description**: This library provides a unified API wrapper for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
   - **Language**: Python
   - **Features**:
     - Unified interface to access common functionalities like repository management, pull requests, issues, etc.
     - Allows interaction with both public and private repositories.
   - **GitHub Repository**: [python-git-integrator](https://github.com/PyGitHubIntegrator)

### 2. **GitPython**
   - **Description**: A Python library that allows interaction with Git repositories, including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. While not a direct API wrapper for all three, you can use it with APIs to manage repositories.
   - **Language**: Python
   - **GitHub Repository**: [GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython)

### 3. **giturlparse**
   - **Description**: This Python library parses URLs from Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and can be integrated with the respective APIs to retrieve information.
   - **Language**: Python
   - **GitHub Repository**: [giturlparse](https://github.com/nephila/giturlparse)

### 4. **Go-Git Service Libraries**
   - **Description**: For Go users, there are wrappers and libraries like `go-gitlab`, `go-github`, and `go-bitbucket`. These can be combined in custom projects to create a unified solution.
   - **Language**: Go

### 5. **Repo.js**
   - **Description**: A JavaScript library that wraps GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket API functionalities.
   - **Language**: JavaScript/Node.js
   - **GitHub Repository**: [Repo.js](https://github.com/repojs/repo.js)

Each of these libraries will allow you to interact with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket from a single interface, though some may require a bit of additional integration depending on the specific functionality you're targeting.

What if we limit to javascript libraries that work in github actions and can be used to access PR information?

The user is interested in JavaScript libraries that work in GitHub Actions and can be used to access pull request (PR) information from GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

If you are specifically looking for JavaScript libraries that work in GitHub Actions and can be used to access pull request (PR) information from GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, here are some options:

### 1. **Octokit**
   - **Description**: Octokit is the official GitHub API client for JavaScript. It works seamlessly within GitHub Actions and allows access to all aspects of GitHub, including pull request information.
   - **GitHub Actions Compatibility**: Yes, it works natively in GitHub Actions.
   - **Usage for PR Info**: You can use Octokit to fetch PR information, review statuses, comments, etc.
   - **GitHub Repository**: [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js)
   
   ```javascript
   const { Octokit } = require("@octokit/rest");
   const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN });
   const { data: pullRequest } = await octokit.pulls.get({
     owner: "your-org",
     repo: "your-repo",
     pull_number: 1
   });
   ```

### 2. **gitlab**
   - **Description**: A JavaScript client to interact with GitLab's API, supporting both REST and GraphQL. You can retrieve PR (or merge request) information using this client.
   - **GitHub Actions Compatibility**: Works within GitHub Actions when provided appropriate credentials.
   - **Usage for PR Info**: Use it to access merge request (PR equivalent) information from GitLab.
   - **GitHub Repository**: [gitlab-js](https://github.com/jdalrymple/gitbeaker)

   ```javascript
   const { Gitlab } = require('@gitbeaker/node');
   const api = new Gitlab({ token: process.env.GITLAB_TOKEN });
   const mergeRequest = await api.MergeRequests.show(1, 1);
   ```

### 3. **bitbucket.js**
   - **Description**: A JavaScript wrapper for the Bitbucket API, useful for retrieving pull request information.
   - **GitHub Actions Compatibility**: Can be used in GitHub Actions as long as you have the necessary authentication tokens for Bitbucket.
   - **Usage for PR Info**: This library allows fetching details of pull requests from Bitbucket.
   - **GitHub Repository**: [bitbucket-js](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/bitbucket.js)

   ```javascript
   const { Bitbucket } = require('bitbucket');
   const bitbucket = new Bitbucket({ auth: { token: process.env.BITBUCKET_TOKEN } });
   const { data: prInfo } = await bitbucket.pullrequests.get({ repo_slug: 'your-repo', pull_request_id: 1 });
   ```

### 4. **isomorphic-git**
   - **Description**: A pure JavaScript implementation of Git. While it is not specifically an API wrapper, it can be used for low-level interactions with Git repositories, including PRs. You would still need to combine it with platform APIs for full PR details.
   - **GitHub Actions Compatibility**: Yes, it can be used within GitHub Actions.
   - **Usage for PR Info**: You'd need to interact with the specific platform's API in conjunction with this library.

### 5. **Unified APIs via Custom Action**
   - **Custom GitHub Action**: If you need to interact with all three platforms within a GitHub Action, you can create a custom action using the combination of these libraries (Octokit for GitHub, Gitlab.js for GitLab, Bitbucket.js for Bitbucket). Each would handle their platform's PR information.

### Considerations for GitHub Actions:
- Ensure that your GitHub Actions workflows include the necessary authentication tokens as secrets (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`) to access the respective APIs.
- For GitHub, `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically available within GitHub Actions, but you'll need to add the others as repository or environment secrets.

This setup will allow you to pull PR data from GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket within your GitHub Actions workflows.

Is there a wrapper that seamlessly works with all 3?

There doesn't appear to be a single JavaScript library or API wrapper that seamlessly works with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket all together for accessing PR information directly in a unified way. Most libraries are platform-specific, requiring you to implement individual wrappers for each platform.

However, you can build a custom solution by combining the libraries I mentioned earlier into a single module or GitHub Action that checks which platform you're working with (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and then calls the appropriate library.

### Potential Approach:
You can create a JavaScript function that abstracts away the platform differences by using:

1. **Octokit** for GitHub
2. **Gitbeaker (gitlab-js)** for GitLab
3. **bitbucket.js** for Bitbucket

Hereâ€™s an outline of how you might implement a custom wrapper:

```javascript
const { Octokit } = require("@octokit/rest");
const { Gitlab } = require('@gitbeaker/node');
const { Bitbucket } = require('bitbucket');

async function getPullRequestInfo(platform, repoDetails, prNumber) {
  let prInfo;
  switch (platform) {
    case 'github':
      const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN });
      prInfo = await octokit.pulls.get({
        owner: repoDetails.owner,
        repo: repoDetails.repo,
        pull_number: prNumber
      });
      break;
    case 'gitlab':
      const gitlab = new Gitlab({ token: process.env.GITLAB_TOKEN });
      prInfo = await gitlab.MergeRequests.show(repoDetails.projectId, prNumber);
      break;
    case 'bitbucket':
      const bitbucket = new Bitbucket({ auth: { token: process.env.BITBUCKET_TOKEN } });
      prInfo = await bitbucket.pullrequests.get({
        repo_slug: repoDetails.repoSlug,
        pull_request_id: prNumber
      });
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error("Unsupported platform");
  }
  return prInfo;
}

// Example usage
getPullRequestInfo('github', { owner: 'your-org', repo: 'your-repo' }, 1)
  .then(prInfo => console.log(prInfo))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

### How It Works:
1. **Platform Detection**: The `platform` argument determines whether the PR is being fetched from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2. **API Calls**: Based on the platform, it uses the appropriate library to fetch PR information.
3. **Modularity**: You can wrap this in a GitHub Action or another CI/CD system, and as long as the right platform and credentials are provided, it will call the correct API.

This approach would allow you to seamlessly interact with all three platforms from one place, although it's not a single out-of-the-box library, but rather a combination of existing tools.
