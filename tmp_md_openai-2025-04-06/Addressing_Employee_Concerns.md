Give feedback on this draft response. The goal is to validate the commenter's questions while letting them know what we are doing about it.

Employee sentiment survey comment: In the back of my head I still have layoffs and our performance reviews which were extremely harsh these past calibrations, which brings a lot of anxiety. I do see career development - but at the same time I'm thinking whether I'm next to be laid off. This greatly changes the perspective.

Draft response: I'm so sorry you're worried about layoffs. The last impact review cycle, especially its adjacency to the layoffs, did burn a lot of trust. It is the responsibility of all of the managers and, especially, Steve and me as the heads of engineering, to make sure we're rebuilding that trust. The monthly performance checkins are one tool for doing this, so that you know how you're doing on an ongoing basis so you don't have to worry about what will happen in impact reviews. That said, I know that trust was damaged, and we need to demonstrate this in practice, not just in theory.

Your draft response is empathetic and addresses the concerns raised by the employee. Here are a few suggestions to enhance it:

1. **Acknowledgment of Concerns**: You've done well in acknowledging the employee's anxiety about layoffs and harsh performance reviews. It's crucial to maintain this empathetic tone throughout the response.

2. **Concrete Actions**: You mentioned monthly performance check-ins as a tool to rebuild trust. Consider elaborating on this with more details or examples of how these check-ins will be different and more reassuring than past reviews.

3. **Future Commitments**: While you acknowledge the need to rebuild trust, it would be beneficial to mention specific actions or strategies that are being put in place to prevent a repeat of the past situation. This could include more transparent communication, changes in the review process, or support systems for employee concerns.

4. **Open Door Policy**: Encourage ongoing dialogue by inviting further feedback or questions. This could be through an open-door policy, regular town hall meetings, or anonymous feedback channels.

5. **Positive Reinforcement**: Briefly highlight some positive aspects or recent achievements within the team or organization. This can help in balancing the response and remind employees of the positive environment and opportunities available.

6. **Personal Touch**: Adding a personal note or a commitment from you and Steve as the heads of engineering, emphasizing your dedication to the team's well-being, can make the response feel more sincere and reassuring.

7. **Closing Remarks**: End with a positive and forward-looking statement that reinforces your commitment to the team and the improvement of the work environment.

Revised Response:
"I appreciate your honesty in sharing these concerns. The anxiety around layoffs and the impact of the recent review cycle is something we take seriously. As heads of engineering, Steve and I are committed to rebuilding trust within our team. We're implementing monthly performance check-ins as a step towards transparent and continuous communication, ensuring you have a clear understanding of your standing and progress. Additionally, we're exploring more supportive and fair review processes to foster a positive work environment. We understand that rebuilding trust requires consistent effort and time, and we are dedicated to demonstrating our commitment in practice, not just in theory. Please feel free to reach out to us directly with any further concerns or suggestions. Together, we'll work towards not only maintaining but enhancing our team's dynamic and success."

Here's another piece of feedback I need to respond to. My challenge is that the response expresses a legitimate frustration (our work has not yet showed concrete progress) but expressed in a rather sarcastic way. Help me draft a response which takes the concern seriously without encouraging the sarcasm. The substance of the response should be that we are working toward a general availability release but also that it's true that success won't come until we're getting usage and sales, not just improvements. 

The option being rated: Our company is making progress that will lead to future success.
The response: Strongly Disagree. We're "manifesting" progress, but have little to show so far.

Draft Response:

Thank you for sharing your thoughts candidly. It's clear from your response that you're looking for tangible signs of progress, and that's a fair expectation. While we are indeed working towards a general availability release, we understand that the true measure of our success will be reflected in actual usage and sales, not just in the milestones we've set internally.

We recognize that our journey towards these concrete results has been slower than anticipated, and this can be frustrating. It's important to acknowledge that while we've been laying the groundwork for future success, we haven't yet reached the point where this effort is visible in the form of tangible outcomes. We are actively addressing this by focusing our efforts more sharply on areas that directly contribute to usage and sales.

I want to assure you that every step we're taking, including the upcoming general availability release, is aimed at achieving this goal. We value your patience and ongoing contribution as we navigate this path. Your feedback is a reminder of the importance of not only celebrating our progress but also focusing on the practical results that matter most to our company's growth and success.

We are committed to keeping the team updated on our progress and milestones, and we encourage open and constructive feedback as we move forward. Let's continue this conversation in a way that fosters collaboration and shared understanding of our goals and challenges.

Now summarize that to 3-5 sentences.

Thank you for your honest feedback. We understand that while we're making strides towards a general availability release, the real success of our efforts will be judged by actual usage and sales, not just internal milestones. Acknowledging that our progress has been slower than expected, we are intensifying our focus on areas that directly impact usage and sales. Your input is invaluable, and we are committed to transparently sharing updates and encouraging open dialogue as we work towards tangible results that reflect our company's growth and success.

Evaluate this response: Thank you for the feedback. While we're making strides for a GA release for Cody and a 6.0 launch for Code Search, the real success of our efforts will be judged by actual usage and sales, not just implementing our work plans, and we haven't seen that yet. The next 3-6 months are going to be crucial in turning our nominal progress into real results. Please continue to give feedback, and if you have ideas where we can make better investments, please let me know!

### Assistant - 2023-12-12 16:29:38

The response is effective in several ways:

1. **Acknowledgement of Feedback**: The response begins by thanking the commenter for their feedback, which is a positive way to start and shows respect for their input.

2. **Clarity on Objectives**: It clearly states the company's goals (GA release for Cody and a 6.0 launch for Code Search), which helps in setting the context for the discussion.

3. **Recognition of True Success Metrics**: The response acknowledges that the real measure of success is not just in reaching milestones (like releases and launches) but in achieving tangible outcomes like usage and sales. This aligns well with the commenter's concerns about seeing concrete progress.

4. **Realistic Outlook**: By admitting that these results have not yet been seen, the response reflects honesty and a realistic understanding of the situation, which can build trust among employees.

5. **Future Focus**: Mentioning the next 3-6 months as a crucial period for turning progress into results gives a sense of direction and urgency, which can be motivating for the team.

6. **Encouragement of Participation**: The call for continued feedback and suggestions for better investments is a great way to involve employees in the process, fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration.

However, to further enhance the response:

- **Addressing Sarcasm**: The original feedback was sarcastic. While the response is professional, addressing the tone directly (e.g., “I understand your frustration might lead to sarcasm...”) might acknowledge the emotional aspect more explicitly.
  
- **Specific Actions**: While the response is good at outlining general intentions, adding specific actions or strategies being implemented to achieve these goals could provide more confidence in the plan.

Overall, the response is constructive, addresses the main concerns, and encourages ongoing communication, which are key elements in an effective response to feedback.
