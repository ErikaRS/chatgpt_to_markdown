I am rewarding people for doing extra work for urgent needs. I want to make sure the team understands that we really appreciate people who step up in those times. I do not want the team to think that performing unsustainable heroics is the way to get bonuses. 

Right now I'm using the phase "going above and beyond, to describe this with. But going "above and beyond" has a positive connotation. What's an alternate phrasing that has a more neutral connotation. It should still express appreciation but come across more as "thanks for the hard work" than "yay heroics!"

Instead of using "going above and beyond," you can consider phrases such as:

1. "Stepping up when needed"
2. "Exhibiting exceptional commitment"
3. "Showing extraordinary dedication"
4. "Extending efforts beyond routine tasks"
5. "Taking initiative under pressure"
6. "Demonstrating resilience and resolve"
7. "Supporting our urgent needs diligently"
8. "Adapting quickly to challenging circumstances"

Each of these phrases acknowledges the additional effort your team members put forth without necessarily glorifying the act of working under high stress or extreme conditions. It's also essential to balance these acknowledgements by promoting sustainable work practices and encouraging work-life balance to avoid inadvertently fostering a culture of overwork.
