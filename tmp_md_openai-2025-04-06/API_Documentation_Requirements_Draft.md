Here's a Loom of how I'm thinking about the structure and how I can edit contents of the OpenAPI spec https://www.loom.com/share/3c0cf4655dde436da848fd89d83dcea0

Here's the command I used to compile the OpenAPI spec and copy it into the docs repo
pnpm -C internal/openapi compile && cp internal/openapi/tsp-output/@typespec/openapi3/openapi.Sourcegraph.Latest.yaml ~/dev/sourcegraph/docs/public/openapi/openapi.Sourcegraph.Latest.yaml
4:11
We can probably add some kind of pnpm openapi:watch script

I opened a PR with some structural changes and a script to automatically watch the public.tsp source for changes https://github.com/sourcegraph/docs/pull/700
#700 Page layout for API docs
Based on the PR here #685 with some changes
• Name "Sourcegraph REST API"
• Path api/openapi
• Script pnpm openapi:watch
• Load OpenAPI spec from the repo
Pull Request approval
Although pull request approval is not enforced for this repository in order to reduce friction, merging without a review will generate a ticket for the docs team to review your changes. So if possible, have your pull request approved before merging.

Assuming you have cloned the sourcegraph repo next to the docs repo,run pnpm openapi:watch and it will autobuild the openapi spec

Hey 
@Olaf Geirsson
 thanks for helping me track this. Few questions about what's confusing me: :see_no_evil:
Right now, we have two separate sections under "CLI & API," namely, the Graphql API and the Stream API. Are we combining all of them with the OpenAPI explorer?
If yes, then this would mean that on the Information Architecture, there will be only one single entry, and that would be Sourcegraph API, which would house everything?
Again, if this is also true, this would mean we need to remove docs for Graphql and Stream API docs?


Olaf Geirsson
  Oct 9th at 7:31 PM
Good questions. I think it's worth reevaluating the information architecture. Here's how I see things:
We have two CLI tools: src (Code Search) and cody (Cody)
We have two shapes of APIs: GraphQL and REST, with no distinction between Code Search and Cody (both currently use a mix of both flavors of APIs)
7:32
The existing GraphQL docs should remain unchanged. I posted in another thread how we should update the GraphQL explorer and link it from the sidebar https://sourcegraph.com/docs/api/graphql/api-docs
sourcegraph.com
Sourcegraph docs
Documentation for Sourcegraph, the code intelligence platform. (298 kB)
https://sourcegraph.com/docs/api/graphql/api-docs

7:33
The "Stream API" page can stay unchanged but we should update the page title to "Streaming Search API". We have several kinds of streaming APIs (search, llm chat completions, git stuff, ..). All of these APIs will eventually be documented via OpenAI and fall under the "REST APIs" bucket.
7:34
I have used "REST" here, although they're technically just HTTP APIs with a mix of design patterns. Not sure how pedantic we want to be about it in our docs.


maedah.batool
  Oct 9th at 7:48 PM
The CLI docs are sorted, and I believe we have clarity on it. The only change I see is moving the Cody CLI docs with the src CLI docs (ref. to Quinn's comment the other day). Also, considering these new changes I can also do separate sections for both CLI and API. Like:
CLI
Sourcegraph CLI
Cody CLI
API
Graphql API (keep it in original format just make sure it's updated with the path https://sourcegraph.com/docs/api/graphql)
REST API (rename current path from cody-api to rest-api with the path https://sourcegraph.com/docs/api/rest-api. It will cover contents of Streaming Search API and all other endpoints too. )
WDYT? (edited) 


Olaf Geirsson
  Oct 9th at 7:53 PM
Sounds like a good plan!
7:54
I noticed that the Elements docs don’t render nicely on mobile. I tried a popular alternative Redocly and it’s much nicer https://sourcegraph.github.io/openapi/redocly/


Olaf Geirsson
  Oct 9th at 7:59 PM
I also handles correctly a critical type in our LLM API, a Message. I noticed Elements has a bug there.

Looks like we have a plan. Summarizing the list of tasks.
Action items for Maedah:
Restructure IA for the CLI and API docs
Rename file path from cody-api to rest-api
Remove Stream API docs from the main nav (considering the streaming search endpoint will live with the OpenAPI spec)
Cleanup on styles and code snippets and make the docs production-ready
Action items for Olaf:
Move all endpoints to the OpenAPI including the Streaming Search ones
Anything that I am missing?
8:03
I noticed that the Elements docs don’t render nicely on mobile. I tried a popular alternative Redocly and it’s much nicer https://sourcegraph.github.io/openapi/redocly/
Can we please keep using Elements docs? All the style mapping has been done based on them. Switching to a new alternative would mean redoing everything again. :thinkingalex:


Olaf Geirsson
  Oct 9th at 9:39 PM
One of the risks of switching systems down the road is that the current URL structure is determined by elements api/openapi#/operations/LLMService_chatCompletions
One option is to move this to a separate path api/openapi/elements#/operations/LLMService_chatCompletions so that we can introduce another system later while preserving links
9:41
I'm OK with launching initially with Elements even if it's unusable on mobile. If it's not a ton of effort to use redocly from the start, then I would prefer that. BTW, we may decide to delay launching the official docs based on what 
@aravind
 decides here from a Product perspective.
9:41
(we have a call tomorrow to discuss it)
9:42
I will also include an OpenAPI explorer with the Sourcegraph instance, and will evaluate using Redocly there instead of Elements. It's fine if we have separate systems to begin with as long as we can consolidate later.
9:42
Move all endpoints to the OpenAPI including the Streaming Search ones
I'll get this done ASAP

Is there any reason we don't want to do a simpler IA with singular pages and the Search, Cody sections on each page? So left nav looks like with sections in one page? Or is that too confusing? I suspect that we will have to combine them at some point or rebrand them based on One Box

I like the anthropic API docs https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages
In particular:
Clean URL: api/messages for "Messages API". We could do something similar as long as we can embed OpenAI components from mdx files for a given OpenAPI "operation".
Nice selector for union types (screenshot)
Curl/Python/JavaScript is the choice of languages

I agree with that structure. From a product POV, I'm going to say we cannot publish docs without examples, going to strongly insist that we spend enough time on that :slightly_smiling_face: It doesn't have to be comprehensive, but let's have a few things to help folks start using it faster!

@maedah.batool
 I'm increasingly on the fence about the four column layout here (screenshot). I think we should try to stick with three columns, where the "endpoints" are part of the sidebar, and we remove "schemas". This probably requires integrating more deeply with the React API of the OpenAPI docs tool.
I'm starting to wonder if we should drop "REST API" in favor of this hierarchy:
Sourcegraph GraphQL API
Existing hierarchy.. Should ideally include an updated explorer.
Sourcegraph Search API
Streaming Search
Raw API
Sourcegraph Cody API
Quickstart
Chat (does not exist yet)
Context
LLM

I briefly looked into using the lower level React APIs and Elements doesn't seem to support anything, and Redocly has a React component for Operation but I'm not sure how to create OperationModel. Will continue tomorrow.

There will be three columns see this preview that I am working on.


Olaf Geirsson
  Oct 9th at 11:36 PM
That's an improvement!
11:37
I'm going to sleep on this, but I'm still on the fence about publishing auto-generated docs like these in our official API docs. It doesn't look nice, when the rest of the website is so slick.
11:38
The custom styles really help though..
11:42
I can tweak the labels of the operations so it maybe work out good engineer for an initial launch. Will try tomorrow :muscle::skin-tone-2:

 Following up from conversations with 
@aravind
 
@Connor O'Brien
 
@Dan Adler
, we reached the decision to delay the launch of publicly available Cody API docs. I'm sorry for the back and forth on this. We realized it's strategically beneficial if we use the next 1-3 months to collect more early-access feedback from customers before launching the API more publicly.

Thank you for your help on this, and your draft PR was a good dry-run for us to realize how we want to market/brand/sell this product. The work is not wasted, we will eventually add API docs to the website.
I documented my key takeways from this exercise in a Linear doc

Thanks for closing the thread. Some details from the discussion for visibility and awareness:
There is an opportunity to leverage the early days of the APIs to collaborate closely with customers, get more feedback, and understand how they are using the APIs. If these are widely available, we risk being in the dark about how customers are using them (we are also adding some of the important telemetry pieces this release, and will likely need more)
Pricing and Packaging are still open questions for APIs. Given the inherent risk of overuse, which can be very expensive for us, we want to be mindful of who uses them.
Olaf's PR does provide an opportunity to share docs with any customers we choose to easily, so they can have the right info
This also allows us to collect feedback on the docs themselves as the content is the same
@maedah.batool
 I also think we need to spend time thinking through how we can best represent the docs, we have a few back-and-forths above, let's agree on a layout soon :slightly_smiling_face:
#1014 feat(cody): add embedded API docs via OpenAPI/Redocly
Fixes CODY-3946
Demo https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C078NDD0LSW/p1728562473630049
Previously, we hosted OpenAPI docs in this repository https://github.com/sourcegraph/openapi  
This was problematic because it was difficult to discover, I had to manually copy docs over there as we updated them, and it only included docs for the latest version
Now, we make Cody API docs available inside the Sourcegraph instance so that they're available to anyone who is logged into an Enterprise instance. Our plan for Cody API is to make it an Enterprise offering only to start with so these docs are not visible on dotcom for now.
The decision to use Redocly was influenced by several factors:

Hey folks thanks for the heads up. I'll close up the works on the docs today and save all the work for later use. However, one small request can we please continue using the Elements docs? If we switch to Redocly, this would mean all the work that was put in specifically regarding the custom styles would go to waste. And I will have to start all over again.


Olaf Geirsson
  Oct 11th at 7:30 PM
The information architecture will be the primary decision factor for what solution we eventually go for. We won’t make the decision until later so let’s reevaluate then.

@maedah.batool
 Can we look at this holistically across the entire new IA that you are considering for docs? We should align on the IA first, where we feel comfortable with the accessibility and discoverability of these docs (this stands true for any docs in general, but it's trickier with requiring examples and CLI vs API / Search vs Cody API). Once we agree on that, let's figure out the Elements vs Redocly. I suspect the actual style will be something we can iterate on regularly, but we don't have the same luxury with the IA (edited) 


maedah.batool
  Oct 11th at 9:23 PM
Sounds good, but do we have a new timeline for it to go live? I have more stuff planned for Nov-Dec.

  "content": "## API Documentation Requirements Draft\n\n### Background\nThis document serves as a first draft of the requirements for the API documentation update. It summarizes the discussions and conclusions from a Slack thread involving Olaf Geirsson, Maedah Batool, Aravind, and others from October 9-11, focusing on restructuring OpenAPI, GraphQL, and CLI documentation for Sourcegraph.\n\n### Key Points from Discussions\n\n1. **Current Structure and Changes**\n   - There are currently separate sections under \"CLI & API\" for the GraphQL API and the Stream API.\n   - The OpenAPI Explorer will be used to consolidate and enhance these sections.\n   - GraphQL documentation remains unchanged but needs linking updates.\n   - The Stream API will be renamed to \"Streaming Search API\" and integrated into the broader REST API documentation, which will use OpenAPI.\n\n2. **Information Architecture (IA) Restructure**\n   - The proposal is to create distinct sections for CLI and API within the IA.\n     - **CLI:** Includes \"Sourcegraph CLI\" and \"Cody CLI.\"\n     - **API:** Includes \"GraphQL API\" (updated path), and \"REST API\" (renamed from cody-api to rest-api). The REST API will cover all streaming endpoints.\n   - Olaf and Maedah agreed to keep using the current tool, Elements, for rendering, with the possibility of integrating Redocly if it improves user experience.\n\n3. **Page Layout and Mobile Usability**\n   - Olaf highlighted concerns about Elements not rendering well on mobile and suggested switching to Redocly.\n   - Maedah expressed concerns about the effort required to redo custom styles if switching to Redocly.\n   - For now, they agreed to launch with Elements and revisit the decision later.\n\n4. **API Documentation Objectives**\n   - The goal is to make the OpenAPI documentation clearer and more accessible, embedding components in mdx files where necessary.\n   - Examples are critical for usability\u2014both Aravind and Olaf emphasized the need for examples to help users get started.\n   - Early access feedback will be used to iterate on the API docs before a full public launch.\n\n5. **Decisions and Pending Actions**\n   - Delayed the public launch of Cody API docs until more early-access feedback is gathered.\n   - Moving endpoints to the OpenAPI spec, updating paths, and improving IA remains the focus.\n   - Elements vs. Redocly decision will be revisited based on IA alignment across the documentation.\n\n### Action Items Summary\n\n**For Maedah:**\n- Restructure IA for CLI and API docs.\n- Rename the file path from cody-api to rest-api.\n- Remove the Stream API from the main navigation (it will be integrated with OpenAPI).\n- Clean up styles and code snippets.\n\n**For Olaf:**\n- Move all endpoints, including Streaming Search, to the OpenAPI.\n- Explore options for maintaining a flexible URL structure that can accommodate a future change in documentation rendering tools.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Alignment on the Information Architecture (IA) to ensure consistency and usability.\n- Continued discussions on whether to stick with Elements or switch to Redocly for rendering API docs, considering ease of use and accessibility across devices.\n- Setting a revised timeline for the public launch of the API documentation."
