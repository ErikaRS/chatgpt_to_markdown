I am working on a career ladder for engineering. At its heard it shared expectations that cross all roles and levels. We got feedback that it is too focused on the new and shiny and doesn't clearly show that we value fixing and maintaining the old just as much as launching the new (when the business impact is clear). Please suggest some additions to the common expectations.

Current common expectations:
Our expectations for all engineers, regardless of level or role:

Impact
Your work directly contributes to achieving the company’s strategic goals.
Proficiency
You have high productivity and output, with frequent and meaningful commits. You are shipping regularly.
You write high-quality, well-tested, well-documented, maintainable code that aligns with the style and practices of the codebase.
You write high-quality documents and documentation in order to solicit and receive the best feedback on your proposals. 
Execution
You seek out work, rather than waiting for work to come your way.
You are diligent through the entire software lifecycle, through planning, coding, documenting, shipping, demoing, supporting, and improving your software over time.
You find simple, correct solutions, implement them quickly, and iterate as needed.
Teamwork
You escalate quickly and efficiently when you get blocked, stuck, overloaded, or see a better way to achieve our goals.
You do not gate-keep, but rather aim to accelerate and unblock your colleagues.
You communicate thoughtfully and proactively to keep stakeholders informed and identify risks.

To emphasize the value of maintaining and enhancing existing systems, consider the following additions to your common expectations:

1. **Sustainability**
    - You recognize the importance of maintaining and improving legacy systems, ensuring their longevity, security, and relevance.
    - You prioritize technical debt reduction, understanding that this is integral to the health and efficiency of our software systems.
    - You regularly review existing code and systems to identify areas for optimization and enhancement.

2. **Holistic Understanding**
    - You value the knowledge and understanding of our existing systems and take the time to understand how they function and interrelate.
    - You actively seek out opportunities to simplify and streamline our current systems, considering the broader implications of your changes.

3. **Continual Improvement**
    - You don't just chase the 'new and shiny'. You balance innovation with the need to refine and optimize what we already have.
    - You proactively identify areas where existing systems can be made more robust, user-friendly, or efficient.
    - You take pride in enhancing the resilience and performance of existing systems, understanding their importance to our business continuity.

4. **Knowledge Sharing & Legacy**
    - You document not only how systems work, but also why certain decisions were made, ensuring that future engineers understand the context.
    - You mentor and train your colleagues on both new and existing systems, ensuring a broad base of knowledge across the team.

5. **Customer-Centric**
    - You understand that our legacy systems often have a significant user base and are critical to our customer's daily operations.
    - You seek feedback from users of existing systems and use it to drive improvements, ensuring that we continue to meet and exceed their expectations.

6. **Pragmatism**
    - You balance the drive for innovation with the understanding that stability, reliability, and maintainability are often of equal or greater importance.
    - You advocate for refactoring and improving when it’s clear that it will provide tangible benefits in terms of performance, security, or user experience.

Remember, while it's essential to foster innovation and forward-thinking, it's equally crucial to ensure that existing systems are stable, efficient, and continually improving. This balance will ensure long-term success and sustainability for the company.

Can you restructure the suggestions so that they are additional items under the top level categories of "Impact", "Proficiency", "Execution", and "Teamwork" rather than new categories? 

### Assistant - 2023-10-10 16:21:21

Of course! Here's how the suggested additions can be restructured under the top-level categories:

Is there a single word which captures the ideas of both proficiency and scope?

### Assistant - 2023-10-10 16:30:13

A single word that might capture both the ideas of proficiency (skillfulness, expertise) and scope (range, breadth) is "Mastery." Mastery implies deep expertise in a subject while also suggesting a comprehensive understanding of its full breadth.

### User - 2023-10-10 16:37:16

Given this statement: "You escalate early and efficiently when you get blocked, stuck, overloaded, or see a better way to achieve our goals."

We got feedback: "the word 'your' might feel more empowering here while meaning effectively the same"

My response was: "I'm torn on this. I love the empowerment angle, but I also don't want people to think that they can only escalate when they see a better way to achieve their goals but also if they see a better way to achieve any of our goals. Let me noodle on this a bit."

Suggest a phrasing that captures the empowering feeling of "your" while also not limiting people to just their personal scope. Keep the original phrasing as much as possible.

### Assistant - 2023-10-10 16:37:20

Given the feedback and your response, here's a suggested phrasing:

"You escalate early and efficiently when you get blocked, stuck, overloaded, or see a better way to achieve your goals or any of our shared goals."

This phrasing integrates the personal empowerment of "your goals" while also emphasizing the broader, collective aspect with "any of our shared goals."

### User - 2023-10-10 16:37:43

Can we try for a couple options without the "or" clause between "your goals or any of our shared goals"

### Assistant - 2023-10-10 16:37:47

Of course! Here are a couple of options:

1. "You escalate early and efficiently when you get blocked, stuck, overloaded, or see a better way to achieve your goals within our shared objectives."
 
2. "You escalate early and efficiently when you get blocked, stuck, overloaded, or identify opportunities to enhance both your goals and our shared vision."

These phrasings attempt to seamlessly integrate the personal and collective aspects.

### User - 2023-10-10 16:38:40

Let's start over again. Ignoring what I said before, what are ways to rephrase this to be more empowering? "You escalate early and efficiently when you get blocked, stuck, overloaded, or see a better way to achieve our goals."

### Assistant - 2023-10-10 16:38:46

Certainly! Here are some empowering rephrasings:

1. "Take the initiative to escalate promptly and effectively when facing challenges, seeking guidance, or envisioning a superior approach to realize our goals."
  
2. "Empower yourself to voice concerns and solutions early on, whether you're encountering obstacles or spotting better avenues to meet our objectives."

3. "Be proactive in escalating when you encounter roadblocks, feel overwhelmed, or identify innovative strategies to advance our collective goals."

4. "When faced with challenges or inspired by a more effective solution, confidently escalate to ensure we're always moving towards our shared objectives."

These rephrasings aim to promote a sense of agency, confidence, and proactive behavior in individuals.

Original statement: "You generally work with a handful of people, mostly in your team (including cross-functional partners)."

Feedback: It's not clear that "including cross-functional partners" was meant to indicate that your team includes cross-functional partners. 

What is a clearer way of stating this? 

### Assistant - 2023-10-10 16:46:08

To clarify the original statement, consider this rephrasing:

"You generally work with a handful of people, primarily within your team, which includes cross-functional partners."

This structure makes it evident that the cross-functional partners are a part of the team.

### User - 2023-10-10 16:53:12

In this statement, the term "relay" feels like a somewhat obscure usage. Please suggest alternatives: You influence the direction of the engineering organization. You uplift entire teams, and you actively shape the engineering team’s culture. You act as a strong relay for the company direction, detecting misalignments, and providing missing context.

### Assistant - 2023-10-10 16:53:19

Certainly. The term "relay" can be replaced with more straightforward phrasing. Here are some alternatives:

1. "You act as a vital conduit for the company direction, detecting misalignments, and providing missing context."
  
2. "You serve as a key channel for communicating the company's direction, identifying misalignments, and filling in any gaps in understanding."

3. "You function as a pivotal link in conveying the company's direction, spotting inconsistencies, and supplying necessary context."

4. "You play an essential role in transmitting the company's direction, noticing discrepancies, and offering the missing perspective."

Each of these alternatives aims to make the statement more transparent by replacing "relay" with terms that more clearly convey the idea of communication and connection.

Comment: 
I heard IC4 described at "can solve complex problems with other people" and IC5/Staff then adding on top "can hand-off complex projects to other teams". I think there's something to that: ability to hand-off stuff. Do you think that fits in here or do you think it's worth mentioning in the "Successful engineers" doc?

Response: I like this, but I want to make sure that we phrase in a way that isn't easy to confuse with dropping problems on other people's laps. Maybe something like: You identify the right project owners and help those owners execute effectively."

What I don't like about the response is that it doesn't clearly capture the idea of handoff. Suggest a phrasing that better gets at the idea of identifying owners and handing off effectively.

### Assistant - 2023-10-10 16:59:28

Certainly! Here's a phrasing that emphasizes the idea of identifying the right owners and effectively handing off tasks:

"You discern the appropriate project owners and facilitate a smooth and effective handoff, ensuring continuity and successful execution."

This version emphasizes both the selection of the right person or team and the process of transferring responsibility in a supportive manner.
