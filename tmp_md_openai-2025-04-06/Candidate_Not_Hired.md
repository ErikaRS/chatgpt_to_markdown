Make this clearer and to the point while retaining the original style: No hire. Technically, this candidate is very strong. They clearly understand the domain they work in and can talk about it in detail, answering all of the deep dive questions we threw at them. My concerns are on the PM side. The candidate's experience demonstrates that they've mostly worked on fairly small scale projects where they were working very hands on with a small group of people. They may meet the IC3 bar, but my concern is that they will not help me solve the problems I need them so solve. If we were hiring them as PM for just the Platform team, I could see them being a good fit. However, when I look at the problems we need someone to solve to help Search Suite move in the right direction, I need someone with more breadth of experience.

Not hired. The candidate is technically proficient and understands their domain deeply. However, their project management experience is limited to smaller projects with a few individuals. They might fit an IC3 role, but for our broader Search Suite needs, we require someone with a wider range of experience.
