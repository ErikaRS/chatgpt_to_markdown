The second image you provided is also associated with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but it features a different color scheme. Here are the key differences between the two images:

1. **Color**: 
   - The first logo is in a purple color.
   - The second logo is in a blue color.

2. **Design**: 
   - Both logos maintain the same overall design, featuring a ribbon-like shape forming an angular "V" and "S" (for Visual Studio).
