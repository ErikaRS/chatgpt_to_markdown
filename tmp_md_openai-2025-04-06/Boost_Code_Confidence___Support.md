2. "Elevate our system understanding and bolster team readiness for optimal support."
3. "Empower our team with a deeper grasp of the code for superior system support."
4. "Cultivate confidence in our code to ensure robust system reasoning and support."

Here's more information. The team is small compared to the size of the legacy system they need to handle. They need to reduce the maintenance burden of the system. Examples of how we would do this include adding end to end tests and removing an obsolete service. Don't include the examples but give 5 ways to simplify this description of the objective of the work: "Get the code and the team to a level of confidence about our systems that allows us to reason about it, and provide great support "

Given the additional context, here are five simplified descriptions of the objective:

1. "Strengthen our small team's mastery over the large legacy system for effective support."
2. "Boost the team's capability to confidently manage and support the expansive legacy system."
3. "Optimize the legacy system to ease maintenance and enhance our team's confidence in support."
4. "Elevate our team's efficiency in handling the vast legacy system and ensuring reliable support."
5. "Streamline the legacy system to reduce its burden and empower our compact team's support efforts."
