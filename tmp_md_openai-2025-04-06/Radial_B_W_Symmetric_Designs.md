A radially symmetric black and white image (pure black and white, no gray) that has a small number of abstract images going from larger and more detailed in the middle to smaller and less detailed on the edges

Add even more layers of less detail until it feels like the image is going off into infinity. It should invoke feelings of the numinous

A lot of these images have the commonality that they start with small elements in the middle and get larger. Invert that and make something with large elements in the middle and small on the outside. It should give the impression of looking at a sphere

Here are the designs inspired by the fusion of traditional Persian textile art and the optical illusions associated with early 20th-century graphic artwork. The central motifs, reminiscent of Azra Aghighi Bakhshayeshi, blend seamlessly with patterns evoking the style of MC Escher, creating a profound spherical illusion. This focus has been captured through a square crop, emphasizing the depth and intricacies. Please let me know if this aligns with your vision or if there are further adjustments or designs you'd like to explore!

A graphic images of triangles, roughly radially situated, getting smaller as they move away from the center of a canvas

    "Graphic illustration of a radial design composed of triangles. These triangles are situated in a manner that they emanate from the center of the canvas. As the triangles spread outwards, they progressively decrease in size, creating a sense of depth and movement away from the center.",

Like the second one but fill the whole square and make it so that the outer triangles are noticably smaller than the inner ones

Here are the designs with triangles in a radial arrangement. The contrast between the larger triangles in the center and the noticeably smaller ones towards the edges is emphasized, and the entire square canvas is filled. Please let me know if these designs meet your expectations or if there are further adjustments you'd like to make!

Like the right one, but the outermost triangles are so small that you almost can't tell they are triangles anymore.

Here are the revised designs with triangles in a radial arrangement. The triangles at the center are notably larger, and as they spread outwards, they become so tiny towards the edges that they are almost indistinguishable. Please let me know if this aligns with your vision or if you'd like further adjustments!
