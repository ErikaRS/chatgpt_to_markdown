Here are the raw notes I took on Ashley Goodall's _The Problem with Change_. Create a summary that is approximately 5 paragraphs long which: gives an overall assessment of the book followed by a high level yet thorough summary of the key points of the book. The summary should be in the same overall style of the notes, reusing fragments of the text where possible. 

#### I. LIFE IN THE BLENDER
Organizational change is endless and rarely has the positive impact it's supposed to have. Often, it makes things worse, definitely worse for the individuals and often without having any positive business impact either. 

Organizational change often introduces periods of uncertainty where it is hard for people to do anything because they don't know what will be valuable. Even those who start out hopeful about the change become disappointed when the uncertainty stretches out. 

Change efforts often last months or even years. They overlap with each other. And once started, they are rarely pause and reconsidered, even if they are not going well. 
> This — the uncertainty, the turmoil, the exhaustion, the disempowerment, the disengagement, and the slim and tenuous hope that it will all be okay in the end —is organizational change in action, and it's very hard to come away from conversations about it without questioning the proposition that the way we do change today is by its very nature a good thing, and that change itself is an unalloyed good. 

This doesn't mean that change should always be avoided. Change is sometimes necessary. The stated goals of change efforts are often laudable. 

Style note: I like having concrete examples, but they were a bit much and ended up belaboring the point. 
#### II. THE CULT OF DISRUPTION
In the modern business world, disruption is seen as a good in its own right, as illustrated by the popularity of *The Innovator's Dilemma*. While Christensen's message  came with nuance, it has become part of a general attitude that change and disruption are good in their own right. 

This loses track of the core observation that *change* and *improvement* are different things. The difference is between "We need to fix this problem, therefore, we need to change" and "We need to change, because then all the problems will be fixed." 

Change became associated with getting better, but that is not always the case. For example, most mergers and acquisitions destroy values according to business studies, and most layoffs have a negative impact on business value (even ignoring the very real human impact). 

When proposing change, we need to account for the full cost to decide whether or not a change yields a true benefit. 

Style note: This chapter was a bit ranty. 
#### III. THE PROBLEM WITH CHANGE
- The problem of uncertainty
- The problem of lack of control
- The problem of unbelonging
- The problem of displacement
- The problem of loss of meaning

This chapter goes into the costs of change. These costs have negative costs to both motivation and health.
>  Change severs our relationship to the future, and thereby creates uncertainty. It severs our ability to shape that future, and calls into question our individual agency. It severs our relationships with other people, and imperils our sense of belonging. It severs our connection to our surroundings, and displaces us. It severs the connection between what we do at work and what results from it, and so upends our sense of the meaningfulness of our work. And it severs the link between our abilities and our impact, and thus challenges our own competence.

**Uncertainty** effects humans worse than directly experienced negative effects. Uncertainty is a form of anxiety, a feeling akin to fear but without an object or ending. It is unbounded. At work, uncertainty arises when we lack credible safety signals. It can bias us toward behaviors that we feel will bring closure. We grab hold of what will bring certainty, even if that leads to bias. 

**Lack of control** comes when we begin to learn about change and realize how little agency we have in the outcome. At work, conditions are frequently changed without our say-so. Over time, this can lead to learned helplessness, where people stay in negative situations because they don't realize they can escape. In the workplace, many attempts to help increase certainty end up doing so at the cost of a sense of control by making decisions for people. Given individuals agency to enact change that will make a difference can recreate a sense of control. 

**Unbelonging** is a problem because humans are deeply social. Being ostracized is a deeply negative experience. People want to form and maintain at least a minimal number of "lasting, positive, and significant interpersonal relationships." Maintaining these bonds requires frequent, enjoyable, stable, ongoing interactions. People want to belong, yet organizational change often disrupts the human bonds that have formed, pulling teams and organizations apart. The ends of these relationships are painful (even when they're intentionally temporary). Groups are also important because we  allow those we are closer to more complexity; we tend to flatten those on the outside. Loneliness causes many negative effects, and when we sever stable bonds, people can be lonely at work, even in a crowd. 

**Displacement** occurs when people are removed from the environments they are connected to. We become attached to places. Disrupting this can crate of nostalgia which, despite it's bittersweet associations, originated as a description of a form of suffering. The longer we are in a place, the more attached we become. This attachment to place can serve as a safe base from which we can explore which implies that the more uncertain the environment, the more valuable a safe home base becomes. This sense of attachment also applies to the layers of routines that make up everyday life. When formalized, these routines can become explicitly meaning-making rituals. And disrupting the space, routine, and ritual of work life can be just as disruptive as in personal life. 

**Loss of meaning** arises when people lose touch with what their work means, both in terms of coherence and significance. People are natural sense makers, and meaning and purpose are how we make sense of our work. When we don't know what we're doing or why, we are hard pressed to find that sense of meaning at work. Meaning is created from our ability to tell stories about our experiences. They reveal the why. This can come from relationships and identity. It can also come from skill and impact. And meaning must come from within. While a larger group's meaning can help, it won't resonate if we don't internalize it.  Change can negatively impact both coherence and significance. 

Style notes: Lots of pointing at experiments which kind of belabor the key points. 

#### IV. SKU-MAN TO HUMAN
Why is it that leaders tend to ignore the cost of change? There is a tendency to treat people as generic "SKU-mans", our simplified model of the human at work, than as rich, multi-faceted humans. The ideology of shareholder value undervalues people because we don't know how to value human experience and individual performance — and the things that impact it negatively — in dollars. The business world treats people like interchangeable widgets, and we lack the tools for understanding the value of good management or the negative impact of exploitative management. 

This model of people tends to oversimplify how we are motivated. When we look inside for what motivates each of us, we emphasize intrinsic motivations. When we look at other people, we tend to assume they are more motivated by extrinsic motivations. In the workplace, this becomes an emphasis on extrinsic motivators and a deemphasis on the intrinsic. This also leads to lower trust since a strong focus on extrinsic motivation leads us to doubt that people will do the right thing when they aren't being monitored or otherwise extrinsically controlled. 

Another challenge of this simplified model of people is that leaders and workers often live in very different worlds, so leaders will cause harm because they don't realize that their experience of change is very different from that of the people in the organization. And a bias towards positivity and stymied information flow make it hard even for leaders who want to understand the impact of their decisions to have a realistic understanding. 

The tools of organizations, how they structure incentives, org structure, roles, and performance management, tend to emphasize the flat SKU-man view of individuals. Attempts to cheer people up tend to be shallow. 

A better approach is to treat people as fully humans: unique, intrinsically motivated, and skilled with a desire to learn, be useful, and get better. We are "ultra-social learning machines". We get attached to places and people. We resist simplification. We desire certainty. We want to help. And we want to improve things a little each day. 

Work does not need to create this positive attributes. It need to support them. But much of what we see actively blocks these basic human desires. 
> In a human-first, people-up world, the ultimate job of leadership is not disruption and it is not to create change; it is to create a platform for human contribution, to create the conditions in which people can do the best work of their lives. This necessarily includes setting the stage for people to build their skills, to find meaning in their work, to establish a sense of belonging and place, and to experience their own agency. It includes making work a source, as much as possible, of stability, not churn. And it requires that, at work, we rediscover both humans and humanity. 

Style note: The bit about Milton Friedman and the negative impact of shareholder value was true but also somewhat ranty. As are various other sections. Also, often the sections were interesting but seemed to lack an overall contribution to the broader argument. 

#### V. RETHINK
- Make space 
- Forge undeniable competence
- Share secrets
- Be predictable
- Speak real worlds
- Honor ritual 
- Focus most on teams
- Radicalize HR
- Pave the way

The demands our organizations face are constantly changing, so what are we to do given the damage caused by change initiatives? We can change our mindset so that instead of asking "When do we start?" we ask "Should we really?" Still, sometimes the answer is yes. When change needs to happen, we can slow the pace and take a more deliberate approach, one which takes into account the costs of change. We can aim for a sense of dynamic stability which inoculates against chaost.

This chapter is really more like multiple chapters, one per technique for building a better workplace.

**Make space**
Create space for people to succeed. This is the opposite of micromanaging, where a manager tightly circumscribes the actions of those around them, making them fear making their own decisions. Instead, we can create the space, the daylight, for people to run toward. Leadership should provide empowerment, permission, and guidance. 

Ways to do this:
- Realize the ways in which you are filling space and vacate it:
    - Listen instead of talking to make space for others' words
    - Share information instead of instructions to make space for others' decisions
    - Ask questions instead of giving answers to make space for others to shape a solution (this includes framing a strategy as a hypothesis to be tested instead of a set of decisions)
    - Describe problems instead of solutions to make space for contributions
    - Describe ends not means to make space for individual initiative
    - Subtract projects instead of adding them to create more energy
- A less intuitive technique is to add constraints. 
    - When there are no limits, people find it hard to navigate. 
    - Adding walls, boundaries, constraints, can create a sense of space where, previously, too little constraint made it hard to realize where to go. 
- Look for organizational processes which steal space
    - Performance management systems are a chief culprit. They erode agency and force people into a particular mold.
    - A better approach is the weekly check-in. Each week, a team member answers four questions. They send their answer to their team leader. The team leader finds time to talk and asks questions to understand what made the difference (good or bad) the previous week. The leader then figures out how to provide whatever help the team member needs. This process is driven by the team member, and they can skip it if they wish (but the leader must always respond when the team member does answer). The questions:
        - What did you love about last week?
        - What did you loathe about last week? 
        - What are your priorities for this week?
        - What held do you need from me \[the team leader\]?
    - Check-ins are powerful because they are 
        - predictable (weekly): this makes them something team members can rely on and creates space for conversations that don't seem worth scheduling time for. 
        - frequent: unlike performance conversations that happen a couple times a year, leading to abstract conversations about performance from long ago, check-ins are real time and more concrete.
        - attention: traditional performance management is about assessment: ratings, feedback, reviews. Check-ins are about attention: paying attention to what the team member needs at any given point in time. 

All together, making space is about letting go. Accept that when you make space, others will do things differently. This signals trust in others. 

**Forge undeniable competence**
People will feel motivated, energized, and delighted when they feel like their work allows them to be highly competent. This is not just a matter of technical or interpersonal skills. We need to be aware of our skills and how they make us great at our work. We need to know that we can tackle the challenges that come our way. 

The modern workspace can disconnect us from this sense of competence when it feels like the work we do never goes anywhere. You work hard, you prepare, you share, and... nothing. Feelings of undeniable competence when you see that the things you work on, especially the things you work hard on, deliver value. You need to be able to see the cause and effect. Annual goals that aren't really within an employee's control, attempts to quantify and measure output, these rarely give this clarity. A clear, undeniable competence is a local property and cannot be captured by global, big picture tools which flatten away the nuance of individual agency. 

What we can do instead is look for ways to recognize specific, concrete instances in authentic ways, in the moment. The chapter uses the example of a handshake given only for truly noteworthy performance. The small gap between action and response and the constraint that recognition is only given for things that truly deserve it can make these gestures meaningful and motivating. Gestures like this need to be immediate, direct, and on as personal a scale as possible. 

And we must focus on excellence, not failure. This is because excellence tells people what to aim for, not only what to avoid. Excellent provides a path for growth. Then they can find their own way toward it. Excellence creates a sense of safety and helps us feel rooted. When people know what excellence looks like and that they are achieving it, they know they belong. Excellence fosters both stability and growth. 
> Excellence is quirky. Particular. Peculiar. Inimitable. It doesn't, therefore, come with assembly instructions beyond these: Aim high, and keep what works. Making excellence tangible fuels the first of these and illustrates the second. 

Some examples of concrete ways to recognize excellence in the moment. Don't just say "good job" but also include concrete details of what made it good. 
- "That's a super email — can I tell you why I think so?"
- "I hadn't thought of that point at all — do you have a moment to explain more?"
- "I loved what you said there, and here's why."
- "That! Yes, that!"
- "Can I tell you why that stood out for me?"
- "Do you know what I found most persuasive about that?"
- "I loved that. How on earth did you decide to do it that way?"
- "Wow — where did you learn that?"
- "Fantastic! Well done, you!"

**Share secrets**
Most orientation events connect new employees with a bunch of people who they will not be working with directly and focus on high level values which tend to be generic. These values, mission statements, high level philosophies, fail to convey any special truth, any sense of what it means to be one of *us*. 

Instead, we should focus on helping people quickly build a sense of connection with the people they will be working with day-to-day. We should encourage a sense of belonging and community.  One way of doing this is to help people understand the inside knowledge, the "secrets" that make them feel like they are truly part of an organization. This is the information that makes an organization unique not generic, which gives a sense of history rather than focusing on an unrealized future, and which are only known by people who are part of the group. 

These "secrets" need not literally be secrets. Instead they can be like family stories: things that someone is unlikely to know unless they are truly part of the organization. These stories get shared by word of mouth, generation after generation, and create a sense of intimacy. They are direct, real, and unedited. And, as such, they often can be somewhat ambiguous: they're not "good" or "bad"; they are just part of what makes us *us*. Often, these can look like gossip, which is an integral tool for creating a sense of community and belonging. 

We must recognize the value of these stories. They cannot be invented. They must arise organically over time. And they are a limited resource which means that if an organization destroys the value of these stories, they will not be easily replaced.

**Be predictable**
We want to feel confidence about the future, but confidence about the future doesn't come from being told how wonderful the future is going to be. Sometimes an aspirational future can be inspiring, but often it also ends up creating skepticism. Either way, it these visions don't create confidence. 

What does create confidence is our ability to predict how people, especially leaders, will behave. The more tightly we can identify our mental model of a person, the higher our confidence in them. This means that we are most confident in people who have a consistently identified, tightly clustered set of key attributes. This gives rise to confidence because it allows us to make higher quality predictions about how others will behave. 
> To the extent that our understanding feels more comprehensive, we feel more confident in our predictions. To the extent that the people around us are easier to read, our understanding of them will feel more comprehensive. And to the extent that the people around us act consistently, from one team member to another, from one day to the next, and from one situation to another, they will be easier to read.

This is not about being any one particular way. We can each be predictable in our own distinct way. One way that one could look at predictability is making our distinctness more apparent, thus tightening our cluster of characteristics more tightly around the true self that drives our underlying behavior. If we can be ourselves, we are much less likely to "forget our lines". 

It's harder for a leader to communicate their distinct self to those they seldom or never meet with. They need to be able to affect the experience of others at scale. Authenticity and distinctness come into play here too. The more an individual has a distinct style, the further their trait penetrate into an organization. In fact, those further away might have a more distilled sense of the leader's personality because they don't see the more complex day-to-day reality that you see when you work directly with another person. 

**Speak real words**
This was a somewhat ranty section about the problems of corp speak. Companies are always moving the goal posts, renaming initiatives, updating the strategy. All this adds up to confusion and a sense of unnecessary change. Low-meaning phrasings also contribute to this since they replace concrete meaning with vague cliché that is useless in telling us what we should actually be doing. Hyperbole, overuse of adjectives, and substitute phrases (e.g., "decided to move on") can play a similar role. This separates reality and our descriptions of it, which reduces our ability to predict what will happen yet, reduces our trust in leaders, and makes us disinclined to speak truthfully about our own experiences, 

Instead, what we need to do is speak real words. We need to chose words that are clear. In the words of Winston Churchill:
> Short words are best, and the old words, when short, are best of all.

Why? Because short words tend to be clear. And old words tend to have more settled meanings. More complex words and more recent coinages leave room for ambiguity. This doesn't mean that new words never have value. New things need new terms, but we should be wary of new words that merely provide cover for imprecise thinking. A good word needs to be able to how up to inquiry: what does that mean? how does that work? 

Unreal words may be used to intentionally confuse or to cover up unclear thinking. However, they are also used when we want to try to protect others from the harsh side of reality: to soften the blow or protect from uncertainty. We must learn to address harsh realities in a way that is direct and honest:
- Describe what you are seeing
- Narrate what will happen next
- Give a reason for the other person to feel better

This is more effective than trying to hide away the problem, pretend there is a solution when there isn't, or telling people what to feel. We should focus on drawing attention to what we think is important and invite others to see the world as we do, without commanding it. What we learn when we do this is that people can generally handle the truth quite well as long as it is rooted in reality and given the information to make sense of the situation on our own. 

**Honor ritual**
Humans are creatures of habit and ritual. They help us with sense making and belonging. There is no single definition of a ritual. They can be formal or informal, instrumental or disconnected from their nominal goal, one off or part of a larger pattern, created by participants or created by others, done in response to an event or done as part of a repetitive schedule, communal or individual. Rituals can fit any of these patterns. Whatever their form, they are ritual because of the way we feel about them. What links all of these rituals is that they feel meaningful to those who accept the validity of the ritual. 

Engaging in ritual can improve our competence and sense of control, such as in pre-game rituals in sports. They can help regulate our emotions, whether it's a ritual to pump us up or calm us down, help us focus or inspire awe. Rituals at work can enhance our sense of meaning at work. Group rituals can make us feel more connected to our work and to each other. They can also help to reinforce a sense of identity. 

These rituals need not be formal; for example, team trivia night could be a meaningful ritual. What matters is their predictability which helps build a scaffolding into the future and reduces our sense of uncertainty. They reduce the variance of the future and bring us closer together. 

At work, ritual can look like regular meetings — if they're the kind with leaders talking about what's going on in real words (conversation more than presentation). The content brings a sense of connection, but it's also the *regularity* that creates a sense of predictability and ritual.  

Async communication can also take on ritual form. E.g., sending a weekly email every week, even if only to say that there's nothing to say that week. Ritual can also come in the form of responses to known milestones such as product launch rituals or sharing significant personal events. (However, the week is a special unit of time for people, so it can be a useful cadence to build on.)

A key challenge of ritual is to carry it out consistently. Part of their power is that we make a communal commitment to their continuation. Their regularity is what allows them to glue together space and time. Rituals often develop slowly over time. This means that we should honor them and support them. We should elevate the ones that already exist instead of trying to create new ones. And we should realize that when we upset rituals, the impact is more than logistical. We are upsetting the "mental metabolism of the human creature". 

**Focus most on teams**
Teams are the most important organizational unit, but companies under invest in them 

High performance is built off of high quality teams. This is because the factors that connect to individual performance are directly caused by or are mediated through an individual's experience on a team. 
> Our team is the prism for our experience at work and refracts every element of it: It is the container for our self-expression and contribution; the incubator of our collective sense of belonging and norms; and the mediator of our relationship with the larger organization. (Page 206)"

These factors include:
- Company factors which describe a person's relationship to a company as a whole
    -  "I am really enthusiastic about the mission of my company."
    - "I have great confidence in my company's future."
- Team factors which describe a person's experience on their team
    - "In my team, I am surrounded by people who share my values." 
    - "My teammates have my back."
- Individual experience of work, which is often mediated by one's experience on a team
    - "At work, I clearly understand what is expected of me."
    - "I have the chance to use my strengths every day at work."
    - "In my work I am always challenged to grow."
    - "I know I will be recognized for excellent work."

Teams provide stability by providing a home for competence, a place we can use and develop our expertise. They provide a sense of social belonging and connection to the larger company through our more intimate connection to the team. Teams are where we find a sense of purpose and meaning, connecting broader goals to a scale where we can make an individual difference. We may think of this happening at the company level, but the team is where it becomes real. 

Yet much of what companies do to improve well being and performance is focused either at the company level or the individual level. We should hire people onto specific teams, giving them a sense of the team culture. We should onboard people to a specific team, it's values and ways of working. We should reward (e.g., through bonuses) at the level of the team, not individuals. We should set goals at the team level, not the individual level. We should evaluate team performance, not individual performance, and we should evaluate individual performance relative to how the individual added to or detracted from the performance of the team. We should train people in new skills or knowledge in teams, not as individuals, so that the team can put the new knowledge in place together (especially for collaboration skills). 

Leaders lack visibility into teams. They can be hard to track because they are often dynamic. Leaders may not have visibility into what it is like to work on better teams or which teams are doing a better at connecting dots on the meaning of their work or harnessing diversity or creating space or putting their strengths to work... so many of the things that determine the value of the day-to-day experience of individuals are rooted in teams. 

Because leaders lack this visibility, companies tend to break up teams without much thought, treating individuals as independent units. This is one of the most destructive elements of thoughtless change. 
>  We tend to assume that strength in the face of adversity, or steadfastness, or resilience, are individual things. But they're not: They are collective. We draw strength from those around us; our love for our little platoons is our love for our fellows, and in this love we are fortified. When it comes to our ability to survive life in the blender, it's not so much that grit makes the most difference, or perseverance, or even skill. It is whether or not we are alone. (Page 221)

**Radicalize HR**
HR has been set up to advance the interests of the business. However, the business is not all that matters. People have their own individual interests, and the role of pay and benefits, traditionally, was to help make up for the gap. However, this approach doesn't capture the complexity of human needs. HR needs to be more than just a representative of the business. It also needs to be a representative of the human needs of the employees. This doesn't mean being soft on people. It means that HR should be a true representative of what helps people do their job. Not at the cost of the business, but taking seriously that there is an overlap between the needs of the business and the needs of the individuals employed. HR should be an advocate for employees and their frontline experience. 

One way they can do this is by making the overlap between the interests of the business and the interests of the individuals as large as possible. They should look for the areas, such as great teams, that support both sets of interests. They should look for what both people and the business need. This is a radical proposition related to today's common conception of HR. This requires HR to have a detailed, realtime picture of what the experience of employees looks like. 

The annual survey is not the right way to do this. Instead, this book recommends surveys at the level of teams, with the team leader as the intended audience. These results should not be shared more broadly with the organization and should not be used as a way to hold individual leaders accountable. But leaders should be held accountable for using these surveys and their results. This puts high quality data in the hands of those most able to use it. 

The book also suggests matching HR generalists with teams rather than with senior leaders. They should be accountable to every team leader in the organization, not just senior leaders. These HR generalists should be involved in teaching team leaders how to most effectively lead their teams. Leaders are often thrown into leadership with little training based on their strength as individual contributors. This approach does not set up the leader or the team for success. We must help train them in leadership. 

**Pave the way**
Desire paths show the ways that people act in practice, even when they are at odds with the official trails. This is a good thing. Desire paths show the ways that people have discovered easier, more efficient ways to get things done. Desire paths can seem threatening because the non-standard ways of doing things could lead to problems or mistakes. However, if we trust people to be the experts on their own work, then desire paths can provide opportunity — if companies are willing to learn from them. 

When a valuable desire path has been discovered, companies should pave them — figure out how to make these alternate approaches work for others. This allows the best practices to be captured and shared. Often, the desire path will both better achieve a business result and better achieve human needs such as autonomy, competence, belonging, predictability, understanding, and ritual. 

#### CODA: ROOTED
A lovely discussion of the idea of feeling rooted as the less mechanical counterpart of stability.

Ashley Goodall’s *The Problem with Change* offers a critical perspective on organizational change, emphasizing the significant toll that constant and poorly managed changes impose on both individuals and organizations. Rather than treating change as an inherent good, Goodall argues that businesses should carefully consider the costs of change, recognize the nuances of human experience, and seek ways to foster environments where employees can thrive. The book combines practical insights with research-based observations, offering a compelling critique of the modern obsession with disruption and the unchecked belief in the benefits of continuous change.

Goodall opens with an exploration of the experience of “life in the blender,” where organizational change is a never-ending cycle. Change initiatives are often launched with good intentions, but they frequently lead to confusion, burnout, and disengagement. Employees are caught in prolonged periods of uncertainty where they struggle to determine what actions are valuable, and this instability takes a toll on morale. The broader business impact is often negligible or even negative. While acknowledging that some change is necessary, Goodall argues that many change efforts proceed without sufficient consideration of their real effects, leading to a culture where disruption is mistakenly equated with progress.

The second section, “The Cult of Disruption,” delves into the roots of this obsession with change. Goodall critiques how ideas like those in *The Innovator’s Dilemma* have contributed to a business environment that glorifies disruption for its own sake, even when it fails to deliver tangible improvements. The distinction between change and improvement is critical here; too often, organizations leap into changes with the assumption that they will automatically yield benefits. Goodall highlights the importance of accounting for the full costs — financial, human, and cultural — before embarking on major initiatives, warning that many of these costs are ignored in the pursuit of an illusory better future.

The heart of the book outlines “The Problem with Change” by examining the psychological and social costs of change: uncertainty, loss of control, unbelonging, displacement, and loss of meaning. These elements profoundly affect both motivation and health. For instance, the pervasive uncertainty in times of change fuels anxiety, leading to behaviors driven by the need for closure rather than good judgment. The loss of control as changes are imposed from above erodes trust and can lead to learned helplessness. Unbelonging results from the disruption of stable teams and relationships, while displacement breaks our connection to familiar environments and routines, stripping away the sense of place that provides psychological safety. Finally, when the coherence and significance of work are undermined, employees lose their sense of meaning, leading to disengagement.

Goodall then shifts to practical advice in “SKU-man to Human” and “Rethink,” where he advocates for a more human-centered approach to leadership. Organizations often treat people as simplified “SKU-mans” — interchangeable units rather than fully realized individuals. This dehumanized perspective overlooks intrinsic motivations and the deep need for stability, connection, and competence. Goodall proposes a shift toward leadership that prioritizes creating environments where people can do their best work. This involves strategies like making space for employees to take initiative, fostering a sense of undeniable competence through meaningful recognition, and cultivating rituals and predictable behaviors that reinforce belonging and purpose. The emphasis is on dynamic stability, where change is introduced deliberately and thoughtfully, rather than as an unrelenting force.

The book concludes with actionable steps for rethinking organizational practices, from radicalizing HR to focus on both business and human needs, to paving desire paths — identifying and formalizing the informal, effective practices that naturally emerge in organizations. Goodall argues that the role of leadership is not to constantly drive change but to create a stable platform for human contribution. The ultimate aim is to build rootedness — a sense of stability that supports both individual well-being and sustained organizational success. *The Problem with Change* is a well-argued call for leaders to reconsider how they approach change, focusing less on disruption and more on nurturing the environments in which people can truly thrive.

Ashley Goodall’s *The Problem with Change* provides a critical examination of organizational change and its often-overlooked consequences. The book challenges the prevalent assumption that change, particularly disruptive change, is inherently beneficial. Through detailed analysis, Goodall argues that while change can be necessary, the way it is typically managed leads to negative outcomes for both organizations and employees. By exploring the psychological and social costs of change, Goodall provides a comprehensive framework for understanding why change initiatives frequently fail to deliver the promised benefits.

The book begins with an exploration of what it’s like to live through constant change. Goodall describes how organizations subject employees to overlapping and often endless cycles of change that foster uncertainty, disengagement, and exhaustion. Despite the good intentions behind these initiatives, they often do not achieve their intended goals. In fact, they frequently make things worse by leaving employees unsure of what is valuable or where to focus their efforts. Goodall highlights that the real issue isn’t change itself but the haphazard, unrelenting nature of how it’s introduced and managed.

In the second section, Goodall critiques the modern business culture that equates disruption with progress. The popularity of frameworks like *The Innovator’s Dilemma* has fueled a mindset where change is pursued for its own sake, rather than with a clear purpose. Goodall emphasizes that change is not synonymous with improvement and that many organizational changes fail because they overlook the actual costs involved, such as lost employee trust, diminished collaboration, and reduced productivity. By confusing change with progress, organizations often implement initiatives that, while bold on paper, are disconnected from the realities of business and human needs.

The core of the book delves into the specific ways change can be harmful, including the uncertainty it creates, the loss of control for employees, and the breakdown of belonging. Uncertainty, in particular, is shown to be more damaging than direct negative effects, as it triggers anxiety and fosters a search for closure at the expense of thoughtful decision-making. The other elements, such as the loss of agency, displacement from familiar routines and environments, and the disruption of meaning, combine to weaken motivation and overall well-being. Goodall argues that organizations often fail to consider these human factors when planning change initiatives, resulting in long-term negative impacts.

Goodall then proposes an alternative approach centered on treating people as fully human rather than as simplified models driven purely by extrinsic motivations. He suggests leadership should focus on creating stability and predictability while empowering employees to build skills, find meaning, and experience belonging in their work. Practical strategies include providing space for employees to contribute, recognizing excellence in real-time, and respecting the rituals and routines that ground employees’ work lives. Goodall’s framework advocates for dynamic stability — maintaining flexibility without compromising the human need for consistency and control.

The book concludes with actionable strategies for leaders and HR to better align organizational practices with human needs. For example, Goodall recommends shifting performance management toward regular, team-focused check-ins that emphasize support over evaluation. He also advocates for recognizing and formalizing informal "desire paths," the organic ways employees find to navigate their work effectively. Goodall’s approach highlights the importance of balancing business objectives with the fundamental aspects of human experience, urging leaders to rethink the role of change in driving organizational success.

In summary, *The Problem with Change* offers a thorough analysis of why organizational change often fails and presents a nuanced alternative that prioritizes stability, predictability, and human connection. Goodall’s emphasis on understanding the human side of change provides valuable insights for leaders seeking to navigate change more effectively. The book serves as a reminder that while change is inevitable, how it is managed determines whether it leads to progress or creates lasting harm.

Based on your notes, your critiques of *The Problem with Change* by Ashley Goodall include the following:

1. **Excessive Use of Concrete Examples**: While you appreciated the inclusion of concrete examples to illustrate key points, you felt that the author sometimes overused them, resulting in sections that belabored the point rather than reinforcing it concisely.

2. **Rant-Like Sections**: You noted that certain chapters, particularly the one on "The Cult of Disruption," had a tone that felt more like a rant than an objective analysis. This detracted from the clarity and focus of the arguments presented.

3. **Lack of Overall Contribution to the Broader Argument**: Some sections of the book were interesting but seemed disconnected from the overall thesis or lacked a clear connection to the broader argument. This led to a feeling that the content, while engaging, didn’t always contribute meaningfully to the book's main points.

4. **Repetitive or Belabored Points**: There were sections, especially in the chapter discussing the costs of change (e.g., uncertainty, loss of control), where the author pointed to numerous experiments and studies. While these references supported the argument, they sometimes felt excessive, leading to a loss of focus on the key takeaways.

5. **Somewhat Ranty Discussions on Shareholder Value and Leadership Models**: You observed that the critiques of the shareholder value model and some leadership practices were valid but were presented in a somewhat ranty manner, which could have been delivered more succinctly without losing their impact.

These critiques suggest that while the book offers valuable insights, its presentation could be tightened in places to maintain clarity and focus.
