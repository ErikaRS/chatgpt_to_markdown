Write a poem, of modern form, about the trials of life in a firm. Triumphant against challenge yet beset on each side. 

### Assistant - 2023-04-28 18:57:35

In the mazes of the firm, we tread and toil,
Navigating seas of glass, steel, and tile.
Wearing masks of bravery and guile,
Each face a story, a purpose, a trial.

We venture forth 'midst tempests of change,
Where the whispers of uncertainty arrange
Our lives in the realms of the unknown,
The seeds of resilience and courage are sown.

Through the labyrinthine corridors we stride,
Triumphant, yet beset on every side.
Challenges, like vultures, circle high,
Our spirits waver, but never die.

In the cauldron of ambition we are forged,
By the fires of competition we are scorched.
Yet, from the crucible we rise anew,
Mettle tested, our purpose true.

Together, we stand as a unified front,
Each success and defeat, we equally confront.
In the shifting tides of fortune's embrace,
We find our strength, our solace, our grace.

For in the end, it's not the wealth we amass,
Nor the fleeting victories that come to pass,
But the stories we write in the ledger of life,
The symphony of struggles, of love, and strife.

In the firm's embrace, we find our way,
Through trials and triumphs, come what may.
Bound by purpose, our spirits reside,
Triumphant against challenge, side by side.

Write a short  poem about coding assistants are awesome

### Assistant - 2023-04-28 19:14:25

In bytes and bits, they weave their art,
Coding assistants, masters of the smart.
Through tangled webs of logic's reign,
They forge connections, ease our strain.

A dance of digits, an arcane script,
In endless lines, their power's crypt.
Awesomeness imbued with every stroke,
Silent partners, as solutions they invoke.

In the shadows of our code, they reside,
Guiding us through the digital divide.
As we venture forth, our goals in sight,
Coding assistants, our beacon of light.
