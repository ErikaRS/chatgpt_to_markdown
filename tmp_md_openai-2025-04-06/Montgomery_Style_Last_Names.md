A Montgomery-style last name should evoke the same timeless and bucolic charm as L.M. Montgomeryâ€™s works. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Willowby**: Suggestive of nature, grace, and the soft whimsy present in Montgomery's works.
- **Cuthwood**: A blend of the familiar "Cuthbert" and a wooded, natural connotation.
- **Faircombe**: Combining "fair" (beauty or light) with "combe" (a valley or hollow).
- **Elmhurst**: Reflecting a stately, rural quality tied to nature.
- **Avondale**: Inspired by "Avonlea," blending sophistication and a nod to nature.

Each of these names carries a similar sense of character and setting to those found in Montgomery's stories. Let me know if you'd like more options or refinements!
