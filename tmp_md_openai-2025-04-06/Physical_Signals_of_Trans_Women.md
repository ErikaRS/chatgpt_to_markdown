What physical signals might I be picking up when I notice that a even a very well made up and surgically feminized trans woman is trans and not cis?

There are a number of subtle, often unconscious, physical signals that people may pick up when discerning gender, even with individuals who have undergone gender-affirming surgeries and treatments. Here are some of the factors that may contribute:

1. **Bone Structure**: Some aspects of bone structure, particularly in the face, are not easily changed through surgery. For instance, the brow ridge, jawline, and cheekbones may still reflect typical male development. However, many people undergo facial feminization surgeries to modify these features.
   
2. **Height and Proportions**: Cis women, on average, tend to have different height and body proportions compared to cis men. Although this varies widely, trans women may still have broader shoulders or larger hands and feet, even after transition.

3. **Voice**: Hormones cannot change the pitch of the voice for someone who has gone through male puberty. While voice training can help many trans women speak in a more typically feminine range, some tonal qualities and the resonance of the voice can be different from those of a cis woman.

4. **Hair Texture and Growth**: Hormones can affect hair growth patterns (thinning body hair, promoting scalp hair growth), but facial hair removal and the density or texture of body hair might still offer clues, especially if regrowth occurs.

5. **Skin Texture**: Estrogen can soften skin, but trans women may still retain a coarser skin texture in some areas of the body compared to cis women.

6. **Hand and Foot Size**: Trans women often have larger hands and feet than cis women, which can be subtle but noticeable for some people.

7. **Shoulder-to-Hip Ratio**: While hormones can redistribute fat and give a more typically feminine shape, many trans women retain broader shoulders in relation to their hips compared to cis women.

8. **Movements and Mannerisms**: Socialization can also play a role in how people move and gesture. Some trans women might retain or develop physical mannerisms that are traditionally associated with men, though many actively work on adopting more traditionally feminine mannerisms.

These signals are often subtle and not consciously recognized, and it’s important to note that everyone, cis or trans, exists on a broad spectrum of physical characteristics. Recognizing someone as trans does not diminish their gender identity but is often related to these cues that many people pick up on without fully realizing why.

Go into more detail about what about bone structure I might be noticing

### Assistant - 2024-10-05 23:15:09

When it comes to bone structure, there are several specific features in the face and body that are often associated with male versus female development. These features can influence how someone is perceived, even after gender-affirming surgeries. While hormone therapy can alter some aspects of soft tissue (like skin and fat distribution), bone structure is more resistant to change, though facial feminization surgery (FFS) can mitigate or reshape some of these traits.

### Facial Bone Structure

1. **Brow Ridge (Supraorbital Ridge)**: 
   - **Cis Male Traits**: Typically, the brow ridge is more pronounced in men due to the influence of testosterone during puberty, creating a more angular or prominent ridge above the eyes. This gives the forehead a more “shadowed” or deep-set appearance, which can be one of the most noticeable gender markers in the face.
   - **Cis Female Traits**: Women generally have smoother, less pronounced brow ridges. This difference in brow prominence can subtly affect how light falls on the face, influencing perception of gender.
   - **Trans Considerations**: Facial feminization surgery can reduce the prominence of the brow ridge, but if it remains slightly pronounced, it can be a subtle signal someone might pick up on.

2. **Forehead Shape**:
   - **Cis Male Traits**: Men’s foreheads tend to be higher, with a more backward slope or a slight protrusion. 
   - **Cis Female Traits**: Women tend to have rounder, more vertical foreheads.
   - **Trans Considerations**: Adjusting the forehead’s shape during FFS can soften this feature, but minor differences may still be perceptible.

3. **Jawline and Chin**:
   - **Cis Male Traits**: Men typically have a more angular or square jawline, with a wider, more prominent chin. The jaw itself may be wider, with sharper angles, giving the face a more defined appearance. The chin tends to be taller and more forward-protruding.
   - **Cis Female Traits**: Women usually have rounder, softer jawlines, with a more tapered chin. The chin is generally smaller and less pronounced.
   - **Trans Considerations**: While FFS can soften the jaw and chin significantly, minor features of bone shape may still remain that give the impression of a more angular or wider jaw, which can cue someone’s perception of gender.

4. **Cheekbones**:
   - **Cis Male Traits**: Men typically have flatter or lower cheekbones that don’t protrude as much when viewed from the front, but can still be prominent in a more lateral (side) view.
   - **Cis Female Traits**: Women often have higher, more pronounced cheekbones, which give the face a more defined, rounded contour, particularly when viewed from the front.
   - **Trans Considerations**: While cheekbone implants or reshaping procedures can enhance the prominence of cheekbones, subtle differences in the height or projection of the cheekbones might remain.

5. **Nose**:
   - **Cis Male Traits**: Men tend to have larger, broader noses with a more prominent bridge and nasal tip. The bridge of the nose might be straighter or slightly more pronounced.
   - **Cis Female Traits**: Women typically have smaller, narrower noses with a softer bridge and tip.
   - **Trans Considerations**: Rhinoplasty is common in FFS to reduce the size of the nose, but the remaining underlying bone structure could still give a more angular appearance, especially if not extensively reshaped.

### Body Bone Structure

1. **Shoulders and Collarbones**:
   - **Cis Male Traits**: Men tend to have broader shoulders and a wider clavicle (collarbone), which gives the upper body a more rectangular or V-shaped appearance. The proportions of the shoulders relative to the hips are often a significant gender cue.
   - **Cis Female Traits**: Women usually have narrower shoulders in proportion to their hips, giving a more hourglass-like silhouette.
   - **Trans Considerations**: Hormones and surgeries do not change the bone width of the shoulders, so even with a feminine shape and smaller frame, the shoulder width can still be a marker of male skeletal development.

2. **Hip and Pelvis Shape**:
   - **Cis Male Traits**: Men generally have narrower hips and a pelvis that is taller and more compact. This creates a more rectangular lower torso, with less waist definition.
   - **Cis Female Traits**: Women tend to have wider hips and a shorter, broader pelvis, giving the appearance of a more pronounced curve between the waist and hips.
   - **Trans Considerations**: While fat redistribution from hormone therapy can add to the appearance of wider hips, the underlying pelvic bone structure doesn’t change. This can affect how the waist-to-hip ratio appears, particularly in certain types of clothing.

3. **Hand and Foot Size**:
   - **Cis Male Traits**: Men tend to have larger hands and feet, with longer fingers and broader palms.
   - **Cis Female Traits**: Women generally have smaller hands and feet, with more slender fingers.
   - **Trans Considerations**: Hand and foot size are often impossible to change surgically, so the larger size can be a subtle cue that someone might unconsciously pick up.

### How These Traits are Perceived

While many trans women undergo surgeries to feminize their appearance, bone structure is one of the most resilient aspects of human anatomy to change. Many of these traits are nuanced, and people may not consciously recognize what they are seeing but can still register the combination of these signals as different from what they typically associate with a cisgender woman.

Most importantly, these signals often interact with other factors—voice, movement, skin texture—to contribute to a more holistic perception. Often, it’s not a single trait but a combination of features that informs this unconscious recognition. However, it’s worth noting that perceptions of gender are subjective and influenced by societal expectations, so not all individuals will pick up on or focus on the same signals.

How can makeup help balance some of the facial structure factors?

### Assistant - 2024-10-05 23:17:21

Makeup can be a powerful tool for balancing and reshaping the visual perception of facial structure, helping trans women feminize features that may otherwise signal a more traditionally masculine appearance. Here's how makeup can address specific aspects of facial structure:

### 1. **Brow Ridge and Forehead**
   - **Issue**: A pronounced brow ridge can make the forehead appear more angular or shadowed, which is typically associated with male features.
   - **Makeup Solution**:
     - **Highlighting**: Applying a lighter concealer or highlighter above the brows can draw attention away from the ridge and make the area appear smoother and more lifted. 
     - **Eyebrows**: Reshaping and filling in the eyebrows in a more traditionally feminine style—typically with a higher arch and a soft, tapered end—can help redirect attention away from the brow ridge. Thicker, more angular brows may emphasize masculine traits, while softer, thinner shapes feminize the face.

### 2. **Jawline and Chin**
   - **Issue**: A square or angular jawline and a more prominent chin can contribute to a masculine appearance.
   - **Makeup Solution**:
     - **Contouring**: Strategic contouring with a darker shade of makeup along the jawline can help soften the angles of the face. Blending the contour upward from the jawline creates a shadow that gives the illusion of a more tapered, narrower jaw.
     - **Highlighting the Center**: By highlighting the center of the face (nose, forehead, chin), the focus is drawn inward, making the edges of the face appear less prominent. This can help make a square jaw or larger chin seem less pronounced.

### 3. **Cheekbones**
   - **Issue**: Flat or lower cheekbones can give the face a less rounded, feminine contour.
   - **Makeup Solution**:
     - **Blush Placement**: Applying blush higher on the cheekbones (above the apples of the cheeks) helps to lift and accentuate this area, creating the illusion of higher, more prominent cheekbones.
     - **Contouring the Cheeks**: Using a darker contour shade just below the cheekbones can sculpt the cheeks and enhance their definition, making them appear more lifted. This can create a softer, more feminine curve to the face.

### 4. **Nose**
   - **Issue**: A wider or more angular nose can be a masculine feature.
   - **Makeup Solution**:
     - **Contouring**: Applying a darker contour along the sides of the nose and blending it toward the center helps narrow the appearance of the nose. Highlighting the bridge of the nose with a lighter shade can create a more streamlined, feminine look.
     - **Focus on Other Features**: Emphasizing other areas, such as the eyes or lips, can draw attention away from the nose and make it seem less prominent.

### 5. **Forehead Shape**
   - **Issue**: A more sloped or pronounced forehead can contribute to a masculine appearance.
   - **Makeup Solution**:
     - **Highlighting the Center**: Highlighting the center of the forehead while subtly contouring the temples can help balance the forehead’s shape, making it appear more vertical and rounded.
     - **Framing with Hair**: Though not technically makeup, hairstyles can help frame the face. Bangs, for example, can help cover a pronounced forehead and create a softer, more feminine look. Pairing this with makeup enhances the overall effect.

### 6. **Eyes**
   - **Issue**: The deep-set appearance that comes with a prominent brow ridge may make the eyes look smaller or more recessed.
   - **Makeup Solution**:
     - **Eyeshadow Techniques**: Using light, shimmery shades on the eyelids can help open up the eyes, making them appear larger and more forward. Avoid dark, heavy eyeshadows in the crease, as these can make the eyes appear deeper-set.
     - **Eyeliner and Mascara**: Winged eyeliner and applying mascara to both the upper and lower lashes can help create a more feminine, wide-eyed look. This can compensate for any recessed appearance caused by the brow ridge.
     - **False Lashes**: Using false eyelashes or emphasizing lashes with volumizing mascara can make the eyes appear larger and more prominent, which can feminize the overall look.

### 7. **Lips**
   - **Issue**: Masculine faces often have thinner lips, whereas fuller lips are generally associated with femininity.
   - **Makeup Solution**:
     - **Lip Liner**: Overlining the lips just slightly (outside of the natural lip line) with a lip liner and filling in with lipstick can make the lips appear fuller and more feminine.
     - **Lip Gloss or Highlight**: Applying a gloss or highlighter to the center of the lips can create the illusion of fuller, plumper lips. Choosing colors that complement the makeup style can also enhance the overall softness of the face.

### 8. **Overall Symmetry**
   - **Issue**: Symmetry is often associated with femininity. Even small asymmetries can sometimes be perceived as more masculine.
   - **Makeup Solution**:
     - **Balancing Techniques**: Makeup can correct or balance asymmetries. For example, contouring can make one side of the face appear more even, and precise application of products can help enhance symmetry across all features.

### Summary of Techniques
- **Contouring** (with a darker shade) helps minimize the appearance of more angular or prominent features.
- **Highlighting** (with a lighter shade) emphasizes softer, rounder areas, drawing attention away from masculine traits.
- **Blush and eyeshadow** can be applied in ways that create the illusion of higher cheekbones and larger eyes.
- **Lip techniques** can enhance the fullness and softness of the lips, a traditionally feminine feature.

By carefully applying makeup, trans women can significantly feminize the appearance of their facial structure, creating balance and softness in areas that might otherwise give cues of a more masculine bone structure. Makeup, combined with skillful contouring and highlighting, allows for nuanced changes that can greatly affect how the face is perceived.
