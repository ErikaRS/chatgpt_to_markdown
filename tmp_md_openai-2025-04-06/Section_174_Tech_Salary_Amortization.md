Section 174 of the U.S. tax code, known as the "Research and Experimentation (R&E) Expenditures," generally deals with how companies can deduct costs related to research and development (R&D) activities. 

Under recent changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, starting in 2022, businesses can no longer fully deduct R&E expenses in the year they are incurred. Instead, they must amortize these expenses over five years for domestic expenses and over fifteen years for expenses incurred outside the U.S.

While Section 174 specifically focuses on R&D expenditures, it has significant implications for tech companies, as employee salaries, particularly those tied to research, software development, or engineering, may fall under this category. This means that rather than immediately expensing salaries associated with R&D, companies now have to amortize these costs over several years.

This shift can affect cash flow for tech firms, particularly startups, as they need to spread out the deductions over a longer period rather than receiving the full tax benefit in the year the expenses are incurred.

Why was that change made? Who or what does it benefit?

The change to Section 174, which now requires research and development (R&D) expenses to be amortized over several years instead of being immediately expensed, was made as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). There are several reasons for this change, as well as groups that may benefit from it:

### Reasons for the Change
1. **Revenue Neutrality**: The TCJA aimed to significantly lower corporate tax rates and provide other tax benefits, but it also needed to offset the cost of these provisions to avoid dramatically increasing the federal deficit. By deferring R&D deductions over time (through amortization), the government could raise revenue in the short term. Immediate expensing provides an upfront tax benefit, but spreading deductions over several years defers the tax impact, thus temporarily increasing taxable income and raising tax revenue in the early years.

2. **Alignment with International Standards**: Many other countries already require R&D expenses to be capitalized and amortized, rather than immediately expensed. The shift in the U.S. brought its tax treatment more in line with international norms.

3. **Encouragement for Long-Term R&D Investments**: By spreading out the deduction, the change theoretically encourages businesses to think of R&D as a longer-term investment. The rationale is that businesses will invest in R&D projects with longer time horizons, knowing that they will recover the costs over multiple years.

### Who Benefits?
1. **Government Revenue**: In the short term, the primary beneficiary is the federal government, which collects more tax revenue by delaying when businesses can deduct their R&D expenses. This helped offset the cost of the tax cuts implemented in the TCJA.

2. **Established Companies with International R&D Presence**: Companies that already operate globally and are familiar with amortization requirements in other jurisdictions may be better positioned to handle this shift. They often have the financial flexibility to spread costs over several years, so the impact is more manageable for them than for smaller or U.S.-focused companies.

3. **Non-R&D-Intensive Companies**: The tax revenue generated from amortizing R&D expenses helped fund the broader corporate tax rate cuts under the TCJA. Companies that don't engage heavily in R&D, or that can capitalize on the reduced tax rates, may benefit from the overall reduced corporate tax rate (which dropped from 35% to 21%).

### Who Doesn't Benefit?
1. **Tech and R&D-Heavy Companies**: This change is particularly burdensome for tech startups and companies heavily reliant on R&D. These businesses often prefer immediate expensing of R&D costs to reduce their taxable income and improve cash flow. By forcing them to spread deductions over multiple years, it can increase tax liabilities in the short term, making it harder to invest in growth.

2. **Small and Mid-Sized Companies**: Companies without significant cash reserves or access to capital markets may find it more difficult to manage cash flow with this amortization requirement. These companies are more reliant on upfront tax savings to fund ongoing operations and reinvest in innovation.

Overall, while the change provided some short-term fiscal benefits for the government and created a more globally consistent tax framework, it has been a controversial move for many in the R&D-heavy tech sector, which has pushed for the reinstatement of immediate expensing for R&D costs.
