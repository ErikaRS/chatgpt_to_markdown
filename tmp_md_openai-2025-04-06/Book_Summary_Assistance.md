### Assistant - 2024-08-27 13:38:40

Here’s a summary of the main points from Anil Seth's _Being You_:

### 1. **The Nature of Consciousness**:
   - Seth explores consciousness as a biological phenomenon rather than something mysterious or immaterial. He proposes that consciousness is a form of controlled hallucination generated by the brain, grounded in the body's interactions with the world.

### 2. **The Self as a Construct**:
   - The book argues that the self is not a fixed entity but a fluid and dynamic construct. Seth describes how the brain creates different types of "self," such as the bodily self, the narrative self, and the social self, each with its own role in our experience.

### 3. **Predictive Processing**:
   - A key idea in Seth's work is that the brain operates on predictive processing, constantly generating and updating models of the world and the self. These predictions are compared with sensory input, and the resulting "errors" guide our perception and actions.

### 4. **Perception as Controlled Hallucination**:
   - Seth introduces the idea that perception is a kind of controlled hallucination, where the brain generates the world we experience based on predictions. This means that what we perceive is as much about what we expect to see as what is actually there.

### 5. **Consciousness and Life**:
   - Seth links consciousness closely to life itself, proposing that our sense of being alive is deeply connected to the brain's predictions about the body's internal states. This interoceptive process (monitoring the body's internal state) is central to the feeling of selfhood.

### 6. **Implications for AI and Understanding the Mind**:
   - The book explores the implications of these ideas for artificial intelligence and the possibility of conscious machines. Seth suggests that understanding consciousness in biological terms might help us better grasp the challenges and limits of AI.

### 7. **Ethical and Philosophical Questions**:
   - Seth touches on the ethical implications of his theory, particularly regarding the treatment of animals and the moral status of AI. He also engages with philosophical questions about free will, the nature of reality, and what it means to be "you."

### 8. **Applications to Mental Health**:
   - The book discusses how disorders of consciousness, such as depersonalization and certain psychiatric conditions, can be understood through this framework of predictive processing and controlled hallucination.

### 9. **The Future of Consciousness Studies**:
   - Seth outlines the future directions for research in consciousness, advocating for an interdisciplinary approach that combines neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and AI.

These are the core ideas presented in Anil Seth’s _Being You_, reflecting his scientific exploration of consciousness and the self.

#### Prologue

There is nothing that it's *like* to be under general anesthesia. One is just not there, in a way that goes beyond the absence of sleep. What this highlights is that under normal conditions, there is a sense of being there, of experiencing life in the first person, of *being you*.  

Consciousness is a mystery, but it is a mystery at the core of our being. Without consciousness, then literally nothing matters. There is no sense of being you and so no sense of experience. Yet it is unclear what consciousness actually is. Is there a single self over time? How and where does it exist? Does consciousness mean *self* consciousness? What has consciousness? Animals? Simple organisms? What about future machines? 

This book looks at consciousness from a neuroscience perspective, aiming to explain how subjective experience can be explained in terms of biological and physical processes in brains and bodies. It aims to explain how the properties of consciousness relate to our brain. It does not aim to explain the full functionality of the brain or why consciousness exists in any cosmic sense. 

Consciousness, in the author's view, is less about intelligence and more about being alive, the experience of being a self as a deeply embodied biological process. Conscious experiences are a form of brain-based prediction, "controlled hallucinations" that arise through and because of our living bodies. Our conscious experience doesn't make us separate from nature. They are a part of nature, just as our body is.
> [!quote] In my view, consciousness has more to do with being alive than with being intelligent. We are conscious selves precisely because we are beast machines. I will make the case that the experiences of being you, or of being me, emerge from the way the brain predicts and controls the internal state of the body. The essence of selfhood is neither a rational mind nor an immaterial soul. It is a deeply embodied biological process, a process that underpins the simple feeling of being alive that is the basis for all our experiences of self, indeed for any conscious experience at all. Being you is literally about your body. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08W2J9WWD&location=141))

### 1: LEVEL

#### 1. The Real Problem
Consciousness is, despite the occasional philosophical claim to the contrary, undeniable. It is like something to be you, in a way that it is hard to imagine of a blade of grass. Consciousness requires an organism to have some kind of phenomenology about itself, of any kind. This sense of experience is what distinguishes the phenomenology of consciousness from the functional or behavioral properties, the things that can be observed from the outside. 

This chapter describes the "real" problem of consciousness, as contrasted to the "hard" problem. The hard problem focuses on how and why subjective experience arises from physical processes in the brain. There are various philosophical responses to the hard problem. The author starts from a position of functionally agnostic physicalism, not because it's provably right but because it's most useful for advancing a science of consciousness. 
- physicalism (aka materialism): conscious states are either identical with or emerge from the physical stuff of the universe
    - functionalism: a type of physicalism that says only the function of a system, its transformation of inputs to outputs, matters. Importantly, not all physicalism is functionalism. Functionalism is a key assumption of the idea that computers can simulate consciousness.
- idealism: consciousness is the ultimate source of reality and matter emerges from it
- dualism: consciousness and physical matter are separate substances which somehow interact 
- panpsychism: consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, present in everything
- mysterianism: there may be a physical explanation for consciousness, but we can never understand it

The author discredits the zombie thought experiment, a common critique of physicalism. The thought experiment is that if we can conceive of a philosophical zombie who acts indistinguishable from a conscious being but doesn't experience consciousness, then physicalism cannot explain consciousness. However, like all conceivability arguments, it fails to acknowledge that being able to conceive of something does not make it possible. As the rest of this book will show, there is good reason to believe that consciousness arises from the type of mental processes that lead to doing conscious-like things. 

This brings us to the "real" problem of consciousness. As opposed to the hard problem, the real problem states that the goals of consciousness science are to explain, predict, and control the phenomenological properties of conscious experience. The goal is to explain why a particular conscious experience is the way it is in terms of physical mechanisms and processes in the brain and body. These explanations allow us to predict and control such experiences. This approach allows scientists to break down the problem of consciousness into smaller pieces and go at the hard problem indirectly instead of trying to find one overarching explanation for everything. 

Part, but not all, of this approach to studying consciousness is looking at neural correlates of consciousness, the neuronal mechanisms that are associated with a phenomenological experience. These are valuable, but they do not solve the problem of consciousness on their own. They provide correlations, not explanations. The real problem approach builds on top of these correlations and adds explanatory bridges from the physical to the phenomenological. 

The author makes an analogy to the study of life. Life was too large and ambiguous of a problem, and many thought that science would never be able to explain it. There is still much that is not understood about life, but by breaking it down into smaller pieces and explaining, predicting, and controlling the individual pieces, many of the mysterious of what makes something alive are now well understood (Pieces such as reproduction, metabolism, growth, self-repair, development, homeostatic self-regulation.) Being alive is no longer a single all-or-nothing property. Consciousness, the author believes, is similarly amenable to being broken down. 

Consciousness can be looked at from the point of view of level, content, and self. Level is how conscious we are, Content is what we are conscious of. Self is the experience of being you. These factors are not independent, but they are separable phenomena that can break down the problem of consciousness into pieces more amenable to study. 

#### 2. Measuring Consciousness
Even as an individual, we can tell that not all degrees of consciousness are the same. When we extend that to others, especially non-human others, it becomes apparent that consciousness is not a binary, it is a matter of degree. Thus, there have been various attempts made to measure levels of consciousness. 

To a large degree, consciousness and level of wakefulness (arousal) are correlated. However, we cannot use arousal as a measure of consciousness. There are both low wakefulness states of high consciousness — REM sleep — and low consciousness wakeful states — being in a vegetative state. We need to look at what underlies consciousness, and this seems to depend on how different parts of the brain speak to each other.

A key element of consciousness seems to be that it is integrated. During the conscious state, brain activity seems to "echo" along the cortical surface in complex patterns. There is communication going on within the brain. Measuring this integration is not just philosophical. It has practical implications in being able to detect consciousness when all other measures of conscious activity are inaccessible (such as when someone is "locked in" and cannot communicate in any way).  

When we think about level of consciousness, we must be sure to avoid the error that consciousness that diverges from the healthy adult human is lesser or lower. Conscious experience likely arises in many ways and while it can exist in differing degrees, that is not a moral judgment.

Psychedelics can demonstrate how conscious content can dramatically depart from normal conscious experience and sense of self. These states can have a very high level of algorithmic complexity, which implies a higher level of consciousness. However, they are also associated with dissolved sense of self. More complexity doesn't necessarily mean more conscousness of the self. What this tells us is that complexity is more about a balance of order and disorder, not an extreme of one or the other. 

More formally, conscious experiences are both *informative* and *integrated*. These experiences have information content and are different than any other conscious experience. The experience we have is only one of many we could have, and that experience reduces uncertainty with respect to the range of possible experiences we could be having at any given time. It is also integrated, which roughly means that it appears as a unified scene. Hypothetically, these are not correlates of consciousness but rather that integration and information are the key properties of the underlying neural mechanisms of consciousness.  

The balance between information (which is maximized at randomness) and the structure of integration is what maximizes complexity. Go too far one way or the other, and complexity decreases. A fit-for-purpose measure of consciousness should track both of these. That said, it's still unclear whether or not informativeness and integration *are* consciousness or are ways to measure consciousness. 

#### 3. Phi
The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) is an ambitious attempt to tackle the hard problem of consciousness by saying that information is a real property of the universe and directly leads to subjective experience. Consciousness *is* integrated information, in this theory. Yet this is a theory that is difficult to prove directly since most of its claims are untestable. 

IIT proposes a measure called φ, which is meant to be a measure of how much information the system generates as a whole over what the parts generate independently. The theory claims that this excess is, itself, consciousness. φ will be high when information content is high and dividing up the system reduces the total amount of information. Low information or low integration both lead to low φ. There is a fairly technical discussion about why φ is hard to measure, largely because it describes intrinsic states, not extrinsic, observer-relative states. It also describes some of the odd consequences of IIT.

Overall, this chapter felt like a bit of a distraction. φ and IIT were interesting, but it felt like it could have been a section of the previous chapter, about measures of consciousness, rather than a chapter in its own right. I suspect that the target audience of this chapter was other consciousness researchers. 

### II: CONTENT

#### 4. Perceiving from the Inside Out
The contents of consciousness are what we are conscious of when we are having a conscious experience. The part of the book argues convincingly that we do not perceive reality directly. Rather, the brain is a "prediction machine" constantly making guessing about the state of the world based o the sensory inputs it receives. Consciousness is a controlled hallucination which is both more and less than what the world really is. 

A traditional view of the senses is that they are like windows onto the world. When we see, we are seeing what is really there. However, what neuroscience has found is that what is see is strongly mediated by what we expect to see.The top-down expectations of our mind control how we interpret sensory signals, especially when it comes to higher level concepts. The world exists behind a sensory veil. 

That does not mean our perception is false. Our perceptual judgments are continually being updated as new sensory data arrives. Our predictions are constantly being updated and error checked based on the signals we receive. We can think of this as the contents of consciousness being controlled hallucinations. Our minds only ever contain interpretations, not direct sensory experiences, but those interpretations are controlled by the sensory experiences that generate them. 

The consequences of this are interesting. For example, it means that a certain conscious experience, like the color red isn't perceiving some essence of redness "out there". Instead, color is device that evolution has hit upon to keep track of objects under different lighting conditions. This is why we can perceive something as red even under lighting conditions where the raw sensory signal is quite distinct. 

The role of expectations in perception is the source of many optical illusions such as "the dress" and Adelson's Checkerboard. A bottom up view of perception might consider our susceptibility to these sorts of illusions a flaw, but it's actually a benefit. The purpose of perception, color perception in these examples, is to figure out the most likely cause of sensory signals, not to deliver raw data. 

On the flip side, knowledge can make us more able to perceive accurately. Often times, our visual system can fail to parse an image, but once we know what it is, we have no trouble picking out the image and its details. 

Perception is a generative, creative, proactive, context-laden engagement with sensory signals. These brain based predictions apply to all of our sensory inputs, all of the time. We live in a controlled hallucination whose evolved purpose is to increase our chance of survival. 

This might make it seem like we can never perceive anything new. How can we see something we've never seen before if perception is top down? However, what we find is that experiences are layered, so even if we have never seen, e.g., a gorilla, we see arms, legs, fur, movement and can put that together into a prediction that we can then label. 

#### 5. The Wizard of Odds
If perception and consciousness are top down controlled hallucinations, how do we infer the best interpretation of the sensory input we are getting? We use abductive reasoning to reason backwards from observed effects to their most likely causes (unlike deduction and induction which go from cause to effect).  (And, as always, a good review: abductive reasoning is reasoning by inference, finding the best explanation for a set of observations. Deductive reasoning reaches conclusions by logic alone. Inductive reasoning involves extrapolating from a series of observations.)

We can do this by having prior probabilities for our beliefs which are updated as we gather more data: how often has X occurred in our observations. This is Bayesian inference. We combine priors with likelihoods, which reason from cause to affect: given X, what is the probability of Y? 

What Bayesian reasoning does is update our best guesses based on new data but in a way that takes the reliability of information into account. Information that is more reliable has a larger influence than information that is unreliable. Do this repeatedly, and the prior probabilities will get more accurate over time. 

In the brain, likelihoods map from potential causes to the sensory signals associated with those causes. These can span different scales of time and space. Priors are based on our experience. The brain is constantly updating new best guesses. 

But how does the brain do this in practice? We aren't sitting around doing explicit mathematical computations. Instead, the brain aims to minimize prediction error. By constantly aiming to minimize prediction errors, the brain approximates Bayes' rule. It does this through generative models, perceptual hierarchies, and the "precision weighting" of sensory signals.

Generative models define what you can perceive. These provide perceptual predictions which are compared against sensory data to form prediction errors which trigger updated predictions. These predictions happen at multiple levels, from the broad "there's a gorilla" to the narrow "there are 4 limbs". These perceptual hierarchies link predictions across multiple levels, e.g., if I am in a zoom, my perceptual predictions will differ from if I am at the grocery store. 

Precision weighting is the way that the estimated precision of sensory signals is used to determine the weight of the sensory signal in predictions. The precision itself is inferred because the brain does not have access to the true underlying precision. We can manually adjust the precision weighting of signals in some circumstances by focusing our attention. 

What this all adds up to is a world where action is inseparable from perception. It does not follow perception; perception is not the input with action as the output. They determine each other. Action alters perception and perception alters action. Both are Bayesian predictions about the world based on our sensory data. 

Whether or not that's literally true, it does seem to be the case that active inference, taking action to minimize prediction error, is a key part of how brains make predictions about the world. Active inference is a kind of self-fulfilling perceptual prediction. Because we can generate the consequences of actions we can make predictions and then take actions to make those predictions come true. 

#### 6. The Beholder's Share
The beholder's share is an idea from art that the observer plays a role in "completing" a piece of art with their imagination. The observer contributes their perceptual experience, which is something that goes beyond the art itself. We can extend this idea beyond art. What we experience of the world is not a passive objective reality. It's a vivid and present projection created by the brain reaching out to the world. Less poetically, neuroscientists have been able to show that we are more effective at perceiving what we expect to see. 

This sense that the world is constructed can be seen more directly, although temporarily, though the effects of drugs like LSD. But we also have more every day, mundane hallucinations. Humans, in particular, are predisposed to see faces in pretty much everything. This thin veil between controlled hallucinations and full out hallucinations makes it feasible to use AR and VR to study hallucinations and perception. 

What, then, makes the difference between controlled hallucinations and full out hallucinations. Largely, it's the predictive power of the explanations our brains are constantly generating. For example, we tend to perceive things as objects if our perception of them goes beyond the visual field we see and infer other properties, such as a back or our ability to manipulate it. Thus, our predictions are tied intimately both to the sense data we receive as well as our predictions of what else objects are like. The richer these predictions are, the stronger we perceive the objecthood of that which we are perceiving. 

We don't actually perceive objects; we infer them. Our relationship to change is similar. We don't directly perceive change based on changing sensory data. We perceive change based on our guesses of the world's behavior. Our attention can change what we perceive, and we can ignore extensive changes to our sensory input (change blindness). This may seem problematic until we remember that the purpose of perception is to create useful predictions based on sensory data, not to be a transparent reflection of sensory data. 

One area where we are particularly inconsistent in our perceptions is time. Our inconsistent perception of time, sometimes speeding by and sometimes crawling along, is best understood if we realize that our sense of time is also a controlled hallucination. For time, some scientists believe that the signals that are used for minimizing sensory prediction errors are based on the rate of change of perceptual contents, e.g., when we are subject to more visual change, we will perceive time as moving faster. There does not seem t be any sense in which we have an inner clock ticking away the seconds. 

We can also look into our sense of what is or is not real. When we look at the world, it seems to be really existing. It doesn't feel like a hallucination. How does this sense of realness arise. Traditionally, this sense of realness is ascribed to our perceptions arising from reality itself. However, a better explanation seems to be that our sense of what is real comes from our predictions of causality. The more our sensory inputs align with those predictions, the more real the experience feels. And our predictions come from not the world as is but rather from what is useful for our continued survival. One consequence of this is that a feeling a realness arises because it's valuable in guiding our behavior to differentiate internally and externally oriented sensory predictions. 

Once we have this model of the world, the hard problem becomes less of a problem. If we don't assume that what we perceive is a true reflection of what is out there, then we don't have to work so hard to understand how what is "out there" gets to be "in here". Instead, what is in here is a generative model, a set of predictions. They must have some level of accuracy because they are good enough to keep us alive, but they are not reality itself.

### III: SELF

#### 7. Delirium
An individual's perception can change completely under delirium. Delirium, unlike dementia, is a temporary state. In a state of delirium, not only does perception change, but so does the individual's sense of self. As the author put it relative to his personal experience, "This is not my mother. This is a woman who looks like my mother, but who is not my mother." The relative ease with which delirium can change our self of self highlights a key question this book has been working toward: What is a self? 
#### 8. Expect Yourself
The self *seems* like the thing that does the perceiving, the thing that gathers the sensory inputs and makes the predictions that lead to the controlled hallucinations that mediate our experience with the world. 

Yet this is not the case. .The self itself is another perception, although one that differs from others we experience. The sense of self has many aspects, a sense of personal identity, a sense of having a body, a sense of *being* a body. These senses of self are yet another set of best guesses aimed toward keeping you alive. 

This means that there is not some abstract kernel of your true self that exists independently of the operations of your brain. Yet it *feels* like we have an actual individual, immutable, transcendental self that is more than a collection of perceptions. This has caused many philosophical challenges over the year. Yet if we take the sense of self as a perception rather than as a reality that needs to be explained, many of these challenges dissolve. For example, you don't have to explain whether or how a self can be duplicated if the self is not a separate thing. 

The sense of being a self has multiple components which, in everyday experience, are all bound together: 
- being a body, the feeling of being alive
- having a first-person perspective, an origin of perception, the perspectival self
- having a sense of intention, a sense of free will, the volitional self
- a sense of personal identity and history, a sense of past and future, the narrative self
- how I perceive others perceiving me, the social self

Yet despite seeming bound together, these different senses of self can become disconnect. The narrative self can be warped by delirium or disappear in dementia. The volitional self can be lost in schizophrenia. Out of body experiences show that we can become disconnected from our first person perspective. 
> The self is not an immutable entity that lurks behind the windows of the eyes, looking out into the world and controlling the body as a pilot controls a plane. The experience of being me, or of being you, is a perception itself-or, better, a collection of perceptions a tightly woven bundle of neurally encoded predictions geared toward keeping your body alive. And this, I believe, is all we need to be, to be who we are. (Pg 160)

Experiences of body ownership arise from coordinated sensory experiences, for example, the rubber hand illusion where a combination of seeing and feeling can give you a sense of ownership over a rubber hand. VR has also been used to create experiences which seem to defy our sense of body ownership, showing that this phenomenon is easy to work around. 

The narrative is perceived as a higher level of selfhood than others, and this is the sense of self which most animals (and human infants seem to lack). When is is taken away, such as via dementia, it feels like a core part of our humanity is removed. Our social selves are just as critical out our sense of self. We effortlessly generate complex models of how others see us and this influences our sense of who we are. It is hard to imagine a robust sense of self that exists in isolation from other minds. 

Part of what makes the sense of self valuable is that it creates a sense of stability. Part of what makes a sense of self distinct is that we perceive ourselves as being continuous and unified across time. This is despite that fact that we are constantly changing. To some degree, this is change blindness. However, the sense of a constant self also has evolutionary purpose. 

#### 9. Being a Beast Machine
Self-perception's purpose is physiological control and regulation which helps us stay alive. Our conscious experiences of the world happen with, through, and because our living bodies. It is our bodies which give us a sense of self. 

Beneath any explicit sense of self, there are layers of self which are tied to our emotional and physical experiences. The common factor of these experiences is that they are sensory data that comes from within the body rather than from the external world. 

Our bodily state is at the bottom of everything, with some arguing that our emotions arise from our physiological reactions rather than our reactions (such as crying) arising from our emotions. This does not mean that every emotion has a distinct body state. Rather, our emotions arise from our contextual interpretations of a physical state, e.g., the similarity between fear and excitement. Emotions exist because we don't have direct access to our physiological state. They are the controlled hallucinations for our internal sensory perceptions. 

But what are these perceptions of bodily experience for? Why do we need to know our internal state? For control and regulation. By perceiving our internal state, we can take actions to keep them within a desirable range. This is a form of active inference where we minimize sensory predictions by taking action rather than merely by updating our predictions. Emotions and moods are control-oriented perceptions which regulate the body's essentially variables. 

This mode of perception is, ultimately, more important than understanding what is out there. It's much more important to understand what to do about it. For example, to catch a ball, it matters less where it *is* and more where it *will be*. 

Below emotions and moods, there a grounding yet hard to define sense of being a living organism. This sense seems to arise from a core definitional aspect of being alive. Being alive requires a certain amount of stability through change, allostasis. Our sense of self arises from the self-fulfilling property of trying to keep our body is a dynamically stable state. 
> The experience of the bodily self as being relatively unchanging therefore stems directly from the need to have precise priors—strong predictions—about stable bodily states, for the purposes of physiological regulation. To put it another way: for as long as we live, the brain will never update its prior belief of expecting to be alive. 

And this self-fulfilling prophecy may apply to the seeming stability of other layers of self too. We can maintain our physiological and psychological identity better at every level if we perceive it as stable and control for stability. Self perception is deeply part of the physiology of living. 

#### 10. A Fish in Water
This chapter contains an exploration of the free energy principle and how it impacts definitions of life and consciousness. My key takeaway is that being alive means being in and maintaining a state of low entropy. All objects, almost by definition, exist in a state of relatively low entropy. That's why we perceive them as *things*. Yet going beyond that to maintenance of that low entropy state is what distinguishes something living from something which is not. 
> For any living system, the condition of "being alive" means proactively seeking out a particular set of states that are visited repeatedly over time

####  11. Degrees of Freedom
The aspect of selfhood that many people cling to most closely is a sense of being in control of their own actions. We have an inescapable sense that we do have free will, no matter what the philosophers tell us. However, this sense of volition does not require a separate conscious self that is pulling the material strings. Rather, a sense of control is another constructed perception that plays an important role in guiding our actions. 

What experiments have shown is that the early signals of our actions arise before our conscious perception of them. Our sense of volition is the conscious *outcome* of a set of processes that encompass much more than our conscious mind. This does not mean that it's *random* but it does mean that our conscious thoughts do not provide control. 

Voluntary actions seem voluntary because they express what we want, we feel like we could have done otherwise, and they feel like they come from within. Yet these do not reflect underlying reality with respect to conscious thought. However, they are closer to true when we take the control perspective. Altogether, our mental and physiological processes allow us to control our actions in ways that are aligned with the degrees of freedom our system of self-regulation can encompass. This includes underlying sensory and emotional states but also includes beliefs, values, and goals that are not part of the immediate environment and bodily state. 

We can look at volition as a set of processes determining "what", "when", and "whether" we take an action. "What" integrates beliefs, goals, and value with environmental perceptions. "When" is associated with the urge to actually do something, like move. And "whether" allows us to cancel something at the last moment. This loop of "what", "when", and "whether" is continually playing out in the brain. In that sense, volition is not a matter of willing an action. It's a continuous flow of voluntary actions (and their inhibition) which we sometimes perceive more clearly than at other times. (E.g., when we are in flow, we *don't* perceive our activities as willed.)

Our experience of volition is important because even though by the time we are aware of a volitional action, it has generally already occurred, our volitional choices provide useful guidance for future behavior. By being aware of what we intended to do, we can repeat or modify that action in the future. Thus, the sense that we could have taken a different action than we does not indicate that we actually could have done differently then. However, it does indicate that we can do differently in the future. 

Add this all together, and volition is real, in the same sense that "redness" is real. It doesn't correspond to a definite property of the world. However, it is as real as any other conscious perception in that it provides a perceptual best guess of underlying reality to guide future behavior. And they are essential to our survival. Without them, we could not survive, and that makes them incredibly real. 

### IV: OTHER

####  12. Beyond Human
Animals are conscious, although not in the same way as human (or each other). When we dissociate consciousness from intelligence, it becomes obvious that the same mechanisms of prediction and control which give rise to the different aspects of conscious in humans apply just as well to animals. 

We can expect that animals will have different levels and content of consciousness. This follows naturally from their different sensory inputs and processing capacity. For example, different animals seem to have different levels of capability for recognizing themselves, with only a few mammals able to do so — some great apes, a few dolphins and killer whales, and a single elephant (although this could be because they perceive the world so differently). 

Octopuses are an example of a creature who has high levels of intelligence and seems to have a fairly high level of consciousness. Yet they are so different from mammals that it's almost certain that their experience of consciousness is dramatically different from that of humans. 

Thus, if we want to align our decisions about animal welfare on consciousness, we can't look at similarity to humans. Instead, we should look at the underlying factors of consciousness such as the degree to which they maintain their basic physiological integrity. Yet there are no guarantees here. It seems likely that some insects don't experience consciousness, at least to any substantial degree and that most more complex animals do. But without being in the mind of another we can never know. 

####  13. Machine Minds
Animals show that consciousness can exist without intelligence. Today's AI shows that intelligence can exist without consciousness. (Although when we confuse intelligence with consciousness, we may become too eager to attribute consciousness to that which does not show the elements of it.) Seth takes the position that machines *can't* be conscious. What he argues successfully against is functionalism, the idea that what matters for consciousness is what a system does rather than some internal perception. 

Functionalism consists of two separate claims. First that consciousness is independent of the material substrate. Second is whether or not the input/output relationships of information processing are sufficient to explain consciousness. 

Much of today's AI is machine based pattern recognition and does not meet the bar of consciousness. Making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient. A more interesting question to explore is whether or not machine consciousness is possible.

Functionalists tend to believe that the answer is a clear yes: there is nothing to prevent machines from having the information processing characteristics of consciousness and if information processing *is* consciousness, then these machines will be conscious. 

The beast machine theory explored in this book, the idea that consciousness is an outcrop of the biological drive to stay alive, gives a different perspective. A conscious machine would, at the very least, need to have an maintain some sort of sensory experience. Seth believes that even if a robot were to behave this way, it would not be conscious. Seth's intuition is that life will end up being a necessity for consciousness. In particular, the aspect of life that is relevant is the hierarchical self maintenance of systems, from the whole organism down to the individual cells. My personal intuition is that if consciousness exists in degrees rather than being a binary, I lean toward expecting that machines could show consciousness if they are made sufficiently able and inclined to maintain their integrity. 

Seth also discussions the distinction between machines that have consciousness and machines that are sufficiently advanced to make us think they have consciousness. It seems inevitable that machines in the second category — machines that make us believe that have consciousness, at least given sufficiently small sample sizes of interactions — will start to exist. The psychological and behavioral consequences of this are profound even if you believe these machines don't have consciousness. Because how we treat them says more about us than it says about them.

And once something is conscious, it has a moral status, so even if we think the possibility is slim, it has ethical ramifications that we must consider.
> In my theory, as we've seen, the entirety of human experience and mental life arises because of, and not in spite of, our nature as self-sustaining biological organisms that care about their own persistence. This view of consciousness and human nature does not exclude the possibility of conscious machines, but it does undercut the amped-up techno-rapture narrative of soon-to-be-sentient computers that propels our fears and permeates our dreams. From the beast machine perspective, the quest to understand consciousness places us increasingly within nature, not further apart from it.
> 
> Just as it should.

### Assistant - 2024-08-27 13:41:57

Based on your notes, here’s a list of what you personally considered most relevant and resonant from Anil Seth's _Being You_:

1. **Consciousness and Being Alive**:
   - The idea that consciousness is more about being alive than being intelligent, with conscious experiences arising as brain-based predictions and "controlled hallucinations" grounded in our biological processes.

2. **The Real Problem of Consciousness**:
   - The emphasis on explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomenological properties of consciousness, as opposed to solving the "hard" problem of why subjective experience arises from physical processes.

3. **Perception as Controlled Hallucination**:
   - The notion that perception is a top-down process, heavily influenced by expectations, and that we never perceive reality directly but through a controlled hallucination created by the brain.

4. **Self as a Perception**:
   - The concept that the self is not a fixed, immutable entity but a perception, composed of various aspects like body ownership, personal identity, and social self, all aimed at survival and stability.

5. **Emotions and the Bodily Self**:
   - The idea that emotions are controlled hallucinations of internal sensory perceptions, serving to regulate the body's essential variables, with a deep connection between the sense of self and bodily states.

6. **The Role of Active Inference**:
   - The understanding that action is inseparable from perception, with both being forms of Bayesian predictions about the world, leading to the concept of active inference where actions minimize prediction errors.

7. **Volition and Free Will**:
   - The exploration of volition as a constructed perception, where conscious experiences of volition are real in guiding future behavior but do not correspond to a separate conscious self exerting control.

8. **The Ethical Implications of Consciousness**:
   - The recognition of the ethical ramifications of consciousness, particularly in animals and the potential for machine consciousness, emphasizing the importance of understanding consciousness within a biological framework.

9. **Consciousness Beyond Humans**:
   - The acknowledgment that consciousness exists in animals, though in different forms and levels, and the necessity of considering underlying factors of consciousness rather than human-like traits when discussing animal welfare.

These points reflect your engagement with the concepts that explore the biological, perceptual, and ethical dimensions of consciousness, as well as the implications for self-perception and the potential for machine consciousness.

Given my book review style, the key points which stuck out to me, and the notes below (which are the same as the notes above), write a 5-10 paragraph book review and summary which reflects my style and reflects my value-add thoughts on the book.

Notes:
#### Prologue

There is nothing that it's *like* to be under general anesthesia. One is just not there, in a way that goes beyond the absence of sleep. What this highlights is that under normal conditions, there is a sense of being there, of experiencing life in the first person, of *being you*.  

Consciousness is a mystery, but it is a mystery at the core of our being. Without consciousness, then literally nothing matters. There is no sense of being you and so no sense of experience. Yet it is unclear what consciousness actually is. Is there a single self over time? How and where does it exist? Does consciousness mean *self* consciousness? What has consciousness? Animals? Simple organisms? What about future machines? 

This book looks at consciousness from a neuroscience perspective, aiming to explain how subjective experience can be explained in terms of biological and physical processes in brains and bodies. It aims to explain how the properties of consciousness relate to our brain. It does not aim to explain the full functionality of the brain or why consciousness exists in any cosmic sense. 

Consciousness, in the author's view, is less about intelligence and more about being alive, the experience of being a self as a deeply embodied biological process. Conscious experiences are a form of brain-based prediction, "controlled hallucinations" that arise through and because of our living bodies. Our conscious experience doesn't make us separate from nature. They are a part of nature, just as our body is.
> [!quote] In my view, consciousness has more to do with being alive than with being intelligent. We are conscious selves precisely because we are beast machines. I will make the case that the experiences of being you, or of being me, emerge from the way the brain predicts and controls the internal state of the body. The essence of selfhood is neither a rational mind nor an immaterial soul. It is a deeply embodied biological process, a process that underpins the simple feeling of being alive that is the basis for all our experiences of self, indeed for any conscious experience at all. Being you is literally about your body. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08W2J9WWD&location=141))

### 1: LEVEL

#### 1. The Real Problem
Consciousness is, despite the occasional philosophical claim to the contrary, undeniable. It is like something to be you, in a way that it is hard to imagine of a blade of grass. Consciousness requires an organism to have some kind of phenomenology about itself, of any kind. This sense of experience is what distinguishes the phenomenology of consciousness from the functional or behavioral properties, the things that can be observed from the outside. 

This chapter describes the "real" problem of consciousness, as contrasted to the "hard" problem. The hard problem focuses on how and why subjective experience arises from physical processes in the brain. There are various philosophical responses to the hard problem. The author starts from a position of functionally agnostic physicalism, not because it's provably right but because it's most useful for advancing a science of consciousness. 
- physicalism (aka materialism): conscious states are either identical with or emerge from the physical stuff of the universe
    - functionalism: a type of physicalism that says only the function of a system, its transformation of inputs to outputs, matters. Importantly, not all physicalism is functionalism. Functionalism is a key assumption of the idea that computers can simulate consciousness.
- idealism: consciousness is the ultimate source of reality and matter emerges from it
- dualism: consciousness and physical matter are separate substances which somehow interact 
- panpsychism: consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, present in everything
- mysterianism: there may be a physical explanation for consciousness, but we can never understand it

The author discredits the zombie thought experiment, a common critique of physicalism. The thought experiment is that if we can conceive of a philosophical zombie who acts indistinguishable from a conscious being but doesn't experience consciousness, then physicalism cannot explain consciousness. However, like all conceivability arguments, it fails to acknowledge that being able to conceive of something does not make it possible. As the rest of this book will show, there is good reason to believe that consciousness arises from the type of mental processes that lead to doing conscious-like things. 

This brings us to the "real" problem of consciousness. As opposed to the hard problem, the real problem states that the goals of consciousness science are to explain, predict, and control the phenomenological properties of conscious experience. The goal is to explain why a particular conscious experience is the way it is in terms of physical mechanisms and processes in the brain and body. These explanations allow us to predict and control such experiences. This approach allows scientists to break down the problem of consciousness into smaller pieces and go at the hard problem indirectly instead of trying to find one overarching explanation for everything. 

Part, but not all, of this approach to studying consciousness is looking at neural correlates of consciousness, the neuronal mechanisms that are associated with a phenomenological experience. These are valuable, but they do not solve the problem of consciousness on their own. They provide correlations, not explanations. The real problem approach builds on top of these correlations and adds explanatory bridges from the physical to the phenomenological. 

The author makes an analogy to the study of life. Life was too large and ambiguous of a problem, and many thought that science would never be able to explain it. There is still much that is not understood about life, but by breaking it down into smaller pieces and explaining, predicting, and controlling the individual pieces, many of the mysterious of what makes something alive are now well understood (Pieces such as reproduction, metabolism, growth, self-repair, development, homeostatic self-regulation.) Being alive is no longer a single all-or-nothing property. Consciousness, the author believes, is similarly amenable to being broken down. 

Consciousness can be looked at from the point of view of level, content, and self. Level is how conscious we are, Content is what we are conscious of. Self is the experience of being you. These factors are not independent, but they are separable phenomena that can break down the problem of consciousness into pieces more amenable to study. 

#### 2. Measuring Consciousness
Even as an individual, we can tell that not all degrees of consciousness are the same. When we extend that to others, especially non-human others, it becomes apparent that consciousness is not a binary, it is a matter of degree. Thus, there have been various attempts made to measure levels of consciousness. 

To a large degree, consciousness and level of wakefulness (arousal) are correlated. However, we cannot use arousal as a measure of consciousness. There are both low wakefulness states of high consciousness — REM sleep — and low consciousness wakeful states — being in a vegetative state. We need to look at what underlies consciousness, and this seems to depend on how different parts of the brain speak to each other.

A key element of consciousness seems to be that it is integrated. During the conscious state, brain activity seems to "echo" along the cortical surface in complex patterns. There is communication going on within the brain. Measuring this integration is not just philosophical. It has practical implications in being able to detect consciousness when all other measures of conscious activity are inaccessible (such as when someone is "locked in" and cannot communicate in any way).  

When we think about level of consciousness, we must be sure to avoid the error that consciousness that diverges from the healthy adult human is lesser or lower. Conscious experience likely arises in many ways and while it can exist in differing degrees, that is not a moral judgment.

Psychedelics can demonstrate how conscious content can dramatically depart from normal conscious experience and sense of self. These states can have a very high level of algorithmic complexity, which implies a higher level of consciousness. However, they are also associated with dissolved sense of self. More complexity doesn't necessarily mean more conscousness of the self. What this tells us is that complexity is more about a balance of order and disorder, not an extreme of one or the other. 

More formally, conscious experiences are both *informative* and *integrated*. These experiences have information content and are different than any other conscious experience. The experience we have is only one of many we could have, and that experience reduces uncertainty with respect to the range of possible experiences we could be having at any given time. It is also integrated, which roughly means that it appears as a unified scene. Hypothetically, these are not correlates of consciousness but rather that integration and information are the key properties of the underlying neural mechanisms of consciousness.  

The balance between information (which is maximized at randomness) and the structure of integration is what maximizes complexity. Go too far one way or the other, and complexity decreases. A fit-for-purpose measure of consciousness should track both of these. That said, it's still unclear whether or not informativeness and integration *are* consciousness or are ways to measure consciousness. 

#### 3. Phi
The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) is an ambitious attempt to tackle the hard problem of consciousness by saying that information is a real property of the universe and directly leads to subjective experience. Consciousness *is* integrated information, in this theory. Yet this is a theory that is difficult to prove directly since most of its claims are untestable. 

IIT proposes a measure called φ, which is meant to be a measure of how much information the system generates as a whole over what the parts generate independently. The theory claims that this excess is, itself, consciousness. φ will be high when information content is high and dividing up the system reduces the total amount of information. Low information or low integration both lead to low φ. There is a fairly technical discussion about why φ is hard to measure, largely because it describes intrinsic states, not extrinsic, observer-relative states. It also describes some of the odd consequences of IIT.

Overall, this chapter felt like a bit of a distraction. φ and IIT were interesting, but it felt like it could have been a section of the previous chapter, about measures of consciousness, rather than a chapter in its own right. I suspect that the target audience of this chapter was other consciousness researchers. 

### II: CONTENT

#### 4. Perceiving from the Inside Out
The contents of consciousness are what we are conscious of when we are having a conscious experience. The part of the book argues convincingly that we do not perceive reality directly. Rather, the brain is a "prediction machine" constantly making guessing about the state of the world based o the sensory inputs it receives. Consciousness is a controlled hallucination which is both more and less than what the world really is. 

A traditional view of the senses is that they are like windows onto the world. When we see, we are seeing what is really there. However, what neuroscience has found is that what is see is strongly mediated by what we expect to see.The top-down expectations of our mind control how we interpret sensory signals, especially when it comes to higher level concepts. The world exists behind a sensory veil. 

That does not mean our perception is false. Our perceptual judgments are continually being updated as new sensory data arrives. Our predictions are constantly being updated and error checked based on the signals we receive. We can think of this as the contents of consciousness being controlled hallucinations. Our minds only ever contain interpretations, not direct sensory experiences, but those interpretations are controlled by the sensory experiences that generate them. 

The consequences of this are interesting. For example, it means that a certain conscious experience, like the color red isn't perceiving some essence of redness "out there". Instead, color is device that evolution has hit upon to keep track of objects under different lighting conditions. This is why we can perceive something as red even under lighting conditions where the raw sensory signal is quite distinct. 

The role of expectations in perception is the source of many optical illusions such as "the dress" and Adelson's Checkerboard. A bottom up view of perception might consider our susceptibility to these sorts of illusions a flaw, but it's actually a benefit. The purpose of perception, color perception in these examples, is to figure out the most likely cause of sensory signals, not to deliver raw data. 

On the flip side, knowledge can make us more able to perceive accurately. Often times, our visual system can fail to parse an image, but once we know what it is, we have no trouble picking out the image and its details. 

Perception is a generative, creative, proactive, context-laden engagement with sensory signals. These brain based predictions apply to all of our sensory inputs, all of the time. We live in a controlled hallucination whose evolved purpose is to increase our chance of survival. 

This might make it seem like we can never perceive anything new. How can we see something we've never seen before if perception is top down? However, what we find is that experiences are layered, so even if we have never seen, e.g., a gorilla, we see arms, legs, fur, movement and can put that together into a prediction that we can then label. 

#### 5. The Wizard of Odds
If perception and consciousness are top down controlled hallucinations, how do we infer the best interpretation of the sensory input we are getting? We use abductive reasoning to reason backwards from observed effects to their most likely causes (unlike deduction and induction which go from cause to effect).  (And, as always, a good review: abductive reasoning is reasoning by inference, finding the best explanation for a set of observations. Deductive reasoning reaches conclusions by logic alone. Inductive reasoning involves extrapolating from a series of observations.)

We can do this by having prior probabilities for our beliefs which are updated as we gather more data: how often has X occurred in our observations. This is Bayesian inference. We combine priors with likelihoods, which reason from cause to affect: given X, what is the probability of Y? 

What Bayesian reasoning does is update our best guesses based on new data but in a way that takes the reliability of information into account. Information that is more reliable has a larger influence than information that is unreliable. Do this repeatedly, and the prior probabilities will get more accurate over time. 

In the brain, likelihoods map from potential causes to the sensory signals associated with those causes. These can span different scales of time and space. Priors are based on our experience. The brain is constantly updating new best guesses. 

But how does the brain do this in practice? We aren't sitting around doing explicit mathematical computations. Instead, the brain aims to minimize prediction error. By constantly aiming to minimize prediction errors, the brain approximates Bayes' rule. It does this through generative models, perceptual hierarchies, and the "precision weighting" of sensory signals.

Generative models define what you can perceive. These provide perceptual predictions which are compared against sensory data to form prediction errors which trigger updated predictions. These predictions happen at multiple levels, from the broad "there's a gorilla" to the narrow "there are 4 limbs". These perceptual hierarchies link predictions across multiple levels, e.g., if I am in a zoom, my perceptual predictions will differ from if I am at the grocery store. 

Precision weighting is the way that the estimated precision of sensory signals is used to determine the weight of the sensory signal in predictions. The precision itself is inferred because the brain does not have access to the true underlying precision. We can manually adjust the precision weighting of signals in some circumstances by focusing our attention. 

What this all adds up to is a world where action is inseparable from perception. It does not follow perception; perception is not the input with action as the output. They determine each other. Action alters perception and perception alters action. Both are Bayesian predictions about the world based on our sensory data. 

Whether or not that's literally true, it does seem to be the case that active inference, taking action to minimize prediction error, is a key part of how brains make predictions about the world. Active inference is a kind of self-fulfilling perceptual prediction. Because we can generate the consequences of actions we can make predictions and then take actions to make those predictions come true. 

#### 6. The Beholder's Share
The beholder's share is an idea from art that the observer plays a role in "completing" a piece of art with their imagination. The observer contributes their perceptual experience, which is something that goes beyond the art itself. We can extend this idea beyond art. What we experience of the world is not a passive objective reality. It's a vivid and present projection created by the brain reaching out to the world. Less poetically, neuroscientists have been able to show that we are more effective at perceiving what we expect to see. 

This sense that the world is constructed can be seen more directly, although temporarily, though the effects of drugs like LSD. But we also have more every day, mundane hallucinations. Humans, in particular, are predisposed to see faces in pretty much everything. This thin veil between controlled hallucinations and full out hallucinations makes it feasible to use AR and VR to study hallucinations and perception. 

What, then, makes the difference between controlled hallucinations and full out hallucinations. Largely, it's the predictive power of the explanations our brains are constantly generating. For example, we tend to perceive things as objects if our perception of them goes beyond the visual field we see and infer other properties, such as a back or our ability to manipulate it. Thus, our predictions are tied intimately both to the sense data we receive as well as our predictions of what else objects are like. The richer these predictions are, the stronger we perceive the objecthood of that which we are perceiving. 

We don't actually perceive objects; we infer them. Our relationship to change is similar. We don't directly perceive change based on changing sensory data. We perceive change based on our guesses of the world's behavior. Our attention can change what we perceive, and we can ignore extensive changes to our sensory input (change blindness). This may seem problematic until we remember that the purpose of perception is to create useful predictions based on sensory data, not to be a transparent reflection of sensory data. 

One area where we are particularly inconsistent in our perceptions is time. Our inconsistent perception of time, sometimes speeding by and sometimes crawling along, is best understood if we realize that our sense of time is also a controlled hallucination. For time, some scientists believe that the signals that are used for minimizing sensory prediction errors are based on the rate of change of perceptual contents, e.g., when we are subject to more visual change, we will perceive time as moving faster. There does not seem t be any sense in which we have an inner clock ticking away the seconds. 

We can also look into our sense of what is or is not real. When we look at the world, it seems to be really existing. It doesn't feel like a hallucination. How does this sense of realness arise. Traditionally, this sense of realness is ascribed to our perceptions arising from reality itself. However, a better explanation seems to be that our sense of what is real comes from our predictions of causality. The more our sensory inputs align with those predictions, the more real the experience feels. And our predictions come from not the world as is but rather from what is useful for our continued survival. One consequence of this is that a feeling a realness arises because it's valuable in guiding our behavior to differentiate internally and externally oriented sensory predictions. 

Once we have this model of the world, the hard problem becomes less of a problem. If we don't assume that what we perceive is a true reflection of what is out there, then we don't have to work so hard to understand how what is "out there" gets to be "in here". Instead, what is in here is a generative model, a set of predictions. They must have some level of accuracy because they are good enough to keep us alive, but they are not reality itself.

### III: SELF

#### 7. Delirium
An individual's perception can change completely under delirium. Delirium, unlike dementia, is a temporary state. In a state of delirium, not only does perception change, but so does the individual's sense of self. As the author put it relative to his personal experience, "This is not my mother. This is a woman who looks like my mother, but who is not my mother." The relative ease with which delirium can change our self of self highlights a key question this book has been working toward: What is a self? 
#### 8. Expect Yourself
The self *seems* like the thing that does the perceiving, the thing that gathers the sensory inputs and makes the predictions that lead to the controlled hallucinations that mediate our experience with the world. 

Yet this is not the case. .The self itself is another perception, although one that differs from others we experience. The sense of self has many aspects, a sense of personal identity, a sense of having a body, a sense of *being* a body. These senses of self are yet another set of best guesses aimed toward keeping you alive. 

This means that there is not some abstract kernel of your true self that exists independently of the operations of your brain. Yet it *feels* like we have an actual individual, immutable, transcendental self that is more than a collection of perceptions. This has caused many philosophical challenges over the year. Yet if we take the sense of self as a perception rather than as a reality that needs to be explained, many of these challenges dissolve. For example, you don't have to explain whether or how a self can be duplicated if the self is not a separate thing. 

The sense of being a self has multiple components which, in everyday experience, are all bound together: 
- being a body, the feeling of being alive
- having a first-person perspective, an origin of perception, the perspectival self
- having a sense of intention, a sense of free will, the volitional self
- a sense of personal identity and history, a sense of past and future, the narrative self
- how I perceive others perceiving me, the social self

Yet despite seeming bound together, these different senses of self can become disconnect. The narrative self can be warped by delirium or disappear in dementia. The volitional self can be lost in schizophrenia. Out of body experiences show that we can become disconnected from our first person perspective. 
> The self is not an immutable entity that lurks behind the windows of the eyes, looking out into the world and controlling the body as a pilot controls a plane. The experience of being me, or of being you, is a perception itself-or, better, a collection of perceptions a tightly woven bundle of neurally encoded predictions geared toward keeping your body alive. And this, I believe, is all we need to be, to be who we are. (Pg 160)

Experiences of body ownership arise from coordinated sensory experiences, for example, the rubber hand illusion where a combination of seeing and feeling can give you a sense of ownership over a rubber hand. VR has also been used to create experiences which seem to defy our sense of body ownership, showing that this phenomenon is easy to work around. 

The narrative is perceived as a higher level of selfhood than others, and this is the sense of self which most animals (and human infants seem to lack). When is is taken away, such as via dementia, it feels like a core part of our humanity is removed. Our social selves are just as critical out our sense of self. We effortlessly generate complex models of how others see us and this influences our sense of who we are. It is hard to imagine a robust sense of self that exists in isolation from other minds. 

Part of what makes the sense of self valuable is that it creates a sense of stability. Part of what makes a sense of self distinct is that we perceive ourselves as being continuous and unified across time. This is despite that fact that we are constantly changing. To some degree, this is change blindness. However, the sense of a constant self also has evolutionary purpose. 

#### 9. Being a Beast Machine
Self-perception's purpose is physiological control and regulation which helps us stay alive. Our conscious experiences of the world happen with, through, and because our living bodies. It is our bodies which give us a sense of self. 

Beneath any explicit sense of self, there are layers of self which are tied to our emotional and physical experiences. The common factor of these experiences is that they are sensory data that comes from within the body rather than from the external world. 

Our bodily state is at the bottom of everything, with some arguing that our emotions arise from our physiological reactions rather than our reactions (such as crying) arising from our emotions. This does not mean that every emotion has a distinct body state. Rather, our emotions arise from our contextual interpretations of a physical state, e.g., the similarity between fear and excitement. Emotions exist because we don't have direct access to our physiological state. They are the controlled hallucinations for our internal sensory perceptions. 

But what are these perceptions of bodily experience for? Why do we need to know our internal state? For control and regulation. By perceiving our internal state, we can take actions to keep them within a desirable range. This is a form of active inference where we minimize sensory predictions by taking action rather than merely by updating our predictions. Emotions and moods are control-oriented perceptions which regulate the body's essentially variables. 

This mode of perception is, ultimately, more important than understanding what is out there. It's much more important to understand what to do about it. For example, to catch a ball, it matters less where it *is* and more where it *will be*. 

Below emotions and moods, there a grounding yet hard to define sense of being a living organism. This sense seems to arise from a core definitional aspect of being alive. Being alive requires a certain amount of stability through change, allostasis. Our sense of self arises from the self-fulfilling property of trying to keep our body is a dynamically stable state. 
> The experience of the bodily self as being relatively unchanging therefore stems directly from the need to have precise priors—strong predictions—about stable bodily states, for the purposes of physiological regulation. To put it another way: for as long as we live, the brain will never update its prior belief of expecting to be alive. 

And this self-fulfilling prophecy may apply to the seeming stability of other layers of self too. We can maintain our physiological and psychological identity better at every level if we perceive it as stable and control for stability. Self perception is deeply part of the physiology of living. 

#### 10. A Fish in Water
This chapter contains an exploration of the free energy principle and how it impacts definitions of life and consciousness. My key takeaway is that being alive means being in and maintaining a state of low entropy. All objects, almost by definition, exist in a state of relatively low entropy. That's why we perceive them as *things*. Yet going beyond that to maintenance of that low entropy state is what distinguishes something living from something which is not. 
> For any living system, the condition of "being alive" means proactively seeking out a particular set of states that are visited repeatedly over time

####  11. Degrees of Freedom
The aspect of selfhood that many people cling to most closely is a sense of being in control of their own actions. We have an inescapable sense that we do have free will, no matter what the philosophers tell us. However, this sense of volition does not require a separate conscious self that is pulling the material strings. Rather, a sense of control is another constructed perception that plays an important role in guiding our actions. 

What experiments have shown is that the early signals of our actions arise before our conscious perception of them. Our sense of volition is the conscious *outcome* of a set of processes that encompass much more than our conscious mind. This does not mean that it's *random* but it does mean that our conscious thoughts do not provide control. 

Voluntary actions seem voluntary because they express what we want, we feel like we could have done otherwise, and they feel like they come from within. Yet these do not reflect underlying reality with respect to conscious thought. However, they are closer to true when we take the control perspective. Altogether, our mental and physiological processes allow us to control our actions in ways that are aligned with the degrees of freedom our system of self-regulation can encompass. This includes underlying sensory and emotional states but also includes beliefs, values, and goals that are not part of the immediate environment and bodily state. 

We can look at volition as a set of processes determining "what", "when", and "whether" we take an action. "What" integrates beliefs, goals, and value with environmental perceptions. "When" is associated with the urge to actually do something, like move. And "whether" allows us to cancel something at the last moment. This loop of "what", "when", and "whether" is continually playing out in the brain. In that sense, volition is not a matter of willing an action. It's a continuous flow of voluntary actions (and their inhibition) which we sometimes perceive more clearly than at other times. (E.g., when we are in flow, we *don't* perceive our activities as willed.)

Our experience of volition is important because even though by the time we are aware of a volitional action, it has generally already occurred, our volitional choices provide useful guidance for future behavior. By being aware of what we intended to do, we can repeat or modify that action in the future. Thus, the sense that we could have taken a different action than we does not indicate that we actually could have done differently then. However, it does indicate that we can do differently in the future. 

Add this all together, and volition is real, in the same sense that "redness" is real. It doesn't correspond to a definite property of the world. However, it is as real as any other conscious perception in that it provides a perceptual best guess of underlying reality to guide future behavior. And they are essential to our survival. Without them, we could not survive, and that makes them incredibly real. 

### IV: OTHER

####  12. Beyond Human
Animals are conscious, although not in the same way as human (or each other). When we dissociate consciousness from intelligence, it becomes obvious that the same mechanisms of prediction and control which give rise to the different aspects of conscious in humans apply just as well to animals. 

We can expect that animals will have different levels and content of consciousness. This follows naturally from their different sensory inputs and processing capacity. For example, different animals seem to have different levels of capability for recognizing themselves, with only a few mammals able to do so — some great apes, a few dolphins and killer whales, and a single elephant (although this could be because they perceive the world so differently). 

Octopuses are an example of a creature who has high levels of intelligence and seems to have a fairly high level of consciousness. Yet they are so different from mammals that it's almost certain that their experience of consciousness is dramatically different from that of humans. 

Thus, if we want to align our decisions about animal welfare on consciousness, we can't look at similarity to humans. Instead, we should look at the underlying factors of consciousness such as the degree to which they maintain their basic physiological integrity. Yet there are no guarantees here. It seems likely that some insects don't experience consciousness, at least to any substantial degree and that most more complex animals do. But without being in the mind of another we can never know. 

####  13. Machine Minds
Animals show that consciousness can exist without intelligence. Today's AI shows that intelligence can exist without consciousness. (Although when we confuse intelligence with consciousness, we may become too eager to attribute consciousness to that which does not show the elements of it.) Seth takes the position that machines *can't* be conscious. What he argues successfully against is functionalism, the idea that what matters for consciousness is what a system does rather than some internal perception. 

Functionalism consists of two separate claims. First that consciousness is independent of the material substrate. Second is whether or not the input/output relationships of information processing are sufficient to explain consciousness. 

Much of today's AI is machine based pattern recognition and does not meet the bar of consciousness. Making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient. A more interesting question to explore is whether or not machine consciousness is possible.

Functionalists tend to believe that the answer is a clear yes: there is nothing to prevent machines from having the information processing characteristics of consciousness and if information processing *is* consciousness, then these machines will be conscious. 

The beast machine theory explored in this book, the idea that consciousness is an outcrop of the biological drive to stay alive, gives a different perspective. A conscious machine would, at the very least, need to have an maintain some sort of sensory experience. Seth believes that even if a robot were to behave this way, it would not be conscious. Seth's intuition is that life will end up being a necessity for consciousness. In particular, the aspect of life that is relevant is the hierarchical self maintenance of systems, from the whole organism down to the individual cells. My personal intuition is that if consciousness exists in degrees rather than being a binary, I lean toward expecting that machines could show consciousness if they are made sufficiently able and inclined to maintain their integrity. 

Seth also discussions the distinction between machines that have consciousness and machines that are sufficiently advanced to make us think they have consciousness. It seems inevitable that machines in the second category — machines that make us believe that have consciousness, at least given sufficiently small sample sizes of interactions — will start to exist. The psychological and behavioral consequences of this are profound even if you believe these machines don't have consciousness. Because how we treat them says more about us than it says about them.

And once something is conscious, it has a moral status, so even if we think the possibility is slim, it has ethical ramifications that we must consider.
> In my theory, as we've seen, the entirety of human experience and mental life arises because of, and not in spite of, our nature as self-sustaining biological organisms that care about their own persistence. This view of consciousness and human nature does not exclude the possibility of conscious machines, but it does undercut the amped-up techno-rapture narrative of soon-to-be-sentient computers that propels our fears and permeates our dreams. From the beast machine perspective, the quest to understand consciousness places us increasingly within nature, not further apart from it.
> 
> Just as it should.

Anil Seth's _Being You_ provides a thought-provoking exploration of consciousness from a neuroscience perspective, challenging long-held beliefs and offering new insights into the nature of self and perception. Seth approaches consciousness not as an abstract philosophical problem but as a tangible, biological process deeply rooted in our bodies and experiences as living organisms. This perspective shifts the conversation from the elusive "hard problem" of consciousness—why subjective experience arises from physical processes—to what he terms the "real problem": explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomenological properties of conscious experience.

One of the book's central ideas is that consciousness is less about intelligence and more about being alive. Seth posits that our conscious experiences are essentially "controlled hallucinations" generated by the brain as it predicts and regulates the body's internal states. This concept of perception as a top-down process, where the brain's expectations shape our sensory experiences, offers a compelling framework for understanding how we interact with the world. It also suggests that what we perceive is not a direct reflection of reality but a generative model constructed by the brain to enhance our survival.

Seth delves into the intricacies of self-perception, arguing that the self is not an immutable entity but a dynamic construct, a collection of perceptions designed to keep the body alive. This view challenges the traditional notion of a singular, unchanging self and instead presents the self as a multi-faceted experience, encompassing bodily awareness, a sense of personal identity, and the social self—how we perceive others perceiving us. The fluidity of the self, as Seth describes it, highlights the adaptability of consciousness, particularly in how different aspects of the self can become disconnected, as seen in conditions like delirium or out-of-body experiences.

The book's exploration of the relationship between perception and action is particularly insightful. Seth introduces the idea of active inference, where perception and action are intertwined, each shaping the other in a continuous feedback loop. This notion aligns with his broader argument that consciousness is not a passive reflection of the world but an active process of prediction and control. The discussion of volition further extends this idea, suggesting that our sense of free will is not an illusion but a real, albeit constructed, perception that guides future behavior.

Seth's treatment of machine consciousness is both cautious and critical. He argues against the functionalist view that consciousness can be reduced to information processing alone, emphasizing instead the importance of life and self-maintenance in the emergence of consciousness. While Seth stops short of entirely dismissing the possibility of conscious machines, he suggests that any such machines would need to embody some form of sensory experience and self-regulation, akin to living organisms. This perspective offers a counterpoint to the more sensational narratives of imminent sentient AI, grounding the discussion in biological realities.

_**Being You**_ ultimately places consciousness within the context of life, arguing that to be conscious is to be a living, breathing organism engaged in a constant process of prediction and adaptation. This view brings consciousness down to earth, situating it firmly within the natural world rather than as something that separates us from it. Seth's work is a significant contribution to the ongoing exploration of consciousness, offering a framework that is both scientifically grounded and philosophically provocative. For readers interested in the intersection of neuroscience, philosophy, and the nature of self, this book provides a richly detailed and thought-provoking journey into what it means to be conscious, to be alive, and to be you.

Anil Seth's _Being You_ offers a thought-provoking exploration of consciousness through the lens of neuroscience, shifting the focus from abstract philosophical debates to tangible biological processes that define our sense of self and perception. Seth approaches consciousness not as a cosmic mystery but as a phenomenon deeply tied to our experience of being alive. He posits that consciousness is less about intelligence and more about the experience of being a self as a deeply embodied biological process. Conscious experiences, he argues, are "controlled hallucinations" that arise through and because of our living bodies.

Central to Seth's thesis is the idea that perception is not a direct reflection of reality but a top-down process where the brain's predictions shape what we experience. Our minds only ever contain interpretations, not direct sensory experiences, but those interpretations are controlled by the sensory experiences that generate them. This controlled hallucination is both more and less than what the world really is, as the brain continually updates its predictions based on new sensory data. This model explains why certain conscious experiences, like the color red, are not perceiving an essence "out there" but are devices evolution has developed to help us navigate the world.

Seth challenges the traditional view of the self as a fixed, unchanging entity. Instead, he presents the self as a perception, or rather, a collection of perceptions—a tightly woven bundle of neurally encoded predictions geared toward keeping your body alive. The self encompasses multiple components: the bodily self, the perspectival self, the volitional self, the narrative self, and the social self. These aspects, though seemingly bound together, can become disconnected, as seen in conditions like delirium, where one's sense of personal identity can warp or disappear entirely.

The book also explores the complex relationship between perception and action, positing that action is inseparable from perception. Perception does not merely lead to action; instead, the two processes determine each other. Active inference, where the brain constantly aims to minimize prediction errors, is presented as a key mechanism by which we navigate the world. This continuous loop of "what," "when," and "whether" we take an action underscores the idea that volition is not about willing an action but about the flow of voluntary actions and their inhibition, which we sometimes perceive more clearly than at other times.

Seth's discussion on machine consciousness is particularly striking. He argues against the functionalist idea that consciousness can be independent of the material substrate and purely a matter of information processing. Instead, Seth suggests that consciousness is an outcrop of the biological drive to stay alive. He expresses skepticism that machines, even if they were to mimic life-like behavior, could truly be conscious. Consciousness, in Seth's view, is deeply tied to the hierarchical self-maintenance of living systems, a quality that current AI lacks.

_**Being You**_ ultimately places consciousness within the natural world, asserting that the entirety of human experience and mental life arises because of, and not in spite of, our nature as self-sustaining biological organisms that care about their own persistence. This view brings consciousness down to earth, positioning it as a deeply biological process that is part of nature, just as our body is. Seth's work offers a scientifically grounded and philosophically provocative framework for understanding consciousness, making it a valuable read for anyone interested in the intersections of neuroscience, philosophy, and the nature of self.

Building off of that, replace it where appropriates from this shorter review by me: Anil Seth’s Being You dives into the nature of consciousness, blending cutting-edge neuroscience with deep philosophical inquiry. Seth invites us to rethink what it means to be conscious, challenging traditional boundaries between mind and body. He grounds our understanding of consciousness in neuroscience and explores the implications of these findings for our sense of self. 

Central to Seth’s argument is the idea that our experiences of the world and the self are constructed by the brain as “controlled hallucinations.” According to this theory, our minds are not windows to the outside world. Rather, they are probabilistic best guesses based on a host of signals, both internally and externally generated. In this sense, everything we experience is a hallucination, a creation of our mind. However, they are deeply grounded in the signals we are getting, thus leading to their being controlled. Consciousness, the author argues, arises from the phenomenological nature of creating the mental model for both sensing and taking action.

Whether or not you agree with his claim that this approach dissolves the hard problem of consciousness, Seth’s focus on neuroscience provides new insights into this challenging philosophical issue. (We will note that the book’s section on AI near the end feels a bit lacking, given the advancements in Generative AI in the past couple of years.)

Being You reminds us of the intricate and dynamic nature of consciousness, urging us to appreciate the complexity and wonder of our own minds. It catalyzes ongoing exploration into what it means to be conscious, for humans and beyond.

The shorter review effectively captures the essence of Seth's arguments but omits some of the more detailed analysis and specific points found in the longer review. Here are the key elements from the longer review that are lacking in the shorter review:

1. **Focus on the Shift from Philosophical Debates to Biological Processes**:
   - The longer review emphasizes how Seth shifts the focus from abstract philosophical debates to tangible biological processes that define our sense of self and perception. This grounding in biological processes is highlighted more thoroughly in the longer review.

2. **Detailed Explanation of the Controlled Hallucination Concept**:
   - The longer review provides a more nuanced explanation of how controlled hallucinations work, including the role of the brain's predictions and the continuous updating of these predictions based on new sensory data. It also elaborates on why specific conscious experiences, like the perception of color, are evolutionary adaptations rather than direct reflections of reality.

3. **Discussion on the Fluidity and Components of the Self**:
   - The longer review explores Seth’s view of the self as a dynamic collection of perceptions, detailing the different components of the self (bodily self, perspectival self, volitional self, narrative self, and social self) and how they can become disconnected. This detailed breakdown is absent in the shorter review.

4. **Complex Relationship Between Perception and Action**:
   - The longer review delves into the idea that action is inseparable from perception, explaining how they determine each other and introducing the concept of active inference. This nuanced exploration is only briefly touched upon in the shorter review.

5. **Critique of Machine Consciousness**:
   - While the shorter review mentions Seth’s discussion of machine consciousness, it lacks the depth found in the longer review, which discusses Seth’s skepticism about the possibility of truly conscious machines and his argument against the functionalist view.

6. **Final Reflection on Consciousness as Part of Nature**:
   - The longer review concludes with a reflection on how Seth situates consciousness within the natural world, asserting that it arises because of our nature as self-sustaining biological organisms. This philosophical reflection is less pronounced in the shorter review.

Overall, the shorter review effectively summarizes the main points but omits some of the detailed explanations, nuanced arguments, and philosophical reflections that give the longer review its depth and richness.

Anil Seth’s _Being You_ offers a rigorous exploration of consciousness, blending cutting-edge neuroscience with philosophical inquiry. Seth challenges traditional boundaries between mind and body, inviting readers to rethink what it means to be conscious. Grounded in neuroscience, Seth presents consciousness not as an abstract mystery but as a deeply embodied biological process, rooted in our experience of being alive. 

Central to Seth’s thesis is the concept that our experiences of the world and the self are "controlled hallucinations" constructed by the brain. According to Seth, our minds only contain interpretations, not direct sensory experiences, with these interpretations being controlled by the sensory signals we receive. This model suggests that everything we experience is a kind of hallucination, albeit one deeply grounded in both internal and external signals. Seth argues that consciousness arises from the brain's ability to predict and regulate the body's internal states, a process essential for survival.

Seth further challenges the traditional view of the self as a fixed, unchanging entity. Instead, he presents the self as a collection of perceptions—a bundle of neurally encoded predictions aimed at keeping the body alive. He delves into how different aspects of the self, such as the bodily self, the perspectival self, and the narrative self, can become disconnected in certain conditions, illustrating the fluid and dynamic nature of self-perception.

The book also examines the relationship between perception and action, introducing the idea of active inference, where the brain continually seeks to minimize prediction errors. This process underscores the notion that volition is not merely about willing an action but involves a continuous flow of voluntary actions and their inhibition. Seth’s exploration of this complex interplay provides new insights into the mechanisms that underpin our conscious experience.

In discussing machine consciousness, Seth takes a critical stance against the functionalist view that consciousness can be reduced to information processing alone. He argues that consciousness is intrinsically linked to the biological drive to stay alive, casting doubt on the possibility of truly conscious machines. This perspective adds a significant layer to the ongoing debate about the future of AI and its potential to replicate human consciousness.

_**Being You**_ ultimately situates consciousness within the natural world, emphasizing that human experience and mental life arise from our nature as self-sustaining biological organisms. Seth’s work challenges readers to appreciate the complexity and wonder of consciousness while grounding this inquiry in tangible biological processes. The book serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in the intersections of neuroscience, philosophy, and the nature of self, providing a scientifically grounded and thought-provoking framework for understanding what it means to be conscious.

Given my writing style and this edited version of the review, find ways to make it more concise and easier to read while keeping the overall flow, essence, and wording as much as possible:
This is definitely one of my top reads for the year. Anil Seth’s _Being You_ dives into the nature of consciousness, blending neuroscience with philosophical inquiry. Seth invites us to rethink what it means to be conscious, presenting consciousness as a deeply embodied biological process. 

Seth’s central argument is that our experiences of the world and the self are "controlled hallucinations" constructed by the brain. Our minds only ever contain interpretations, not direct sensory experiences, but those interpretations are controlled by the sensory experiences that generate them. In this sense, everything we experience is a hallucination, a creation of our mind. However, these hallucinations are deeply grounded in the signals we receive, both internally and externally, thus making them "controlled." Seth further argues that consciousness arises through and because of our living bodies, as the brain predicts and regulates the body's internal states. This model explains why specific conscious experiences, such as the perception of color, are not direct reflections of reality but evolutionary adaptations designed to help us navigate the world.

Seth also challenges the traditional view of the self as a fixed, unchanging entity. Instead, he presents the self as a perception, or rather, a collection of perceptions—a tightly woven bundle of neurally encoded predictions geared toward keeping your body alive. He details how the self comprises multiple components, such as the bodily self, the perspectival self, and the narrative self, and how these can become disconnected in various conditions, such as delirium.

The book explores the complex relationship between perception and action, positing that action is inseparable from perception. Active inference, where the brain constantly aims to minimize prediction errors, is presented as a key mechanism by which we navigate the world. This continuous loop of "what," "when," and "whether" we take an action underscores the idea that volition is not about willing an action but about the flow of voluntary actions and their inhibition (which we sometimes perceive more clearly than at other times).

Whether or not you agree with his claim that this approach dissolves the hard problem of consciousness, Seth’s focus on neuroscience provides new insights into this challenging philosophical issue. His discussion of the hierarchical self-maintenance of living systems and its implications for consciousness challenges us to reconsider our assumptions, particularly in light of debates on machine consciousness. Seth argues that consciousness is an outcrop of the biological drive to stay alive and expresses skepticism about the possibility of truly conscious machines, emphasizing that consciousness is deeply tied to the self-maintenance processes inherent in living organisms.

_Being You_ reminds us of the intricate and dynamic nature of consciousness. Seth groundsthis inquiry firmly within the natural world and our existence as self-sustaining biological organisms. By situating consciousness as a tangible biological process, Seth brings the discussion down to earth, offering a scientifically grounded and philosophically provocative framework for understanding the nature of self and perception.

Seth’s central argument is that our experiences of the world and self are "controlled hallucinations" created by the brain. Our minds contain interpretations, not direct sensory experiences, but these interpretations are guided by the sensory signals we receive. Thus, everything we experience is a kind of hallucination—grounded in reality, yet shaped by our brain's predictions. Seth argues that consciousness arises from our living bodies, as the brain predicts and regulates internal states. This explains why certain experiences, like color perception, are evolutionary adaptations rather than direct reflections of reality.
