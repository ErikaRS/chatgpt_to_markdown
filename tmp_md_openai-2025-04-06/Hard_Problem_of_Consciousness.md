The "hard problem of consciousness," a term coined by philosopher David Chalmers, refers to the difficulty of explaining *why* and *how* subjective experiences (or qualia) arise from physical processes in the brain. While we can understand the mechanisms of how the brain processes information (like detecting stimuli, reacting to the environment, or even having thoughts), it remains unclear why these processes are accompanied by an inner, subjective experience. In essence, the hard problem questions why certain brain activities result in the feeling of "what it's like" to be conscious. This contrasts with the "easy problems" of consciousness, which involve explaining cognitive functions and behavior that can be objectively studied and measured.
