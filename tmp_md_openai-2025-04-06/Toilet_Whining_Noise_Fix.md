A whining or whistling noise in your toilet that goes away after flushing typically points to an issue with the fill valve or water supply. Here are some common causes:

1. **Worn or Malfunctioning Fill Valve:** The fill valve controls the water flow into the tank after flushing. Over time, the internal components can wear out, causing a whistling or whining sound as water flows through it.

2. **Partially Closed Shutoff Valve:** If the shutoff valve (usually located beneath the toilet) is not fully open, it can restrict water flow and cause a whistling noise.

3. **High Water Pressure:** Excessively high water pressure can cause the fill valve to vibrate, leading to a whistling noise.

4. **Debris or Mineral Buildup:** Mineral deposits or debris in the fill valve can restrict water flow and create a whistling sound.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Inspect the Fill Valve:** Check if the noise is coming from the fill valve. If it is, replacing the valve is often the best solution.

2. **Adjust the Shutoff Valve:** Make sure the shutoff valve is fully open. If itâ€™s partially closed, open it all the way.

3. **Check Water Pressure:** If your home has high water pressure, consider installing a pressure regulator to reduce it.

4. **Flush Out Debris:** You can try flushing out any debris from the fill valve by turning off the water supply, disassembling the valve, and cleaning it.

If the noise persists, replacing the fill valve is often a simple and cost-effective fix.
