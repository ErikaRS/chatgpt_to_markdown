Silly. Milly likes carrots but she does not like potatoes. She likes strawberries but she does not like grapes. She likes balloons but she does not like bikes. She likes balls and dolls and frisbees. But she does not like games or bags or tea sets. She likes bees but she does not like cats. She likes giraffes but she does not like elephants.

What is the commonality among the things that silly Milly likes? A hint is in her name.

The commonality among the things that Silly Milly likes appears to be that each word has a double letter: 

- Carrots (rr)
- Strawberries (rr)
- Balloons (ll)
- Balls (ll)
- Dolls (ll)
- Frisbees (ee)
- Bees (ee)
- Giraffes (ff)

The hint was in her name, as "Milly" contains double 'l'.
