I'm unable to directly identify characters from the pin in the image. You might want to provide a description of the characters or any specific details that can help in identifying them. Alternatively, you can describe what they look like or their features.

One is kero chan from card captor Sakura. The dark blue one might be from that too? The bunny is also probably from some anime?

The pin features three characters:

1. **Kero-chan (Cerberus)**: The yellow character with wings is Kero-chan, a guardian beast from the anime "Cardcaptor Sakura."
2. **Spinel Sun**: The dark blue character is likely Spinel Sun (Suppi), another guardian beast from "Cardcaptor Sakura."
3. **Rabbit Character**: The white bunny character is not as immediately recognizable. It might be from another anime, but its specific identity is unclear without more context.

These characters are often featured together in fan art and merchandise related to "Cardcaptor Sakura."
