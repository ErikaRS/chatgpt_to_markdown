A more general term for teams that own code health, which encompasses DevX (Developer Experience) as well as other aspects, is "Engineering Productivity" or "EngProd" teams. These teams focus on improving the overall productivity of software engineers by optimizing processes, tools, and practices related to code health, testing, continuous integration, and deployment. They work to ensure that the developer experience is smooth and efficient, and that the codebase is maintainable, scalable, and reliable.
