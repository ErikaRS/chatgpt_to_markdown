In this statement, "making" feels coercive. Alternatives I've considered are "persuading" and "incentivizing" but suggest several more alternatives: We will grow monetized DAU by making tons of pro devs: (1) try our product, (2) love our product, (3) get it for their enterprise (by championing and spreading it internally).

The statement you've shared indeed carries a tone that might be perceived as coercive depending on the context. Your alternatives, "persuading" and "incentivizing," soften this impression by suggesting voluntary participation with an element of motivation. Here are several more alternatives that further diversify the approach, making it sound more appealing and less forceful:

1. **Encouraging** - This implies a gentle nudge towards trying and adopting the product without the pressure that "making" implies.

2. **Motivating** - Similar to "incentivizing," this suggests providing reasons or motivations for pro developers to engage with the product, but it focuses more on internal motivation rather than external rewards.

3. **Inspiring** - This elevates the approach by suggesting that the product itself, or the way it's presented, will inspire developers to try it, love it, and advocate for it.

4. **Engaging** - This focuses on creating an interesting, compelling product or marketing strategy that naturally draws developers in.

5. **Attracting** - This word suggests that the product has inherent qualities or benefits that make it naturally appealing to professional developers.

6. **Enabling** - This implies providing tools, resources, or support that make it easy and beneficial for developers to try the product and advocate for its adoption within their enterprises.

7. **Empowering** - This suggests giving developers the power or capability to use the product to its fullest potential, encouraging adoption through a sense of empowerment.

8. **Inviting** - This word conveys a friendly approach, suggesting an open, welcoming invitation to try the product without any pressure.

9. **Facilitating** - This focuses on making it easy for developers to try and adopt the product, perhaps through support, documentation, or community engagement.

10. **Fostering** - This suggests creating an environment or community that supports and nurtures interest and enthusiasm for the product among professional developers.

Each of these alternatives shifts the focus from coercion to a more positive, voluntary engagement with the product, which could be more effective in building a genuine and enthusiastic user base.

What's a pithier version of this: "When a decision needs to be made, the right person decides quickly with input from affected teams, then clearly communicates the decision."

"Decisions are swiftly made by the right person, informed by team input, and clearly communicated."

What's a pithier version of this: "Test, then invest. We experiment to quickly validate ideas and invest only in the most promising ones. We say no to most things so we can invest more into the things that matter most."

### Assistant - 2024-02-11 11:55:09

"Test before investing: Validate ideas quickly, focus on the promising, and prioritize what matters by saying no to the rest."

What's a pithier version of this: "We’ll continue to operate efficiently. By concentrating our efforts on fewer things, we’re able to do more with less."

"Efficiency through focus: doing more with less by prioritizing fewer tasks."
