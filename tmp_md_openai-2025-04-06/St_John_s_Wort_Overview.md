St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a flowering plant that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. Here are some key points about it:

1. **Uses**: It is commonly used for treating mild to moderate depression. Some people also use it for anxiety, sleep disorders, and nerve pain.

2. **Mechanism**: St. John's Wort is believed to work by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which help regulate mood.

3. **Efficacy**: Some studies suggest that St. John's Wort can be as effective as standard antidepressants for mild to moderate depression. However, its effectiveness for severe depression is less clear.

4. **Dosage**: The typical dose used in studies is 300 mg of an extract standardized to 0.3% hypericin, taken three times daily. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized dosing.

5. **Side Effects**: Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, increased sensitivity to sunlight, and fatigue. Serious side effects are rare.

6. **Interactions**: St. John's Wort can interact with many medications, including antidepressants, birth control pills, blood thinners, and certain cancer medications, potentially reducing their effectiveness. This is due to its ability to induce certain liver enzymes that metabolize drugs.

7. **Regulation**: In many countries, St. John's Wort is available as an over-the-counter supplement. However, the quality and concentration of active ingredients can vary between products.

8. **Precautions**: It should not be used in combination with other antidepressants due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting St. John's Wort, especially if you are taking other medications.

Is it ever used as a fresh plant

St. John's Wort is typically used in its dried form for medicinal purposes, but the fresh plant can also be used in some preparations. Here are a few ways it can be utilized fresh:

1. **Tinctures**: Fresh St. John's Wort flowers and leaves can be used to make tinctures. The fresh plant material is often preferred because it can contain higher levels of active compounds compared to dried plant material.

2. **Oils**: The fresh flowers of St. John's Wort can be infused in oil to create a red-colored herbal oil. This oil is often used topically for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.

3. **Teas**: Fresh leaves and flowers can be used to make herbal teas, though this is less common because drying the plant helps preserve its medicinal properties.

4. **Poultices**: Fresh St. John's Wort can be used to make poultices applied directly to the skin for minor wounds, bruises, or burns.

Using the fresh plant can provide certain benefits, such as potentially higher concentrations of active compounds, but it also requires careful handling to ensure proper preparation and avoid degradation of the beneficial components. Always consult with a healthcare provider or a knowledgeable herbalist when using fresh medicinal plants.
