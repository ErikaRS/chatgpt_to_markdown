What are some good emoji pairs to support this piece: 

 Playing with patterns
TO DELETE: Contributors: Jon, Scott, Erika, 

In the early 90s, Christopher Alexander’s breakthrough ideas in architecture and design intersected with the object oriented software engineering community. His ideas around pattern languages were at the periphery of contemporary architecture, but in software design communities they became central in how developers talked about code.

Design patterns have become a touchstone for software engineers. They’ve culminated in mature software libraries, frameworks, and design conventions. Practitioners often take time to learn these patterns: first by following guides and tutorials, then by instantiating these patterns inside a framework, and perhaps eventually adding their own patterns.

One could argue this is about to change. Patterns, by definition, are instantiated repeatedly. It stands to reason that this repetition burns their latent representation into Generative AI systems. Perhaps, with AI coding assistants, humans no longer need to think about software design patterns. 

But what if we flip this around? What if LLMs, given their ability to operate at the intersection of many pattern languages, can provide novel ways to identify patterns fit to local conditions and requirements? The ability to mass-customize pattern languages to a particular context could help us explore new ways of applying and combining them. Just as we may ask a text-to-image model to generate an image of an astronaut riding a horse on the moon, we can ask a copilot to define a persistence strategy pattern over CQRS with support for dependency injected logging.

Seeing patterns as just the beginning of a larger journey echoes Alexander’s own thinking. Just as software design patterns were growing in popularity, Alexander himself had moved beyond patterns to a search for what makes systems alive. He found pattern languages somewhat restrictive—and explicitly warned against over-indexing on them. 

Being able to play with patterns may provoke novel ways of building. Instead of using a design language like Material, imagine generating one that perfectly matches your needs. Instead of using a framework like React, you generate a framework that’s only as complicated as your application needs. This may start chaotic but yield novel ways of building. 

This ability to contextualize patterns applies beyond software. Returning to Christopher Alexander, we can use generative AI to imagine structures which interpolate between architectural patterns. For example, we could interpolate between three patterns: (1) courtyards which live, (2) entrance transitions, and (3) light on two sides of every room. We might end up with something like this, showing how these three patterns might be combined:

Key to all of these explorations is realizing that the patterns themselves do not contain the truth of what makes a structure come to life or a software system effective. We need to be able to pull on our experience of these systems to understand if they are alive, whole, centered. Playing with patterns can help us by breaking out of the rigid confines that any defined pattern language can impose. However, if we do not ensure those new patterns have their own sense of life, we can end up with patterns that are more like a plastic palm tree than a stately redwood. 

Yet overall, we are optimistic. When tools enable new ways of seeing and concept generation, surprising things can happen - the microscope, telescope, and x-rays all changed the way we thought of the world around us. What if LLMs can help provide a way to see across patterns and connections we don't fully fathom? Who knows, maybe it’ll help us along that journey in finding Christopher Alexander’s elusive “quality without a name”.
