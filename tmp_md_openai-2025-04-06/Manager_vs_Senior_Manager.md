In tech companies, as well as many other industries, job titles like "manager" and "senior manager" are used to indicate levels of responsibility and experience within the organizational hierarchy. The specifics can vary by company, but in general:

**Manager:**

1. **Role:** Manages individual contributors or a small team. Often directly involved in the day-to-day work and operations of their team. 
2. **Responsibility:** Responsible for the output and performance of their team. This includes setting goals, providing feedback, and ensuring that the team meets its objectives.
3. **Experience:** Typically, managers have several years of experience in their field and have often been individual contributors before moving into a managerial role.
4. **Skills:** A manager is expected to be proficient in both technical aspects (related to their specific domain) and in people management. This means handling team dynamics, motivating team members, and ensuring that the team is working efficiently.
5. **Decision-Making:** Makes decisions at a team level, and is often responsible for implementing decisions made by senior management.

**Senior Manager:**

1. **Role:** Manages multiple teams or a larger team, or oversees multiple managers. They are often one step removed from the day-to-day operations and focus more on strategy and long-term planning.
2. **Responsibility:** Ensures that multiple teams or departments are aligned and working towards the company's strategic objectives. They may be responsible for setting the direction for a larger part of the organization.
3. **Experience:** Senior managers often have extensive experience, not just in their field, but also in management. They've typically been managers before moving up to this role.
4. **Skills:** In addition to the skills expected of a manager, senior managers often need to be adept at organizational strategy, cross-functional collaboration, and high-level decision-making.
5. **Decision-Making:** Senior managers are involved in more strategic decisions that impact larger portions of the company. They often contribute to or shape company strategy and may liaise with top-level executives.

It's worth noting that the distinction between these roles, their responsibilities, and their qualifications can vary significantly based on the company's size, culture, and specific industry within tech. For example, in a startup, the differences between a manager and senior manager might be less pronounced than in a large multinational tech company.
