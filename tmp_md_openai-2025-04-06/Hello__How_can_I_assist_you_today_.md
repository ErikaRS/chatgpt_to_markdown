Certainly! Here's a 10-minute relaxing bedtime routine for a busy working mom:

1. **Deep Breathing (1 minute):** Start by sitting or lying down comfortably. Take deep breaths in and out, focusing on the rise and fall of your chest. This helps in calming your mind and preparing you for sleep.

2. **Quick Face Wash (2 minutes):** Use a gentle cleanser to wash off the day's stress and impurities. This not only cleans your face but can also be a refreshing sensory experience.

3. **Moisturize (1 minute):** Apply a light night cream or moisturizer. This not only keeps your skin hydrated but the act of massaging it in can be quite therapeutic.

4. **Wear Comfortable PJs (1 minute):** Slip into your favorite comfortable pajamas. Choosing soft fabrics can give a comforting feeling.

5. **Set Aside Tomorrow's Essentials (2 minutes):** Quickly lay out the next dayâ€™s outfit or essentials. This small act can save you precious morning minutes and reduce stress.

6. **Mindful Sip (1 minute):** Have a sip of calming herbal tea like chamomile or a warm glass of milk. Avoid caffeine. This act can signal your body that it's time to wind down.

7. **Gratitude Moment (1 minute):** Reflect on one good thing that happened in the day, no matter how small. Focusing on positive moments can help release stress.

8. **Lights Out (1 minute):** Turn off all lights and electronic devices. If you like, turn on a soft night light or a white noise machine to drown out any background noises.

Remember, consistency is key. Over time, as this routine becomes a habit, it will signal your body that it's time for rest, helping you fall asleep quicker and enjoy better quality sleep.
