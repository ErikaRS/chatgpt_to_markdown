## Review
My rating: 4/5

In *The Self-Driven Child* Strixrud and Johnson look at the importance of instilling a healthy sense of control in children. They emphasize that a sense of control is linked to many positive outcomes around health, well-being, academic success, and overall happiness.  The authors stress that parents should aim to teach their children independence rather than control them, acting more as consultants than managers. By allowing children to make meaningful choices and find their inner motivation, parents can nurture children's ability to navigate life successfully.

The book highlights the detrimental effects of chronic stress on young brains,. A sense of control is the antidote to stress. This isn't to say that all stress is bad. Some stress can be positive and increase motivation and resilience. Other stress is tolerable and helps kids learn how to better handle stress. But toxic stress is harmful and reduces kids ability to cope in the long time. Parents often try to protect their kids of any sort of stress, but by letting children how deal with stress in a healthy way, they are teaching them how to handle it better. 



In conclusion, "The Self-Driven Child" offers a compelling argument for the importance of fostering a healthy sense of control in children to promote their well-being and success. It provides practical advice for parents on how to empower their children to become self-directed learners and resilient individuals. By reframing the parent-child relationship as one of guidance rather than enforcement, the book encourages parents to prioritize their children's autonomy and growth. Overall, this book serves as a valuable resource for parents seeking to raise independent, self-motivated children in today's complex world.

## Key arguments and takeaways
- Children need a sense of control to thrive
- Parents should start building up that autonomy early
- Doing this requires letting children make their own choices, even when you might agree
- It also requires letting them fail
- However, it doesn't mean letting them do whatever they want
- Parents should see themselves as consultants: their job is to make sure their children have the information they need to make informed decisions and help guide them through those decisions. But ultimately kids need to make their own decisions and own implementing those decisions.
- The big exception to all this is issues of safety such as addiction, chemical abuse, or thoughts of self-harm

## Detailed notes
#### Introduction: Why a Sense of Control Is Such a Big Deal

##### Notes
Having a sense of control is extremely important for human well being, including for children and young adults. It's related to virtually everything we want for our children: physical and mental health, academic success, happiness. When they don't have a healthy sense of control they are at higher risk for anxiety, anger management, self destructive behaviors, or self-medicating. 

We need to start with the assumption that with support, our kids will figure out the right decisions for them. The parents should think of themselves as consults. They have valuable expertise, but ultimately it's the child, their client, who decides and executes. 

Giving children a greater sense of self-control also reduces the anxiety parents feel for making sure their children's lives turn out well.

##### Notes
This chapter introduces how stress impacts the brain, especially the developing brain, and why a sense of control helps to reduce the problems that come with chronic stress.

A lack of a sense of control is a key contributor to chronic stress, which has all sorts of negative short and long term effects, especially on brain development. 

Increased stress generally occurs when someone is exposed to N.U.T.S.:
- Novelty: something oyou have not experienced before
- Unpredictability: something you had no way of knowing would occur
- Threat to the ego: something that calls your safety or competence as a person into question
- (decreased) Sense of control: you feel you have little or no control over the situation

It's important to note that it's the sense of control that matters. If someone has confidence, that they can impact a situation, they'll have lower stress regardless of their ability to control the situation. Similarly, if they don't think they can, they'll feel stressed even if they actually can. 

Children have very little agency. Often at home and at school, they are constantly having decisions made for them. Their lives are structured and scheduled. They get told, "Here's the plan" instead of getting to help make the plan.

The goal isn't make children's life stress free. We want them to learn how to deal successfully with stressful situations. Helping our children develop a high stress tolerance helps them develop resilience. Rather, we need to distinguish between 
- **positive stress** which can motivate growth and high performance
- **tolerable stress** which occurs for brief periods and can help build resilience if children have supportive adults there to help them cope and recover
- **toxic stress** which is frequent or prolonged activation of the stress system in the absence of support. Toxic stress is harmful and reduces stress tolerance.

A healthy sense of control involves the executive control system, the stress response system, the motivation system, and the resting state system. The executive control system is the pilot. It's active when we are calm, fully rested, and feel in control. The more we feel in control, the more effective it is. Mild stress creates greater focus. 

The stress response system is the lion fighter that jumps into action when you feel threatened. When it's active, our behavior tends to be defensive, reactive, inflexible, and can be aggressive. If this spikes quickly in the face of thread and subsides, that's a healthy response. Longer term stress spikes can result in problems.

The motivational system is the brain's cheerleader, it's reward center. Good experience cause spikes of dopamine. But dopamine isn't just about good feelings. An optimal level of dopamine also allows for a flow state. It's less about getting than it is about wanting. It's the key to drive. Chronic stress reduces this.

The resting state is the brain's Buddha. The resting state of the brain went unstudied for years, but eventually researchers discovered that there is a default mode network that is only active when we are "doing nothing". We don't know exactly how it works, but it is critical for rejuvenating, storing information, gaining perspective, processing complicated ideas, and creativity. It also is linked to developing a sense of identity and empathy.

The key takeaway of all of this is that chronic stress makes the brain less effective. It dampens memory, reasoning, attention, judgment, and emotional control and can cause long term damage. 

Chronic stress creates a feeling of helplessness and can lead to many negative behavioral problems and, left untreated, can spiral into depression. This is especially problematic for young people whose brains will be directly impacted by chronic stress. Adolescents, in particular, already experience exaggerated stress responses and have a lower stress tolerance than adults. Anxiety and chronic stress during these years creates a higher risk of depression as an adult. 

The chapter ends with the caveat that society has a harmful expectation that if someone works hard enough, then they'll succeed... and if they don't succeed, they didn't work hard enough. Having a sense of control isn't about working hard to succeed. It's about how people deal with the setbacks that will inevitably occur in their lives. 

What to Do Tonight (quoted directly)
- Make a list of the things your child has control over. Is there anything you can add to that list?
- Ask your child if there are things he feels he'd like to be in charge of that he currently isn't.
- Consider your language around making plans. Do you say, "Today we're going to do this and then this," or do you offer choices?
- Tell your kids (if they're ten or older) something like this: "I just read something really interesting-that there are four things about life that make it stressful: new situations, situations that are unpredictable, situations where you feel you could be hurt, criticized, or embarrassed, and situations where you don't feel you can control what's happening. It's interesting, because in my job I get most stressed when I feel I'm expected to make something happen but I can't control everything that is necessary to make it happen. Are there things that make you stressed?" By identifying stress in your own life and talking about it, you are modeling stress awareness-a critical step in curbing the effects of stress. As the saying goes, "You've got to name it to tame it."
- If your kid seems to be really anxious, talk to your pediatrician about it. Determine whether same kind of professional intervention is necessary. Research suggests that treating anxiety early significantly lowers the risk of recurring problems.
- You can let your worried child know that she's safe, that you're there for her, but don't reassure her excessively. Let her know that you have confidence in her ability to handle the stressors in her life. But don't minimize what she is feeling or try to fix it for her.
- Think about ways in which you may, intentionally or inadvertently, be trying to protect your kids from experiencing mildly stressful situations that they could grow from. Are you too focused on safety? Are there situations in which you could give your child more independence or more choices?
- Dozens of scales have been developed over the years to measure a person's sense of control. The granddaddy of them all is the Rotter Scale, developed by J. B. Rotter in 1966. We highly encourage you to take it so that you can assess your own strengths and struggles when it comes to autonomy. For kids, we like a scale developed by Steven Nowicki and Bonnie Strickland, which asks questions such as "Do you believe that you can stop yourself from catching a cold?" and "When a person doesn't like you, is there anything you can do about it?" You may be surprised by where your child lands.

- The Big Picture
- What to Do Tonight

##### Notes
Homework is a domain where the message kids often hear is one of control, one where the parent knows right and the child does not. But parents cannot make children do homework, and forcing just creates conflict and procrastination. It harms the relationship between parents and children, moving it from a place where children can recover from stress to a source of stress. 

Constantly pushing kids risks creating kids who don't have a well developed sense of internal motivation. This means that they constantly need to be pushed to make progress. In the long run — and the medium run — helping kids gain a sense of control and internal motivation will help them to their best. However, this means giving up some of your sense of control as a parent. "If you act as if it's your job to see that your child does his homework, practices the piano, or plays a sport, you reinforce the mistaken belief that somebody other than he is responsible for getting his work done."

As they summarize it in the chapter:
> 1. You can't make your kids do something against their will.
> 2. You can't make your kids want something they don't want.
> 3. You can't make your kids not want what they want.
> 4. It's okay, at least right now, for them to want what they want and not want what they don't want.

The bulk of the chapter reinforces how you can't force children to do things and why it's harmful if you try. It also talks about what you can do as an alternative. You can be supportive but not controlling, an authoritative parent. This mode of parenting values maturity over obedience. Parents enforce limits but they don't control. For example, with homework authoritative parents let their children know when and how they're willing to help and provide environments conducive to homework, but they don't force the work.

This approach is successful because it helps the child to develop their own skills for doing what they need to. It also reduces the emotional temperature in the household. It has challenges (and the authors suggest various ways to combat them), but in the long term it is easier as kids develop their skills. 

What to do tonight (quoted directly)
- Practice asking, "Who is responsible for this?" "Whose problem is it?"
- Determine if your home is a safe base. Do you fight frequently about food or screen time? What's the emotional temperature? If you are feeling frustrated with your kid, chances are he is with you as well. Ask him
- If a kid hates or resists homework, suggest a homework club at school, find older kids to work with him, or approach your child's teacher about minimizing mandatory homework. If your child's strong negative reactions to homework are out of character, have your child evaluated to rule out a problem like a learning disability.
- Help your child create an effective learning environment and, if necessary, develop her own system of rewards for completing goals. If she does not meet a goal, respond with compassion: "I'm sorry you weren't able to meet your goals tonight." Don't get angry or threaten punishment. Your job is to help her develop ways to motivate herself.
- Express confidence in your child's ability to figure things out.

##### Notes
The message of this chapter is that if you trust your kids to make informed decisions and provide them with the tools to do so, then they'll make the decisions that are right for them, even if they aren't the decisions you would make.

> Start with the basics, by adopting the following three precepts when it comes to your kids:
> 1. "You are the expert on you."
> 2. "You have a brain in your head."
> 3. "You want your life to work."
> When you buy into these things, it's much easier to tell your kid, "It's your call. I have confidence in your ability to make informed decisions about your own life and to learn from your mistakes."

This doesn't mean that the kid gets to call all the shots or that there aren't limits. Parents still need to set clear ground rules which kids can work within, focusing on areas where kids are not yet ready to make decisions on their own. Rather, kids should be the ones making decisions in the areas where they are capable. 

Doing this heightens kids sense of control and increases their capability for making good decisions. 

Parents can enable their children to make good decisions by helping them learn how to make good decisions. They can provide information, talk through pros and cons, help them get feedback from others with more experience, and help the child create a plan B. It's important to help them think through the downsides, especially when they are teens and their brain focuses on rewards more than risks. 

Kids won't make perfect decisions, so it's important to have strategies for following up, such as asking "How'd that work for you?" and discussing ways to make better decisions next time. Parents should also seek to understand their children's decisions, especially when those decisions don't align with what the parent would decide. 

What to do tonight (directly quoted):
- Tell your child, "You're the expert on you. Nobody really knows you better than you know yourself, because nobody really knows what it feels like to be you."
- Give your child a choice about something you may have previously decided for her. Or ask her opinion about something. (If they're young, you can frame it as, "Do you think we should do it this way or that way?")
 - Have a family meeting where you problem solve together about what chores need to be done and who should do them. Give them options. Could they walk the dog instead of doing the dinner dishes? Take out the trash instead of cleaning the toilet? Do they want to do it each Sunday or each Wednesday? Morning or night? Keep a consistent schedule, but let them choose that schedule.
- Make a list of things your child would like to be in charge of, and make a plan to shift responsibility for some of these things from you to him or her.
- Ask your child whether something in his life isn't working for him (his homework routine, bedtime, management of electronics) and if he has any ideas about how to make it work better.
- Do a cost-benefit analysis of any decision you make for your child that she sees differently.
- Tell your child about decisions you've made that, in retrospect, were not the best decisions-and how you were able to learn and grow from them.
- Have a talk in which you point out that your kid has got a good mind. Recall some times when he's made a good decision or felt strongly about something and turned out to be right. If he'll let you, make a list together of the things he's decided for himself that have worked well.
- Tell your teen you want him to have lots of practice running his own life before he goes off to college and that you want to see that he can run his life without running it into the ground before he goes away.
- Emphasize logical and natural consequences, and encourage the use of family meetings to discuss family rules or family policies more generally (e.g., no gaming during the week),

- What to Do Tonight

##### Notes
It's hard to help your kids find a sense of control when you are constantly projecting a sense of anxiety. Children benefit greatly from parents who can serve as a nonanxious presence. This parental sense of calm helps children find their own sense of calm. This is especially important because a sense of stress tends to move between people. 

The chapter also gives some concrete advice on how to be a nonanxious presence around your children. Start by making enjoying your kids your top parenting priority. By focusing on this rather than on any particular outcome you want for them, you'll make the present moment the best it can be. You can also reducing anxiety by not fearing the future. Realize that there are many paths to happiness beyond the narrow ones that easily come to mind, and that very rarely do single decisions determine which path your child will take. You can also learn to accept without judging. Your child's life is not yours to control, and accepting them for who they are conveys respect.

Managing your own stress, be it about your children or anything else, will also make it easier to be a nonanxious presence. We need to take care of us and get exercise and sleep. We need to slow down and remember that downtime is important for adults, not just kids. You can also think through your worst fears and realize that no matter what happens, you will still love and  support your child. 

What to do tonight (directly quoted):
- Spend private time with your child, ideally without electronics. Take turns with each child if you have more than one, so that the ratio is one-on-one. It is remarkably healing for kids and will help you to enjoy them. It also makes them feel like they are your number one priority.
- If you're highly anxious, do something about it. Treating anxiety is one of the best things you can do for yourself and your family. Consider participating in cognitive behavioral therapy: you can learn very effective strategies for identifying and "talking back to the distorted and unproductive thoughts that contribute to high anxiety. Learn to meditate. Take a yoga class. Be very regular in your exercise routine. Spend time in nature. Get more sleep. Socialize more with friends if it helps you feel calm.
- Avoid making decisions for your child based on fear. If you find yourself thinking, "I'm afraid if I don't do this now, then- stop. Do what you feel is right now, not what you feel you have to because of what you're afraid will happen if you don't.
- If your child is struggling, schedule a short time every day for you to worry about his or her problems. Literally write it into your planner. This will let your brain know that it is safe not to worry all day long.
 - Remember who's responsible for what. It cannot be your responsibility to see that everything goes well for your children at all times.
- If you are very worried about your teenager and have talked through the issues together many times, write your child a short letter summarizing your concerns and offering any help the child might need. Then promise that you will not bring the issue up again for a month. When you break your promise (because you will) apologize and recommit to it.
- Get out a piece of paper and draw a vertical line in the middle, in the left-hand column, write statements such as the following: "It's okay for Jeremy to have a leaming disability," "It's okay that Sarah doesn't have any friends right now," "it's okay for Ben to be depressed right now." in the night-hand column, write down the automatic thoughts that come to your mind in response (likely rebuttal) to these statements. Then question these automatic thoughts. Ask questions such as, "Can I be absolutely sure that this thought is true?" "Who would I be if I didn't believe this?" This kind of self-questioning exercise, developed by author and speaker Byron Katie and others, can serve as a useful tool for discovering the thoughts that trap you into negative judgments.
- Create a stress-reduction plan for yourself. Can you get more exercise? More sleep? What calms you down and how can you do more of it? Don't make yourself available to your kids at the expense of your own well- being. Wall off some "me" time.
- Model self-acceptance and tell your kids what you're doing.

##### Notes
This chapter discusses how we can foster internal motivation in our kids. Motivation comes from these key ingredients:
- The right mindset 
    - Parents can promote a growth mindset by praising effort and strategies rather than built-in ability.
- Autonomy, competence, and relatedness
    - A sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are basic human needs. The best way to motivate kids is to support their sense of control. Give them as much autonomy as possible, including asking them what they want to be competent at and in charge of. Competence is about feeling we can handle a situation, not about external measures of accomplishment. Relatedness is relevant to motivation because we are willing to work harder for those we feel connected too. For parents, this means showing your children you love them unconditionally. 
- The optimal level of dopamine
    - When we are bored, we are not motivated enough to sustain effort. Children can develop a healthy dopamine system when we encourage them to work hard at what they love.
- Flow
    - Working hard at something a kid loves and finds challenging helps them enter a flow state. The flow state, in turn, enhances performance. Flow requires a task to be challenging enough to not be boring but not so difficult as to be stressful. When we see our children in flow, let them be. 

Parents need to remember that their children's brains work different from their brains. Boys and girls also tend to have different brains during childhood and adolesence. Girls tend to have higher standards and evaluate their performance more critically. They tend to be more interested in pleasing others. Girls generally want to be on top of things and find procrastination stressful. Boys tend to find it stimulating. Note that factors such as ADHD, anxiety, or depression tend to have effects above and beyond gender and that while there are general tendencies, each child will be motivated in their own way. 

The chapter ends with a discussion of common motivation problems and how parents can overcome them. 

What to do tonight (directly quoted):
- Support autonomy, support autonomy, support autonomy.
- Explore where your child's true inner motivation lies. You can do this by asking when in life he or she feels "really happy." Kids with a healthy self-drive will commonly think of times when they perform well in school or in sports, are engaged in pleasurable pastimes, or do something fun with their friends or family. In contrast, kids who are obsessively motivated or have difficulty sustaining motivation and effort will often say that they feel happiest when they have no responsibilities, when nothing is expected of them, and when they feel no pressure.
- Make a point of speaking with your kids about what it is they want in life. What do they love to do? What do they feel they're good at? If there's a reason they're here, what might that be?
- Help your child articulate (and write down) goals. We will explore this in more depth in Chapter Ten. For now, simply the act of voicing where she wants to get is a remarkably constructive step.
- Encourage flow in any activity by giving your kids the space and time they need to do what they love.
- Teach and model a love of challenge and persistence in the face of difficulty. Attribute positive motivational qualities to young kids (e.g., "I've noticed that you don't give up on things..
- Teach your kids not to be overly preoccupied with pleasing others. If they're focused on external feedback, consider occasionally saying something like, "Everybody feels good when they're successful at things and get positive feedback from other people. It's completely normal. My experience, though, is that the wisest thing is to evaluate your own performance and to focus on getting better at doing the right thing."
- If your child doesn't seem to have a passion, remember that there are many people and experiences that will positively influence their lives. Seek out mentors or role models in different fields, and expose them to a range of careers and life choices

##### Notes
Downtime is important for mental development, be it sleep or daydreaming. Activating our Default Mode Network allows our consciousness to take break, giving your brain an opportunity to engage in important self reflection. The goal is to alternate periods of connection and activity with periods of quiet time. Meditation also has many benefits for children and adolescents, just as it does for adult. Mindfulness, paying attention in a mindful way, can lower stress, aggression, social anxiety, and improve executive function. Transcendental meditation allows the nervous system to experience deep rest which increases resilience and helps people let go of things more quickly. Any type of meditation helps lead to a deeply rested brain. 

What to do tonight (directly quoted)
- Look for opportunities during the day to let your mind wander. This could mean just sitting quietly for a few minutes looking out the window or at the clouds. It could also mean engaging in activities you can largely do "mindlessly" (eg, mowing the lawn) that enable you to "be with yourself."
- Talk as a family about the importance of going off-line and giving yourself truly free time. If they're open to hearing it, tell your kids that it's only when they aren't focused on anything in particular that they can really think about themselves and other people. Also tell them that discoveries and insights will often come when you let your mind wander, and that they need downtime to solidify the things they're learning in school.
- Ask your child, "Do you feel you have enough time to yourself, time when you're not studying, doing sports, texting, or talking to other people? Do you have enough time just to chill?" If your child says no, help him to think through when he might find a few times in his day to sit quietly and let his mind wander. Think out loud with your kids about the challenge of building in enough time for yourself.
- The next time you're driving with your child, instead of turning to technology, say, "Do you mind if we take a couple of minutes to just take in the scenery?"
- Consider learning to meditate yourself. The University of Massachusetts Medical School has a Center for Mindfulness with great resources (umassmed.edu/cfm), as does the University of California, San Diego (health.ucsd.edu/specialties/mindfulness/Pages/default.aspx), and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (centerhealthyminds.org). You can also visit the main TM Web site (tm.org). If you're interested in TM. attend an introductory lecture at your nearest center, and see if your middle- or high-school-age child would be willing to come along. Let your kids know about the dozens of celebrities who practice and endorse TM, including those who are popular with teenagers (currently Katy Perry, Kesha, -Margaret Cho, and Hugh Jackman) to pique their interest.
- If you're interested in mindfulness, you could try a mindfulness app with your child, such as Headspace or Mind Yeti, which can be particularly useful at times of stress. For younger kids, check out Lauren Alderfer's book Mindful Monkey, Happy Panda and Eline Snel's book and CD combo Sitting Still Like a Frog.


#### Chapter Seven: Sleep: "The Most Radical Downtime"

- What to Do Tonight

##### Notes
This chapter dives deeper into sleep, the most important form of downtime. Sleep deprivation is common, especially among teens. Sleep deprivation is a form of chronic stress. Lack of sleep impairs emotional control and may be behind many of the negative emotions we associate with teens. Sleep deprivation also has physical implications  and impairs learning. 

What to do tonight (direct quote)
- Make sleep a family value, and set a family goal of sleeping more. Ned always tells his teenage students, "Pay yourself first," a lesson adopted from financial planning that involves putting money into your savings account before you pay your bills. He tells kids "you'll need to sleep something in the neighborhood of sixty-three hours a week (nine hours a day), so plan that and then plan what you'll do the rest of the time." It's good advice for you as well as your kids. Talk to your kids about your own sleep- related challenges, and let them know if you've found things that have worked for you. Tell them you're open to their suggestions.
- Assess whether your child has an effective wind-down routine before bed. If not, read about what experts call good sleep hygiene, or sleep habits. Try getting ready for bed before you're really tired, as it's harder to inhibit the desire to do one more thing or watch one more episode when you're tired. Encourage your teens to try the same thing. Dim lights and pull shades at least thirty minutes before a child's bedtime, which will trigger melatonin production. Try using blackout curtains and/or relaxation tapes Also try warm milk, which actually does have a sleep-inducing effect. If necessary, talk to your pediatrician about the use of melatonin, which can be very effective for highly anxious kids and for kids with ADHD. Encourage exercise during the day, particularly if falling asleep in the first place is hard.
- If your child is a light sleeper or struggles to fall asleep, consider a white-noise generator.
- If your child is an athlete, do a Google search for studies that document the incredibly powerful effect sleep has on athletic performance. A study of Stanford basketball players found that they all ran faster and shot more accurately after several weeks of training when they got more than eight Furs of sleep a night. Let your kid know that, on the advice of sleep specialists, many NBA teams have eliminated morning shootarounds to give players more sleep.
- Talk as a family about creating technology free zones in the bedroom at night. Danny Lewin recommends that kids and parents) leave their devices charging in the kitchen thirty to sixty minutes before bedtime. (This gives us a chance to resist our phone only once, rather than all night) Lewin also encourages negotiating with teenagers in a respectful way. If no phones in the bedroom seven nights in a row is too much for your teenager to manage, how about five? Then you and your child can discuss the difference between what happens when the phone is in the room and when it isn't. If your child insists that she needs her phone because she uses it as an alarm clock, go to the store immediately and buy her an alarm clock Get her the most high-end kind she wants. It's money well spent. 
- Suggest that your high school child ask her friends or other kids in her grade who do get eight-plus hours of sleep a night how they do it. Kids commonly learn more from each other than they do from adults.
- If your kids are tired, remind them to be patient with themselves and with others. Help them recognize that their emotional reactions will be different when they're tired-and that they'll be more irritable with you and with friends.
- Ideally, we want kids to learn to calm themselves. But there are some-particularly those with ADHD or anxiety problems for whom it's too hard. Some kids need to listen to music (but not on their phones) or even to have the TV on to fall asleep. Though it's not ideal, it's not worth fighting about if it works.
- Encourage your sleepy teenager to take a twenty-minute power nap after school or during study hall. Naps shouldn't be longer than that, otherwise they can cause grogginess and throw off sleep rhythms for the night. Think of them as a little pick-me-up to get through to bedtime.
- For kids who have sleep disorders and/or are suffering from severe sleep deprivation, consider having a doctor write a letter recommending that they be permitted to miss first period. Also check out the sleep tool kit on www.racetonowhere.com/sleep-page.
- If your kid's circadian clock is off, exposure to bright light early in the morning can be an effective tool, but consult with an expert on sleep before trying light therapy. Also, if weather permits, go camping. We constantly encounter kids who struggle with sleep the whole year, and then summer camp gets them back on track. For the duration of the camp they're in bed at 9:30, because there's no electric light or digital technology. A camping trip won't be feasible if it's in the middle of winter, or if you live in the northern parts of the world where the sun doesn't go down until very late. But it's a very effective technique when you can swing it.
- Continue reading about sleep. Books we recommend are Helene Ensellem's Snooze... or Lose! and Dr. Richard Ferber's Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems.
- Assess the extent to which school commitments and particularly homework-are undermining your child's efforts to get to bed. This last is not a simple matter which is why your child's school environment is the subject of the entire next chapter.

#### Chapter Eight: Taking a Sense of Control to School
##### Contents
- Get Them Engaged
- Reduce Academic Stress and Pressure
- Homework: Inspire—But Don't Require
- Teach Kids When They're Ready
- Test Kids the Right Way
- Ways to Bring a Sense of Control to School

##### Notes
Like most materials on the shortcoming of the school system, this chapter is somewhat frustrating because a lot of this is outside of parents control. 

School isn't necessarily structured to support healthy brain development, so how can kids have a sense of control at school? 
- One thing that parents can do is help kids feel engaged at school. They can start by giving kids a sense of autonomy outside of school. Parents can also encourage teachers to give some amount of choice in the classroom (e.g., allowing kids to explore strategies). Kids will also experience more autonomy if they feel more connected to their teacher. 
- One of the biggest things parents can do is teach children that they are in charge of their own education, not their parent or their teacher. Parents can also work to reduce academic stress and pressure. 
- Kids learn best when they're in a high challenge, low stress environment. They need to be in an environment where it it safe to explore, make mistakes, and take the time they need to learn and produce good work. Although school does not always enable this, parents can help by making sure our kids understand that school is about development, not perfect grades. 
- Homework should be centered around inspiring kids to learn and should be limited in quantity. 
- Kids should be taught material when they're ready. If they encounter it too early, they will end up frustrated and experience a low sense of control. Earlier isn't better, nor is more. 
- Testing should be about helping to reinforce learning and help kids get a sense of what they don't know. It shouldn't be centered on high stakes testing. 
- Ideally, schools would focus on nurturing healthy brain development, self-understanding, and self-regulation and less on test scores. They would promote self-motivation and provide autonomy to maximize engagement. 

What to do tonight (quoted):
- Teach your kids that they are resposible for their own education. Kids should feel in charge, not that school is being done "to them." Note this is very different from blaming kids who are struggling.
- If your child is not learning from his teacher, acknowledge this without blaming the teacher. "Mr. Cooper is doing the best he can. He just doesn't know how to teach you the way you learn." Encourage your child to think of what will motivate him to master the material being taught in the class anyway.
- Remind your child of the big picture, that grades matter less than the ways he or she develops as a student and person.
- Resist the pressure to push your child if he's not ready, be it reading in kindergarten, algebra in eighth grade, or AP classes in high school
- Create an advocacy group made of up teachers, parents, and kids to talk about what you can all do to make school a less stressful experience. Consider advocating for brain-friendly experiences in school such as exercise, the arts, and meditation.

##### Notes
Kids use a lot of technology. Technology can be an incredibly tool, but the amount of time kids (and adults) spend on it displaces many valuable uses of time: family time, face-to-face interaction with friends, study time, physical activity, and sleep. Technology can also train the brain to expect constant stimulation. The goal of parents with technology is to teach children how to stay in charge. Anticipation is addictive, and the more technology kids use, the poorer their self-regulation, physical health problems, attention problems, and behavior problems.

Parents can help kids learn to self-regulate. It's key that kids learn how to regulate technology use themselves, and parents can help this by working with your kids to set limits and help them work within them. One thing that parents need to do is model responsible use of technology. Parents need to seek to understand what is appealing about technology, whether it's about the social experience or video games. Parents can help create technology-free time where kids are immersed in natural beauty. Parents also need to remember that their role is to be a consultant and inform, not judge. Involve your kids around decision making around technology. Finally, do keep some limits in place. Let kids know that you will know their passwords, make responsible use of technology a requirement for parents paying for it, make sure high school students know that they need to be able to use technology responsibly before you'll pay for college. 

What to do tonight (quoted):
- Have a family meeting in which you talk about setting up technology-free times or zones. At the very least there should be no cell phones during meals or in the bedroom, but you may also want to carve out mare cell-phone-free zones for the family. A friend's wife says, "No cell phones on the couch. If you are on the couch, talk to me."
- Model healthy use of technology. For example, never text while driving. If you need to send a text while you're in the car, be sure to pull over. If you are on your phone when your child walks into the room, stop and greet him or her. If you need to check your phone for a text, e-mail, or alert, ask permission. "Is it okay if I check this? It might be Dad/I told so-and-so I would look for her message."
- Try to have at least thirty minutes of unplugged "private time" every day with your kids during the week and at least an hour a day on weekends when you don't take calls or check your phone, Consider identifying a certain period during the weekend (e.g., Sundays 9:00 AM to noon) as tech free "It's pancake, read the Times, and play a game time." Negotiate with your kids if necessary about the best time for digital downtime. If your child has difficulty letting go of her phone, let her set a timer and tell her she can check her texts every ten or fifteen minutes. Ten to fifteen minutes seems obsessive-and it is,
- in our view-but kids who have a harder time with tech-free time will resent it less if you're not rigid. Be respectful and know that even short periods of tech-free time may be hard for her.
- When out and about, point out social situations in which one person is ignoring the other through their use of a phone (bad dates, parents ignoring soccer games, concerts, Starbucks where every single person is on a phone). Ask them, "What do you think the other person is feeling?"
- If you're ready to give a younger child a phone or Internet access, study resources such as Adam Pletter's iParent101.com and the American Pediatrics Association's Media and Children Communication Toolkit to educate yourself about the games and apps your kid uses. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (esrb.org) offers useful information about setting parental controls on games. Other sources we recommend are OnGuardOnline, which offers tips for protecting your computers; Common Sense Media, which rates programs and apps, and iKeepSafe.org, a fount of information about keeping kids safe online. Above all, talk to your children and let them know that it's your job to help them learn to use technology well. Say, "There's a whole world available on this gadget. If you get into something that's scary for you, I want you to let me know."
- Let kids know you'll check their texts and Twitter page randomly until you feel they are not using it in a way that's hurtful to others or that makes them vulnerable to being hurt-and then do it.
- Make video game use contingent on not freaking out when it's time to quit.
- If your kid is using technology excessively, consider consulting with a psychologist or counselor.

#### Chapter Ten: Exercising the Brain and  Body
##### Contents
- Exercise #1: Set clear goals.
- Exercise #2: Pay attention to what your brain is telling you.
- Exercise #3: Practice Plan B thinking.
- Exercise #4: Talk to yourself with cmopassion.
- Exercise #5: Practice reframing problems.
- Exercise #6: Move your body and/or play.

##### Notes
There are empowering mental strategies that can help kids to be more successful. 
- **Set clear goals.** Goal setting helps kids be more successful at making goals happen. One goal setting method is mental contrasting: ask a child to set their own goal. Have them write down some words about the hoped-for outcome. Then have them consider the inner obstacles to that goal and write those down too, including what they can do to adjust when those obstacles surface. Kids can also focus on "personal best" goals rather than competition with others. 
- **Pat attention to the brain.** Paying attention to the brain can restore a kid's sense of control. E.g., help them understand that when they feel stressed or threatened they will have a harder time concentrating. It's especially important to help understand their brain and its patterns.
- **Practice Plan B thinking.** Help kids think through what else they could do if their plans don't work out as they hoped. This can help them deal with potential setbacks and put things in perspective. 
- **Talk to yourself with compassion.** When kids are in the mood, teach them to respond to themselves with compassion. Help them understand that they are capable and mistakes don't change that. Help them find explanations that are not threatening to their identity.
- **Practice reframing problems.** Help kids find more empowering ways to frame their situations. E.g., "I want to" instead of "I have to" or "This is annoying but it's not awful." Teach kids that *they* get to choose how they frame events and that they should choose the point of view that is most helpful. On particularly powerful question is "Is this a big problem or a little problem?" Help them understand the difference. Also teach them self-soothing mechanisms, like going to a cool-down spot or deep breathing, which can help them get the perspective to reframe.
- **Move or play.** Exercise and play help the brain work better and reduce stress (but not if they feel forced). Help kids find physically active hobbies and activities that they enjoy. 

What to do tonight (quoted):
- Consider the exercises in this chapter and ask your child if he thinks there's one that would help him, you, or the whole family.
- Have a family meeting in which you share your written goals. Ask your kids for their thoughts on your goals or those of their siblings. Validate their suggestions.
- Encourage your kids to set their own goals and to visualize achieving them. Ask, "What would you like to do or accomplish for the next week/month/ semester/ by the end of summer?" Help them make SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-Bound). When you break a goal down into discrete, actionable steps, you increase the dopamine released when they see progress.
- Build on your child's SMART goals to add in mental contrasting. Are there inner obstacles? How will your child handle it if he is thwarted? How will he feel, and how will he recuperate and move on?
- Make Plan B thinking a family practice. Ask your kids if they want to hear your thoughts about their Plan As and Bs. If they don't, back off.
- Model positive self-talk and self-compassion. You might say something like, I realized yesterday that i was being really hard on myself about something I screwed up at work, harder than I would have been on anyone else. Everyone messes things up sometimes and getting down on myself won't help me avoid mistakes.
- Make physical fitness a family value. Don't force your child to play a sport and don't choose art activity for him, but explain that it is important that everyone in the family make physical activity a part of their life and help them to decide what they would like to do.

- What to Do Tonight

##### Notes
Although it may look different in detail, self-control and autonomy are just as important for kids with learning disabilities, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorders. These kids often need special help, but they will do better if they don't feel like this help is being done *to them.* When these children are given the information they need to make a decision and don't feel forced, they are capable of choosing thoughtfully. 

What to do tonight (quoted):
- Do everything you can to minimize homework-related stress. Even if your kids have significant learning difficulties, play a consultant role. It's far more effective than that of a teacher or taskmaster.
- Offer your child as much choice as possible about the kinds of interventions he receives and when he receives them. Accept that it's okay for him to say no—or to participate in fewer of them.
- If possible, find a school that will accommodate your child, so that he doesn't feel stressed or unable to keep up.
- Encourage your child to try different ways of working and learning to figure out what works best for him. Students with special needs are often slow to develop an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and can be reluctant to use strategies that "everyone else" isn't using. Therefore, consider this a long-term goal, and keep working at it. Remind your child that "you're the expert on you" and encourage him to pay attention to what helps and what doesn't.
- Use rewards if necessary, but as much as possible provide a rationale that respects your child's autonomy. "I know that when you look at your math work sheet it's incredibly hard for you to get yourself focused enough to work on it. This is because there's not enough dopamine in the front part of your brain to make it interesting enough to focus on. I'll offer you an incentive, because it will make it easier to get your brain going. Some kids dislike homework so much that they'll turn down the incentives. if that is the case you may be able to negotiate with the school about alternatives to homework, like watching educational videos or listening to recorded books.
- If your child is in middle school or high school, advocate for a resource period or an extra study period during the day so that your child can get most of his homework done at school.
- Give your kids opportunities to serve, such as helping younger children or working with animals. This is a wonderful way for children with challenges to develop a healthy sense of control.
- Teach your children how their brains work and tell them that learning how to do something means that more and more brain cells are firing together as one unit. This is why we practice things over and over, so that we get more players on the neuron teams that do reading, math, writing, sports, and many other things.
- Talk out loud to yourself about managing situations that are hard for your kid. For instance: "When I was trying to figure out how to get everything done last night, it probably would have been better if I had written down everything I needed to do, prioritized things, and started with the most important thing. I guess I'll do that next time."
- Because kids with ADHD and ASD are at such high risk for sleep problems, pay careful attention to their ability to fall asleep, the ease with which they wake up, and the extent to which they seem tired during the day. If your child appears to have sleep problems, consult with your pediatrician and, if necessary, with a sleep specialist. Also consult an excellent book by V. Mark Durand, a psychologist and father of a child with autism, called Sleep Better! A Guide to improving Sleep for Kids with Special Needs.

#### Chapter Twelve: The SAT, ACT, and Other Four-Letter Words
##### Contents
- Testing Stinks... Usually

##### Notes
Standardized tests can be valuable when they're used as a diagnostic tools. However, they can also become stressful and high pressure. This is especially true for children who may have a learning disability but are smart and diligent enough to make up for it day-to-day. However, these tests often take on the weight of determining a kids future, and that's not healthy. The first thing parents and kids need to remember is that they don't determine your future, even when they are a sometimes necessary hurdle. 

Families can think about standardized testing through the NUTS lens of what makes things stressful:
- Novelty
- Unpredictability
- Threat to the ego
- Sense of control (or lack thereof)
- Parents: Chill out!

Tools like sample tests can reduce novelty. Learning problem solving techniques and reduce unpredictability and reinforce that the goal is to figure out an approach that gets the right answer, even if it's not the "right" one. Parents can reduce the sense of threat by emphasizing that tests do not measure intelligence, just that you know particular things. They can also encourage kids to have a "predator" mindset towards tests. Finally, parents can help kids focus on process instead of outcome when it comes to test prep to increase their sense of control. 

Finally, parents can help by chilling out. Don't put pressure on kids to take a particular test or do well. Let it be their choice and be there for them when they're stressed. 

What to do tonight (quoted):
- If your child is anxious about test taking, offer to sit in the room while they take a practice test. Read a book rather than checking e-mails.
- Talk through Plan B scenarios weeks (not the week) before a test, to help your child ward off anxiety. You might say something like, "Do you want to talk for a few minutes about ways to think about this that might make it less stressful? If what you want doesn't happen, it's not going to be a disaster. That's not the way the world works. If you're shooting for a 30 or 33 on the ACT, what would happen if you got a 28? What would happen if the college you want to go to is out of your range? Let's talk about a Plan B and let your brain know that it's not the end of the world if you don't reach your goal."
- Ask your child to think or write a paragraph about the values that are most important to her before she takes the exam. Ideally, do not ask to see it. Tell her, "This is for you alone."
- Drive your child to the testing site the week before so he can check it out. If kids can visualize the test in advance, they will feel more control over the situation when the big day comes.
- Familiarize yourself with the more than 850 test-optional colleges and universities at www.fairtest.org. Knowing that plenty of great colleges don't require standardized tests for admission can afford your son or daughter all sorts of Plan B options for college.
- Plan for your child to take the ACT or SAT more than once. Kids do better if they know they can take a mulligan.
- Know that a little stress actually helps kids perform better. But to keep an optimal amount of stress, make sleep a family priority, and talk with your kid about taking the ACT or SAT during a week when there is less going on at school and with extracurricular activities.

##### Notes
Some kids find that when they go to college, they're not ready for it. College is a completely different environment than high school, and kids need to be ready to exercise a sense of self control. This is made harder by irregular sleep schedules, less structured schedules, easy access to alcohol and technology, a harder time getting a healthy diet, and potential stimulant abuse. College is often a brain-toxic environment, and not all kids will cope well.

One way to help kids through this tumultuous time is to realize that college is not an entitlement. Parents need to expect kids to manage their own lives (and have invested in giving them the tools to do so). Parents should consider sending kids to college as an investment, and and means that parents can set requirements on their kids' performance. The chapter contains a number of questions that can help a parent assess if a child is ready for college. If you kid isn't ready, consider letting them take a gap year. When your child is ready to go to college, remember that if you are providing financial support, it's their call when to go but it's your investment, so you can define criteria they need to meet. 

What to do tonight (quoted):
- Prep early. If your child is not ready for college when she graduates in June, she's probably not going to be ready when fall semester starts. The process of encouraging readiness must begin much earlier. Start suggesting as early as ninth grade that college is something that needs to be earned. Begin to outline together the kinds of skills your child will need to develop over the next four years in order to demonstrate their readiness. Tell him you will want to see that he can basically run his own life for at least six months prior to going off to college.
- If your child wants to go to college and appears to be capable of developing college-level academic skills, but is not yet ready, emphasize that the question is one of when she'll go, not if.
- Encourage your child to get work experience. Successful job experience is a very good predictor of college success.
- If your teen is going to college soon, talk about what it will be like and what it will take for it to be a good experience. Discuss what he or she feels are the best ways for you to be supportive without being intrusive, to stay connected without hovering.
- Prepare yourself for the transition. Stay connected but keep a strong focus on your own life. Remind your child that your home will always be a base. Talk to your spouse about your changing roles.

##### Notes
Help kids understand that there is more than one route to a happy life. The way to happiness is not a narrow path that is easy to fall off of. Kids often have a distorted view of the adult world which fosters fear and competition. We need people to take different life paths, and we need kids to find and nurture their own strengths. Tell kids the truth about the world. This includes the advantages of being a good student but also the alternative paths they can take. 

"In the end, the best way you can help your child maintain a sense of control and guide him (as a nonanxious consultant) into a satisfying life is to teach him to ask himself two questions: What do I truly love to do? And what can I do better than most people?"

What to do tonight (quoted):
- Make a list with your child of all the different jobs you can possibly think of together. Not jobs either one of you would necessarily be interested in-just jobs that someone is doing. What might those people like about their jobs? What might they be good at?
- Share the stories of alternate routes from this chapter with your child. Tell him or her others you know of, and ask if he or she knows of any.
- Be open about the surprises or disappointments you encountered on your own path, or that your parents or grandparents did, and how you pivoted. Ned's great-grandfather made and lost a fortune in the stock market, and went from the biggest house in town to a small apartment and back again. Knowing that even successful people have ups and downs helped give Ned perspective, as did understanding that resilience was a family tradition.
- Ask your child, What do you love to do? What do you think you're better at than other people? Do you want my view?
- Ask your child, What contributions do you think you would like to make to the world around you? What steps might you take to get there?
- Encourage your child to find a mentor, someone whose life they admire and who can help guide them. Kids will often be more open to guidance from someone who is not their parent.

#### Onward

##### Notes
Reiterates the theme of the book: it takes courage to trust a child to make decisions and face our fears about the future. It takes humility to accept that we don't always know what's in our kids best interests. Helping children be self-driven is just as much about changing the mindset of parents as enabling kids. Don't focus on being perfect. Focus on helping your child feel loved, trusted, supported, and capable. 

### Assistant - 2024-04-08 16:05:38

_The Self-Driven Child_ by William Stixrud and Ned Johnson explores the critical concept of fostering a healthy sense of control in children, emphasizing that such autonomy is linked to numerous positive outcomes including better health, academic success, and happiness. The authors argue against a controlling parenting style, advocating instead for parents to act as consultants, encouraging independence and allowing children to make their own decisions. This approach, they assert, equips children with the resilience and self-motivation needed to navigate life’s challenges effectively.

The detrimental impact of chronic stress on young minds is thoroughly examined, with the book highlighting the importance of differentiating between positive, tolerable, and toxic stress. Strixrud and Johnson provide practical strategies for parents to help their children manage stress healthily, thereby enhancing their capacity to cope and build resilience. The emphasis is on teaching children to face and grow from mildly stressful situations rather than shielding them from all forms of stress.

Central to the book is the concept of autonomy, which is deemed essential for children's development into self-motivated and resilient individuals. Parents are encouraged to allow their children the freedom to make choices, learn from failures, and understand the consequences of their actions within safe boundaries. This involves reframing the parent-child dynamic, moving away from control and towards guidance, and recognizing the importance of safety in matters such as addiction and self-harm.

The book also addresses the challenges of the digital age, acknowledging the difficulties in balancing technological benefits with its potential to detract from valuable life experiences. Strategies for managing technology use in a way that maintains a child's sense of control and promotes healthy development are discussed. Furthermore, the narrative extends beyond childhood, considering readiness for college and alternative paths, thus respecting individual timelines and acknowledging that success and happiness can be achieved through various routes.

In conclusion, _The Self-Driven Child_ offers a compelling and practical guide for parents seeking to nurture independence and resilience in their children. By advocating for a shift in parental perspective from control to consultancy, Stixrud and Johnson provide valuable insights and strategies to help children thrive in an increasingly complex world. The book stands as a testament to the importance of empowering children with the autonomy to steer their own lives towards success and fulfillment.
