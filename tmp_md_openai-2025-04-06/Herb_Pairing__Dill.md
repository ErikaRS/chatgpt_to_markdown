What herb might go well with a baked polenta with fontina, Calabrian chili sauce, and lox?

Fresh dill would be a good choice. Its unique flavor would complement the creaminess of the fontina cheese and the heat from the Calabrian chili sauce, while also pairing well with the salty, smoky lox. Additionally, dill is often used in Scandinavian cuisine where smoked fish like lox is common, so it's a natural pairing.

Sure, here are three more herbs that could complement your dish:

1. Parsley: It has a light, fresh flavor that would contrast nicely with the richness of the cheese and the heat of the chili sauce. It's also commonly used in Italian cooking, which would tie in well with the polenta.

2. Thyme: Its subtle, earthy flavor could balance out the more assertive flavors of the chili sauce and lox. Thyme is quite versatile and pairs well with a wide variety of dishes.

3. Chives: They offer a mild onion-like flavor that would work well with the lox and add a bit of freshness to the dish. The bright green color would also provide a nice visual contrast.
