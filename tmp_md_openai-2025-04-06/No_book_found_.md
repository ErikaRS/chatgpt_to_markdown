Summarize Kathleen Stock 's book material girls

### Assistant - 2023-05-29 17:09:04

I'm sorry, but as of my training data cutoff in September 2021, there's no record of a book called "Material Girls" by Kathleen Stock. Kathleen Stock is a British philosopher and professor who is known for her work in philosophy of fiction, philosophy of imagination, and feminist philosophy. If she has published this book after my last update in September 2021, I won't be able to provide a summary. Please consult the most recent sources for an accurate summary of the book "Material Girls".
