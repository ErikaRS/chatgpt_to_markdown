I am going to write a flux book for your shelf for "Playing to win". Start by describing the format of these pieces

The format of pieces for a FLUX-inspired shelf, such as "Playing to Win," is typically a blend of strategic insight, critical analysis, and a focus on actionable frameworks. Here's a potential structure based on FLUX principles:

1. **Title and Hook**: A compelling title that encapsulates the central idea or strategic angle of the piece. Begin with a strong hook or anecdote to draw in readers.

2. **Context and Framing**: Introduce the central question or challenge the piece addresses. Relate it to broader trends or frameworks, providing historical or theoretical grounding.

3. **Core Narrative or Case Study**: Dive into the key theme, often illustrated through examples, case studies, or vivid scenarios that make the strategic principles tangible.

4. **Lenses and Frameworks**: Introduce specific FLUX lenses or tools (e.g., systems thinking, adaptability, antifragility) to dissect the problem and propose approaches to address it.

5. **Actionable Insights**: Offer clear, actionable takeaways or principles, ensuring they are applicable to both individual and organizational contexts.

6. **Reflective Questions**: Conclude with thought-provoking questions or provocations, encouraging readers to consider how the insights apply to their own challenges or opportunities.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular element for your piece?

Now adapt this review I wrote to a FLUX "book for your shelf" summary

I really enjoyed this book's combination of concrete examples and a simple, applicable framework. While the examples from Procter & Gamble were from a scale not applicable to most companies, the relatable domains (beauty, household care, etc.) made the examples easy to follow and extract the key ideas from.

What makes the framework powerful is that it's focused around a set of five key questions, and even if you remember nothing but the questions themselves, you'll likely be in a better place strategically than you were before.

What is your winning aspiration? This question focuses on defining what success means for the organization. It goes beyond just financial goals, challenging leaders to envision how their business will win in its market by uniquely meeting consumer needs. The goal needs to be to win. It's not enough to "play to play". Playing to win forces you to make the hard choices it takes to create an effective strategy.

Where will you play? And where will you not play? Identifying your "playing field" involves making explicit choices about markets, customer segments, geographies, or product types to prioritize. Equally important is deciding where not to compete, ensuring resources are focused effectively.

How will you win? The "how-to-win" question emphasizes the need for a clear, competitive advantage, whether through cost leadership, differentiation, or other means. It demands a coherent plan for delivering superior value to customers.

Up until this point, the components have been somewhat obvious. The last two questions make the critical connection between high level strategy and execution.

What capabilities must be in place? Success hinges on building and sustaining unique capabilities—systems, skills, and assets—that reinforce your where-to-play and how-to-win choices. These capabilities are the "reinforcing rods" that run through and strengthen the organization. They should apply across the organization, not just within particular lines of business. The efficiencies and benefits of shared capabilities are what make it valuable to have different areas be part of the the same overall business.

What management systems are required to enable these capabilities and support these choices? Strategy execution requires robust management systems that foster key capabilities, align objectives across levels, and enable ongoing refinement of strategic choices. The discussion of this question goes into how.

The last couple of chapters contain some advice on how to put these into practice. Think Through Strategy sets out a set of 7 questions which help you analyze your industry and your position in it.

The chapter Shorten Your Odds is my favorite and would have made the book worth reading even if I hadn't enjoyed the rest (which I did). It talks about a method for generating strategy and getting buy-in that focuses on a participatory process that focuses on key constraints. In this process you:
Frame the choice: What is the concrete, meaningful decision you are making? Is everyone aligned on the choice framing?

Generate strategic possibilities: What is a wide range of possibilities, including those that seem unrealistic? The goal is to find ones that are meaningfully different from each other.

Specify conditions for success: For each possibility, what critical conditions must be true for it to succeed? Be sure to separate what must be true from what you'd like to be true.

Identify barriers to choice: What concerns do people have? What conditions do people think are least likely to hold true?

Design valid tests and conduct them: Design ways to test the critical conditions. Start with the highest risk ones. Have the skeptics lead the testing process. They'll push the hardest, and it will help with their buy in.

Make the choice: At this point, you'll have a lot of insight into what strategies are viable and their trade-offs. So decide!

Overall, this was an excellent read if you're looking for a general strategy framework that can scale up and scale down. It is not the whole answer. It should be coupled with resources that help you think through the specific strategic choices for your field and company stage, e.g., a tech startup isn't going to look like P&G. However, having a general framework that can be applied across a range of situations is a valuable shortcut for getting started with strategy in any situation.
