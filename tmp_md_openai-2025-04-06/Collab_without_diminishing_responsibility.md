I'm talking about how someone collaborates without giving up too much responsibility. The sentence I am trying to write is "They are collaborative without _____ing too much responsibility." The word I'm trying to remember starts with a 'd'. It's not delegating. What else might it be.

The word you might be looking for could be "diminishing." The sentence would then read: "They are collaborative without diminishing too much responsibility." This means that while they work well with others, they do not reduce their own level of responsibility in the process.

Give me a few other options?

Certainly, here are a few other options for the sentence:

- "They are collaborative without **divesting** too much responsibility."
- "They are collaborative without **diluting** too much responsibility."
- "They are collaborative without **disclaiming** too much responsibility."
- "They are collaborative without **dispersing** too much responsibility."

Each of these words carries a slightly different connotation but fits the context of maintaining responsibility while collaborating.
