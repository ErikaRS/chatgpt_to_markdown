I am working on a LinkedIn post to share an "EM, Platform" role. The role description is below. After I share that I will share the current draft post. 

Why this job is exciting
At Sourcegraph, we see code syncing & storage, code search, and the code graph as big data challenges. We handle tasks like indexing multi-terabyte monorepos, querying and searching clusters of hundreds of thousands of repos, providing fast & high-quality ranking, and extracting a code graph which is used throughout our products. 

As Engineering Manager, Platform, you‚Äôll utilize both your leadership skills and technical acumen. You will be instrumental in propelling Sourcegraph‚Äôs Code Search product to become the ‚ÄúGoogle of Code Search‚Äù. You will help support Cody  to become the top AI coding assistant. You will lead a team of high-agency, self-directed team mates and  will have opportunities to dive in and be deeply technical yourself. You will report directly into the Head of Engineering - Search & Foundations. 

Your deep experience in high-scale sharded-computation will help us define the scalability story for our source code syncing and search engine. Your experience in programming language tooling will help us extract a code graph that can be used to power a platform that drives everything from search and navigation to providing the best context for an LLM.

üìÖ Within one month, you will‚Ä¶

Take responsibility for three distributed, FAANG-bar teams, roughly nine engineers, and lead them as a front-line manager. Your organization will grow as the company grows.
Work closely with other Engineering department heads on cross-functional initiatives that touch Code Search and Cody.
üìÖ Within three months, you will‚Ä¶

Identify any gaps you see in the Engineering org and help address them in an appropriate way, bringing prior experience to bear in recommending and driving solutions.
Build a variety of systems, many of which are systems that you yourself may already know we need, and are not listed here. A few examples include:
a hybrid search architecture which combines modern ML and traditional search techniques for natural language search
extending our code graph to cover an ever growing set of languages with every easier configuration
a scalable system for syncing any type of data relevant for Cody or Code Search data
üìÖ Within six months, you will‚Ä¶

Champion customer engagement in all phases of design, development and deployment.
üìÖ Within one year, you will‚Ä¶

Have hired and retained exceptional people to make our team even more representative of the world‚Äôs population.
Collaborate with product and engineering leadership to develop the next set of ambitious goals that your org should work towards.
Develop a clear technical and execution strategy to achieve that next set of goals.
About you
You are a technical, customer-driven manager who works from a place of compassion and curiosity. You have experience working with highly technical customers across business sectors. You can work across departments to align requirements and priorities from a broad set of engineering, product, and business stakeholders. You are strongly aligned with our values, inspired by our mission to make it so that everyone can code, and motivated to do your best work at Sourcegraph.

You find joy in solving complex technical problems at scale. You have personal domain expertise with more than one of distributed systems, search and indexing, or programming language tooling such as compilers, build tools, static/semantic analysis, or language servers. You may not code everyday, but you are eager to jump into the code for anything from answering a customer question to fixing a bug to adding some new functionality. 

Qualifications:

You have at least 4 years of experience managing engineering teams and 5 years of hands-on coding experience.You have held a high technical bar for teammates as well as yourself.
You have relevant domain knowledge and experience in one or more of the following areas: distributed systems, search and indexing, or compilers and language tools
You can work effectively across multiple programming languages with and without prior experience.
You share our values, and work in accordance with those values.
Nice to haves:

You have worked with search quality
You have experience with machine learning
You have worked with technologies such as Go, git, Kubernetes, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, AWS, GCP (or equivalent).

Here is the current draft linkedin post. The goal is to get people interested on clicking the link to the EM, Platform position. However, I want it to come across as authentic, not too much like a marketing piece. Please give feedback on whether or not this draft meets the goals. (The current revised draft that you generated was too marketing oriented for my taste.)

Thank you for clarifying your preferences. Your draft has an authentic tone and provides a clear overview of the role. Here are some minor modifications to help enhance clarity and authenticity without sounding too marketing-oriented:

Hey folks, Sourcegraph has opened up a role that I'm genuinely excited to share.

We're on the lookout for an **EM, Platform** - someone who would manage 3 distinct teams encompassing roughly 10 engineers. This position is pivotal as it involves providing both technical and managerial direction to teams integral to the essence of Sourcegraph's Code AI Platform. This spans tasks like ingesting source code from various hosts, to processing that very data to empower our Code Search and the Cody AI coding assistant.

Considering the breadth of responsibilities this team handles, we're keen on connecting with individuals who've dabbled in more than one domain like distributed systems, search and indexing, or programming language tooling. Even better if you've got deep expertise in any of them.

And, a heads-up, Sourcegraph operates entirely remotely. 

If this resonates or if you're curious about the specifics, feel free to drop a comment or message me directly. I'm here to help!

This version maintains the authenticity of your original draft while offering a slightly more conversational tone.
