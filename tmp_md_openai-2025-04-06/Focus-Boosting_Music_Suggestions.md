Certainly, the type of music that encourages productivity can be very subjective and can depend greatly on personal preference. Here are a few genres and specific suggestions within each that could be suitable for writing performance reviews. They all have the potential to enhance focus and provide an energizing atmosphere:

1. **Classical Music**: Classical music is well-known to boost concentration and mental performance. 

   - Mozart: "Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major, K. 467: II. Andante"
   - Bach: "Brandenburg Concerto No. 3"
   - Beethoven: "Symphony No. 9"
   - Debussy: "Clair de Lune"

2. **Soundtracks**: Many movie scores and video game soundtracks are designed to provide an emotional backdrop while not distracting from the action or dialogue. 

   - Hans Zimmer: "Time" (from Inception), "Interstellar Main Theme"
   - Max Richter: "On the Nature of Daylight"
   - Ramin Djawadi: "Light of the Seven" (from Game of Thrones)
   - The "Stardew Valley" or "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" video game soundtracks

3. **Lo-fi beats**: This genre has been praised for its relaxing and focus-enhancing effects. Lo-fi beats generally have a chill and relaxed tempo which may help to maintain a steady workflow.

   - Artists like Jinsang, [bsd.u], and Idealism have plenty of tracks to choose from. 
   - Also consider the popular "lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to" stream on YouTube.

4. **Ambient Music**: This style of music is designed to be soothing and non-intrusive.

   - Brian Eno: "Music for Airports"
   - Moby: "Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep."
   - Stars Of The Lid: "...and Their Refinement Of The Decline"

5. **Electronica / Chill EDM**: Electronic music with a steady, but not too aggressive beat can be very motivating.

   - Tycho: "Dive", "Awake"
   - Odesza: "A Moment Apart", "Bloom"
   - Bonobo: "Black Sands", "Migration"

6. **Jazz**: Soft, mellow jazz can create a relaxed yet energizing environment. 

   - Dave Brubeck: "Take Five"
   - Miles Davis: "Blue in Green"
   - John Coltrane: "In A Sentimental Mood"
  
Remember to try out different styles and artists to see what works best for you. Some people prefer instrumental music to prevent lyrics from becoming a distraction, while others find any kind of background noise to be a distraction. There are numerous streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube where you can explore these genres and artists.
