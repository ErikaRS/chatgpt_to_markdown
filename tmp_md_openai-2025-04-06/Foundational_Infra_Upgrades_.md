We have a project called "Embedding infrastructure optimizations" but optimizations sounds small scale. What's a better name for an infrastructure project that indicates that the work is pretty fundamental but doesn't have user visible changes?

A better name for an infrastructure project that indicates its fundamental nature without implying small scale or user-visible changes could be:

"Foundational Infrastructure Enhancements" 

or

"Core Infrastructure Upgrades" 

These names convey the importance of the project and its impact on the underlying infrastructure while avoiding the notion of just minor or incremental optimizations. They suggest that the work involves significant improvements to the foundational aspects of the system without directly implying any specific changes that users might notice.
