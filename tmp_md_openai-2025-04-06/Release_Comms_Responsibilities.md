Make this more crisp and concise:

What sort of customer comms do we usually draft for releases? The ones I've seen have mostly been in the context of a particular change (e.g., postgres16) and have been drafted by someone more involved in that project. For those sorts of things, I would say Ron would be responsible for making sure they happen but not necessarily the writing. But if there are general release comms we have, then yes, I'd like Ron to draft those.

For blog posts, I'd still like marketing and dev rel to be responsible for those, but with the separation between marketing moments and monthly releases, I think we should have less of those? The way I'm thinking about it is that for the monthly release by default we'll only have the changelogs and the internal enablement, no blog posts. And if marketing thinks it's the right time for a blog post, they can decide to have one. 

For monthly enablement, yes, that is what I'd like to see. We'd want to have some transition period so Ron can get mentored up to speed... and we wouldn't want to change any of this until after Jan 29th. 

What do you think?

Sure thing, here's a more concise version:

---

What customer communications do we typically draft for releases? Most I've seen are specific to a change (e.g., Postgres 16) and written by someone close to the project. In those cases, Ron would ensure they happen, but not necessarily write them. If there are general release comms, though, I'd like Ron to draft those.

For blog posts, I'd still prefer marketing and dev rel to own those. With the distinction between marketing moments and monthly releases, I expect fewer overall. By default, monthly releases will only include changelogs and internal enablementâ€”no blog posts unless marketing decides otherwise.

For monthly enablement, yes, I'd like Ron to take that on. We should allow a transition period for mentoring, and no changes until after Jan 29th.

Thoughts?
