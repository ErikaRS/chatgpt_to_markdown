An artisanal marshmallow typically stands out due to several key characteristics:

1. **Quality Ingredients**: Artisanal marshmallows are made with high-quality, often natural ingredients, such as real cane sugar, organic gelatin, and natural flavorings and colorings, avoiding artificial additives and preservatives.

2. **Handcrafted Process**: The production process is usually done by hand in small batches, ensuring attention to detail and quality control.

3. **Unique Flavors**: They often come in a variety of unique and gourmet flavors that you wouldn't typically find in mass-produced marshmallows. These can include flavors like lavender, matcha, espresso, or exotic fruits.

4. **Texture**: Artisanal marshmallows tend to have a superior texture, being softer, fluffier, and more melt-in-your-mouth compared to their commercial counterparts.

5. **Aesthetic Appeal**: They often have an appealing presentation, sometimes decorated or cut into unique shapes, making them visually attractive as well as tasty.

6. **Personal Touch**: Many artisanal marshmallow makers put a personal touch into their products, such as customized packaging or limited edition seasonal flavors.

These elements combine to create a premium product that offers a distinctive experience compared to standard, mass-produced marshmallows.
