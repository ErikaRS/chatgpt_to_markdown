I know it's important to not fall prey to the innovator's dilemma. But is it doing that if you insist that the innovation have a legit business model? In it's own right not relative to the profit structure of the existing business.

You're asking a very sharp and nuanced question, and you're absolutely right to want to separate the idea of *avoiding the innovator's dilemma* from *blindly pursuing innovation without a business model*. Let's unpack it.

### **Core Concepts at Play**

**The Innovator’s Dilemma**, as coined by Clayton Christensen, warns established businesses against dismissing disruptive innovations because:
- They start with lower margins or niche markets,
- They don’t fit the profit model or scale of the current business, and
- They may cannibalize the existing business.

But—and this is key—the point of Christensen’s warning isn't *“pursue innovation no matter what”*, it's *“don’t evaluate disruptive innovation using the same success metrics as the core business.”* That doesn’t mean "ignore business viability."

---

### **So is it the Innovator’s Dilemma to insist on a standalone business model?**

Not necessarily. In fact, it's *not* falling into the dilemma **if your requirement is that the innovation has a real business model of its own, just not the same one as your legacy business.** Here's the nuance:

- **Healthy discipline:** Requiring a business model ensures you're not chasing tech for tech’s sake or burning cash without a path to sustainability.
- **What *would* be a mistake:** Dismissing the innovation because it doesn't meet the margins, scale, or sales motion of the core business. That’s the heart of the dilemma.
- **What’s *not* a mistake:** Saying, “This can have lower margins, a long tail, or serve a different customer—but it still needs to work economically in that context.”

---

### **Examples of the distinction:**
- **Kodak's error** wasn’t that it insisted on profit—it was that it ignored digital photography because it couldn't deliver film-like profits.
- **Amazon Web Services** didn’t fit Amazon’s core retail model—but it had its own business logic and was allowed to flourish separately.
- **Google X / Alphabet** is an experiment in separating the "new bets" structurally so they’re not judged by core search business metrics.

---

### **Helpful Framing:**
You might ask:
- Can this innovation sustain itself, even if the scale or economics are different?
- Are we insisting on *legitimacy* of the business model—or *equivalence* to our current one?
- Are we open to incubation or alternative paths to profitability?

---

### **Quick Summary**
You’re *not* falling into the innovator’s dilemma if you:
- Require the new thing to have a viable business model **on its own terms**, not those of the core business.
- Avoid judging the innovation by core metrics like margin, TAM, or sales motion too early.
- Protect it from premature optimization or integration pressure.

---

**Reflection Reminder:**  
Later, reflect on how your own company makes space for new ideas. Do you have ways to explore alternative models without expecting them to “prove themselves” too early? And what implicit pressures might still be tying new ideas to old expectations?

What are things to consider when looking at a low profit margin new innovation? In this case, something subject to a usage based pricing model where most of the profit goes to an underlying service provider?

### Assistant - 2025-03-21 19:31:00

Great, you’re zeroing in on one of the trickiest but most relevant categories of innovation today—products built on top of commoditized or third-party infrastructure (e.g. APIs, LLMs, cloud compute) where you capture value through **usage-based pricing**, but the margin is low because much of that revenue flows out.

Here’s a framework to evaluate and engage with this kind of innovation wisely:

---

### **1. Value Capture vs. Value Creation**
- **Who’s creating value?** You might be creating a lot of value through orchestration, UX, integration, etc.
- **But can you capture it?** If the innovation sits close to the customer but far from the core infrastructure, there’s room to *create* value even with slim margins—*if* you can eventually capture value through bundling, network effects, or switching costs.

---

### **2. Cost Structure Flexibility**
- **Is the underlying cost variable or fixed?** If you pay per usage and charge per usage, your margins are thin but predictable. If you *pre-commit* (e.g. pre-purchased tokens or compute), you may get better margins but take on risk.
- **Is there room for volume discounts or vertical integration over time?** For instance, could you negotiate rates or eventually own part of the stack (e.g. run your own model or infra)?

---

### **3. Strategic Leverage**
Low-margin innovations can be acceptable—even *desirable*—if they unlock something else:
- **Distribution:** Does it grow your user base or ecosystem?
- **Data moat:** Does it generate proprietary data, workflows, or usage patterns?
- **Platform extension:** Does it enhance your broader platform, even if it’s not profitable in isolation?

Think of these like a *“loss-leader” with optionality*.

---

### **4. Customer Stickiness and Switching Costs**
If your margins are low, you need:
- High customer retention (so you earn back your CAC),
- Friction to switching (custom workflows, integrations, embedded data),
- Or extremely low CAC and viral growth.

Otherwise, you’re just handing margin to your infra providers and churning users before they become profitable.

---

### **5. Optionality and Future Margin Expansion**
A thin-margin business today might be the foundation for:
- **Upsells** (support, compliance, integrations),
- **Cross-sells** (related products with better margins),
- **Control over infra** (e.g. train your own model, host your own service),
- **Bundling power** (especially if you're already a platform business).

---

### **6. Market Timing and Competitive Pressure**
- **Are you early enough to build a lead before margins compress further?**
- **Are others getting better rates or infra access than you?**
- **Can you build a moat before commodification drives down prices even more?**

Sometimes low-margin today is a sign of being early—other times, it means you’re standing in a narrowing corridor.

---

### **7. Pricing Power**
Even if the core costs are high:
- Can you charge for *value*, not just throughput?
- Can you create tiers, bundles, SLAs, or usage patterns that shift the margin profile?

Usage-based pricing is *not* the same as value-based pricing—can you build bridges between the two?

---

### **8. Brand, Trust, and Differentiation**
In markets with thin margins, trust and brand become huge differentiators. If you can become *the* provider people trust to do this well (securely, reliably, ethically), you can build loyalty even when the tech is easy to replicate.

---

### **Questions to Ask Yourself**
- What is the *real differentiator* here—experience, integration, trust, data, community?
- Could this become high-margin at scale, or is it permanently low-margin?
- Is it strategically important enough to accept low margins now?
- What downstream or adjacent revenue could it enable?
- Are we optimizing too soon—or ignoring margin risk too long?

---

**Reflection Reminder:**  
Later, take a moment to think about how your company treats these types of ideas. Are they being evaluated only by near-term ROI, or are you explicitly modeling their strategic value, optionality, and longer-term leverage points? Where can you build scaffolding to protect and evolve them over time?

Talk to me more about value based pricing, especially for developer tools

### Assistant - 2025-03-21 19:33:54

Absolutely. Value-based pricing is especially powerful (and tricky) in the world of developer tools, where your users are technical, price-sensitive, and often have high expectations for performance, reliability, and transparency. Let’s break it down with the context and nuance you’re looking for.

---

## **What is Value-Based Pricing?**

At its core, **value-based pricing** means pricing your product according to the **value it delivers to the customer**, rather than your cost or the competition’s price. 

- In developer tools, this might mean charging more for:
  - Time saved (faster debugging, testing, deployment)
  - Increased productivity (fewer bugs, smoother onboarding)
  - Risk reduction (compliance, security)
  - Competitive advantage (faster feature delivery)

---

## **Why It’s Hard in Dev Tools**

1. **Your user ≠ your buyer**
   - Devs care about performance, usability, and trust.
   - Buyers (team leads, VPs, procurement) care about ROI, velocity, risk mitigation.
   - Your pricing has to bridge that gap—ideally tying back to *business outcomes* rather than raw functionality.

2. **Dev tools often feel like “should be free” infra**
   - Especially if you’re a CLI, SDK, API wrapper, etc.
   - To escape the commodity trap, your product needs a compelling narrative about **why your value is not just engineering hygiene, but business leverage.**

3. **High expectations for transparency and fairness**
   - Usage-based pricing can feel punitive if it scales unpredictably or charges for “dead weight.”
   - Flat pricing can feel wrong if small teams subsidize large ones.
   - Devs will reverse-engineer your pricing and argue with you on GitHub if it feels wrong.

---

## **Levers for Value-Based Pricing in Dev Tools**

Here are **8 value levers** you can use to align pricing with perceived value:

### 1. **Time Saved**
- Devs are expensive. If you can save a senior dev an hour a week, that’s real money.
- E.g., **CI/CD tools** like CircleCI or Buildkite often price based on build concurrency—because more concurrency = faster builds = time saved.

### 2. **Shift-Left Risk Management**
- Security tools (like Snyk) or observability platforms (like Datadog) can charge based on **risk reduction** or faster MTTR.
- This is a value lever for decision-makers, even if devs are the users.

### 3. **Business Impact / Throughput**
- Think about how your tool contributes to **faster releases, more stable systems, higher feature throughput**.
- Tools like LaunchDarkly (feature flags) or Split.io often sell on this basis: *"We help you ship faster and safer."*

### 4. **Usage-Based as a Proxy for Value**
- If you’re an API or infrastructure tool, you might price per request, per GB, or per token.
- This can *approximate* value—but it can backfire if the correlation isn’t clear. (e.g., “Why did I get a $3,000 bill for a dev mistake?”)

### 5. **Team Productivity / Collaboration**
- Tools like GitHub, Linear, or Notion price per seat because the more people use it, the more value the org gets.
- But beware: if only some devs use the tool actively, seat-based pricing can feel unfair.

### 6. **Data Insights / Analytics**
- Tools like Datadog, Honeycomb, or Amplitude can charge for observability or analytics *per event*, but back it with dashboards, alerting, and usage insights that justify the cost.
- These feel more justified when they *reduce toil or decision risk*.

### 7. **Differentiated Experience**
- Dev tools with slick UIs, fast feedback loops, great DX (developer experience) can charge more even for similar functionality.
- If you solve a painful problem *gracefully*, you can capture emotional and experiential value.

### 8. **Compliance and Enterprise Features**
- RBAC, SSO, audit logs, SLA support, and integrations often justify pricing tiers.
- Not because of marginal cost, but because of perceived business value and reduced procurement friction.

---

## **Tactics for Moving Toward Value-Based Pricing**

- **Interview customers** to understand what they *really* value and what outcomes matter to them.
- **Run pricing experiments**—test different packaging, metering, and bundles.
- **Use proxy metrics** if value isn’t directly measurable (e.g., # of deployments as a proxy for team productivity).
- **Educate your customers** on the value you provide. Don’t just list features—connect them to outcomes.
- **Align tiers to outcomes**, not usage. E.g., instead of “Pro gets more users,” try “Pro helps teams manage change at scale.”

---

## **What to Watch Out For**

- **Misaligned incentives**: E.g., metering by API calls may disincentivize adoption or lead to bizarre workarounds.
- **Opaque pricing**: Devs hate not knowing what something costs or fearing unexpected bills.
- **Too granular metering**: If billing is unpredictable or hard to model, it creates anxiety and churn.

---

## **Final Thought: What's the Customer Buying?**

They’re not buying “tool that integrates with GitHub.”

They’re buying:
- *Faster pull requests and code reviews*
- *Happier devs with fewer context switches*
- *More secure software with less manual effort*
- *Insight into what's slowing down deploys*

**Price that. Not just the tool.**

---

**Reflection Reminder:**  
Afterward, reflect on how your current or future dev tool connects its pricing to the value users and buyers actually perceive. Are you charging for what you can meter, or for what your customer truly cares about? Where could you shift your model to better reflect outcomes and avoid pricing traps?
