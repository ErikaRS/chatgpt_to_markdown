What is the name of a narrative structure where the chapters are episodic but there's an overall plot slowly advancing, sometimes in the background. Little Women, the Little House books, and the Betsy Tacy books are examples

The narrative structure you're describing is often referred to as "episodic with an overarching narrative" or "serial narrative structure." This means that while each chapter or episode is self-contained with its own conflict and resolution, there is also a larger story arc that develops throughout the series. This type of structure allows for individual stories to be enjoyed on their own, while also building a larger, more complex narrative over time.
