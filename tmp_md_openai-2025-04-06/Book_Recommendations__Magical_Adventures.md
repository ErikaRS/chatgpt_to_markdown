Here are some with a more extensive world-building:

6. **The Tiffany Aching series by Terry Pratchett** - Set within the Discworld universe, Tiffany's adventures as a young witch offer both depth and humor in terms of world-building.

7. **The Green Rider series by Kristen Britain** - The story of Karigan G'ladheon, a messenger of the king, set in the deeply constructed world of Sacoridia.
