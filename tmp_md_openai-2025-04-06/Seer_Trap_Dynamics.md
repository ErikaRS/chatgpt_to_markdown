Let's write this up as a FLUX piece. As usual, to make a negative lens feel less accussatory, try to use "we" language instead of "you" language. Also, focus on the broader system dynamics more than the individual issues

Prompt:
I want to stress test an idea against this group before I write it up: a pattern I have sometimes noticed is that when a leader has a fixed mindset attitude it can have the pernicious consequence that they don't care about trying to bring people along because they divide the world into people who either get it or don't get it... and if you don't get it you're not worth their time. 

Does this resonate with anyone else? 

(Also welcome: suggestions for writing this up without it feeling like it's targeting anyone 🙃😭😝)

Response:
Yes, I’ve seen this in product ops where people tell me to implement a process because “people just have to do it.” This then forces people to comply or get in trouble. I’d say this is similar.

Response:
It fits nicely into the missionaries versus mercenaries distinction: leaders feel they don't have to convince the true believers because they "just get it" whilst the mercenaries are always quibbling about details. The leaders don't realise that they tend to retrospectively slot people into those missionary/mercenary categories based on whether they agree and automatically comply.

Response: 
I’ll admit to falling into this trap when I perceive stark differences in n-ply thinking especially in a group setting. Based on my skills of persuasion, group/individual openness and the amount of time on hand, I may choose to stay mum on a subject and bide my time. My energy conservation and threat minimizing heuristics aren’t always aligned perfectly with far-sighted self-interest.

Response: 
Reflecting on this a bit more, the analogy that is salient for me is the "Seer" role in a game of Werewolf (or a "Detective" role in Mafia). This is also explored in José Saramago's Blindness. 

When you see more clearly in the distance, at deeper n-plies, or detect truth among a mob of obliviousness, it is generally wise in early game to deny your role and blend in with the other sheep because you know there are wolves in sheep's clothing, and those loyal to them, among the herd. Often the key decision in a game of Werewolf is when to use and reveal the Seer role to maximum effect. It is a tricky role, often quite challenging for newbs. 

I've played Werewolf but there are days when I still feel like a newb. And of course, not all rooms have a Werewolf/Mafia King. Your strategy tips welcomed. 🙂

Response: 
This resonates. My reaction to this is usually based on whether the leader is trying to be ‘right’ or find people to empirically test the belief through doing. 

Having a (grounded) vision with some conviction is useful, and you need a minimal coalition of believers to actualize + test an idea (and it’s a potential trap to engage/convince too many in abstract before testing). Ie: strong convictions, loosely held.

The ‘not worth their time’ attitude definitely strikes me as pernicious— ideological or ego.

Absolutely—this thread is rich, and it really sings with that FLUX-y tension between system coherence and emergent complexity. Here's a working draft of a piece that captures the core pattern, defuses the blame, and reframes the issue systemically, all in that classic FLUX style.

---

**🌀 The Seer Trap**

Sometimes, the belief in a “fixed mindset” doesn’t just limit growth—it subtly distorts how we engage with others. We’ve noticed a pattern: when a leader (or any of us, really) divides the world into those who “get it” and those who don’t, it often leads to a kind of disengagement from the work of alignment. It becomes easy—seductive even—to believe that persuasion is a waste of time, and that those who don’t immediately agree simply aren’t worth the energy.

We’ve seen this most acutely in situations where conviction runs high. Sometimes it sounds like: *“people just need to do it.”* Sometimes it looks like defaulting to silent frustration, opting out of the hard work of co-creating understanding because the cost feels too high. And sometimes it plays out as the missionary/mercenary divide—where allegiance is judged less by curiosity or contribution, and more by compliance.

At its root, this isn’t about bad intentions. It’s a systems pattern.

The belief that people either “get it or don’t” often correlates with a kind of intellectual seerhood—an ability to perceive patterns or long-range consequences that others might not yet see. In high-complexity environments, we naturally develop heuristics to protect our energy: conserve effort, minimize risk, avoid becoming the lightning rod. But in doing so, we can sometimes overfit on alignment, and underinvest in sensemaking.

And when these dynamics play out at scale—across a team, an org, a movement—we can fall into a kind of epistemic stratification. A sorting mechanism emerges: insiders and outsiders, visionaries and blockers. Trust becomes a filter bubble. Disagreement is interpreted as inadequacy.

What we lose in this mode is the middle ground—the possibility that someone might not *yet* see what we see, but could, if invited into the frame with care.

In game-theory terms, it's the Werewolf “Seer” dilemma: when to speak, when to withhold, and how to act when you sense danger—but can’t be sure who’s who. The risk is real. But so is the responsibility.

If there’s a gentle challenge here, it’s this: How might we design systems that support conviction *and* sensemaking? How do we stay open to the possibility that “getting it” isn’t a binary switch, but a process—a collective one?

Great call. Kicking things off with a tangible scenario can ground the pattern in something familiar and visceral—makes the systemic dynamics easier to feel *before* we explain them.

Here’s a revised draft with a new opening vignette, plus a few title ideas at the end to spark some riffing:

---

**🌀 Dismissal as a Design Pattern**  
*(alt titles below)*

You're in a meeting. A leader introduces a new direction—bold, strategic, maybe even visionary. Someone asks a clarifying question. It’s a fair question, but the leader brushes it off with a vague “you’ll get it once we’re further along.” A few people nod, trying to show alignment. Others stay quiet. The tension doesn’t explode—but it congeals. Over the next few weeks, energy subtly fractures. Those who “get it” are brought closer. Those who didn’t quite vibe? Marginalized, sometimes without even realizing it.

This is a pattern we’ve seen across roles and orgs: when conviction hardens into sorting, and complexity gets flattened into a binary—those who *get it*, and those who *don’t*.

In these moments, persuasion starts to feel optional. If someone doesn’t immediately align, they’re perceived not as thoughtful dissenters, but as blockers. We subtly stop trying to bring others along. Not because we’re lazy or unkind—but because some part of us has decided it isn’t worth the effort.

Sometimes this sounds like: *“People just need to do it.”*  
Sometimes it looks like: *silently opting out of the conversation.*  
Sometimes it manifests as: *"they're just not a missionary."*

This isn't a story about villains. It's a story about a feedback loop. When we perceive ourselves as Seers—those who see further, deeper, or clearer—it becomes tempting to conserve energy, avoid friction, and withhold until the “right” people emerge. In high-stakes, high-complexity settings, this can feel like a survival strategy. And often, it is.

But over time, this stance creates an epistemic divide. Trust collapses into loyalty. Curiosity shrinks. Dissent is mistaken for deficiency. We stop asking: *What might they be seeing that I’m not?* and instead ask, *Are they with us or not?*

This is the shadow side of strong vision. It’s not the conviction that’s the problem—it’s how the system sorts people in response to it. When alignment becomes a loyalty test, learning slows. When “not getting it” becomes a moral failing, we lose the capacity to expand the collective lens.

So the invitation isn’t to dilute vision—it’s to design systems that metabolize difference without defaulting to dismissal. That cultivate signal, even when it shows up with rough edges. That assume people *could* get it—if given context, curiosity, and care.

Because sometimes, the difference between “getting it” and “not getting it” isn’t capacity—it’s access.

---

**Title Riffs:**

- **The Seer Trap** (original vibe—mythic, cognitive, slightly game-y)
- **Dismissal as a Design Pattern** (clean and systems-forward)
- **When Vision Sorts Instead of Spreads** (a bit more abstract, evocative)
- **Getting It, or Getting Got** (playful, sharp)
- **The Binary Blur: Who Gets It and Who Doesn’t** (FLUX-y complexity lens)
- **The Quiet Cost of Conviction** (gentle but pointed)
- **With Us or Wasting Our Time** (more direct, slightly spicier)

Any of those speak to you? Want to go more poetic, provocative, or deadpan?

### User - 2025-03-24 17:08:17

Make both the title and the piece lean a little more toward the positive. Keep the problem front end center but add more thoughts about what you can do instead and capture the positive angle in the title

Love this direction—naming the pattern *and* creating space for alternatives is peak FLUX. Here's the revised piece with a more hopeful arc, more emphasis on what’s possible, and a reframed title that captures the shift from dismissal to design.

---

**🌀 From “Getting It” to Building It**  
*How to move from sorting people to scaling understanding*

You're in a meeting. A leader lays out a bold new direction—high conviction, high complexity. Someone asks a clarifying question. It's a reasonable question, but it’s met with a hand wave: *“You’ll get it once we’re further along.”* A few people nod. Others fall silent. Nothing explodes—but the undercurrent is clear: you either get it, or you don’t.

And if you don’t? You’re probably not worth the time.

It’s a subtle pattern, but a consequential one. When conviction meets complexity, it’s tempting to conserve energy by focusing only on those who instantly align. We’ve seen this across domains—from product ops to strategy to social change: a creeping tendency to treat understanding as a filter rather than a field to cultivate.

It can sound like: *“People just need to do it.”*  
It can feel like: *silence in the room where dissent used to live.*  
It can manifest as: *slotting people as missionaries or mercenaries based on how quickly they comply.*

We don’t do this because we’re unkind. We do it because we’re managing threat and friction. We’re trying to protect the fragile scaffolding of an early-stage vision. But if we’re not careful, the system starts to do the sorting for us. Trust calcifies into loyalty. Doubt gets read as disloyalty. And we stop building shared understanding—because we’ve already decided who’s capable of having it.

So what’s the alternative?

One shift is to treat alignment not as a binary, but as a developmental process. “Getting it” isn’t a static trait—it’s a function of exposure, context, timing, and trust. What looks like resistance may just be a different n-ply perspective, or a signal that hasn’t had the space to land yet.

Another shift is designing for shared sensemaking instead of unilateral clarity. That might look like narrating your thinking aloud, even when it’s messy. Asking what someone else is seeing instead of re-explaining your own point louder. Recognizing that bringing people along isn’t extra work—it *is* the work, especially when navigating ambiguity.

And perhaps the biggest shift: moving from the “Seer” mindset—where only a few can perceive the truth—to a *builder* mindset, where understanding is constructed collectively, over time. When we make that move, we open up a different kind of possibility: one where people can grow into alignment, not just be judged by whether they already possess it.

Because ultimately, conviction without connection limits scale. And clarity that can’t be shared isn’t strategy—it’s soliloquy.

Let me know if you’d like to sharpen the “what you can do instead” section even more, or thread in specific FLUX themes like *signal vs. status*, *n-ply thinking*, or *sensemaking as infrastructure*. Always down to add more layers.

Absolutely. Switching the perspective to *you* makes the pattern feel closer to home—and more introspective, which fits beautifully with the FLUX ethos of zooming out from the personal to the systemic. Here's the updated version:

---

**🌀 From “Getting It” to Building It**  
*How to move from sorting people to scaling understanding*

You're in a meeting. You lay out a bold new direction—high conviction, high complexity. It’s a strategy you’ve thought through deeply. You know where it’s going, and why it matters. Someone asks a clarifying question. It’s reasonable, but you wave it off: *“You’ll get it once we’re further along.”* A few people nod. Others go quiet. No conflict, no uproar—but a subtle divide opens up: those who “get it,” and those who don’t.

And if they don’t? Some part of you wonders if it’s even worth explaining again.

It’s a subtle pattern, but a consequential one. When conviction meets complexity, it’s tempting to conserve energy by focusing on those who instantly align. We’ve all been there. You’ve done the work to connect the dots, and the friction of going back to basics feels costly—maybe even threatening. But over time, this stance can harden. We stop building shared understanding—because we’ve already decided who’s capable of having it.

It can sound like: *“People just need to do it.”*  
It can feel like: *your own growing frustration when the team doesn’t click fast enough.*  
It can manifest as: *writing off someone’s questions as proof they’re not a “missionary.”*

We don’t do this because we’re dismissive. We do it because we’re navigating ambiguity, trying to preserve momentum, and sometimes just trying to stay afloat. But when we treat understanding as a fixed attribute instead of a shared construction, the system starts doing the sorting for us. Trust becomes a loyalty test. Doubt is mistaken for deficiency.

So what’s the alternative?

One shift is to treat alignment not as a prerequisite, but as a process. “Getting it” isn’t a static quality—it’s a product of access, timing, exposure, and experience. What looks like resistance may actually be signal that hasn't landed yet, or a different perspective worth folding in.

Another shift is designing for shared sensemaking. That might mean narrating your mental model instead of assuming it’s obvious. Making space for dissent even when time feels tight. Asking what someone else is seeing instead of doubling down on being understood.

And maybe the biggest shift: trading the “Seer” stance for a *builder* stance. Not the lone visionary scanning the horizon, but the architect of an environment where understanding scales. Where people grow into alignment—because the system invites them in.

Because ultimately, conviction without connection limits scale. And clarity that can’t be shared isn’t strategy—it’s soliloquy.

Yes—love that addition. It brings in a more embodied, experiential approach to sensemaking and really aligns with FLUX’s emphasis on *designing for realization, not just transmission*. Here’s the revised version with that thread woven into the final third:

And sometimes, instead of trying to *explain* your insight, the most powerful move is to design an experience that allows others to *feel* the tension for themselves. Insight often lands not through explanation but through recognition—when someone hits the same friction, feels the same constraints, or bumps into the same blind spot. That moment of resonance creates the condition for durable alignment—not just agreement, but shared meaning.

And maybe the biggest shift: trading the “Seer” stance for a *builder* stance. Not the lone visionary scanning the horizon, but the architect of an environment where understanding scales. Where people grow into alignment—because the system invites them in.

Absolutely—here’s a compact FLUX take on Beginner’s Mind that keeps it grounded, systems-aware, and a little mind-bendy:

---

**🌀 Beginner’s Mind Isn’t About Knowing Less—It’s About Sorting Less**

In FLUX, we often talk about *mental liquidity*—the ability to hold multiple frames without prematurely collapsing them. Beginner’s Mind is one of the cleanest entry points into this stance.

It doesn’t mean being naïve. It means resisting the reflex to slot new inputs into old categories. When we approach a system—or a person—as if we already understand it, we stop noticing what doesn’t fit. Complexity gets filtered out in favor of confirmation. Status replaces signal. We mistake recognition for understanding.

Beginner’s Mind is a design choice: to delay judgment, to decenter expertise, and to stay open to emergent structure. It’s a posture that invites insight not through mastery, but through presence. And in systems work, that’s often the difference between iterating the past and sensing what wants to emerge.

It’s not about knowing nothing. It’s about noticing everything.

Absolutely. Here's the updated version with a light-touch origin and a bit more grounding in what Beginner’s Mind actually means, while keeping that FLUX-y sharpness:

---

**🌀 Beginner’s Mind Isn’t About Knowing Less—It’s About Sorting Less**

We often discuss the importance of being able to hold multiple lenses at once. *Beginner’s Mind* is one of the cleanest entry points into this stance.

The term comes from Zen Buddhism—*Shoshin*, or “beginner’s mind,” refers to approaching a situation with openness, curiosity, and a lack of preconceptions, even when we’re already experienced. As Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki wrote: *“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.”*

It doesn’t mean being naïve. It means resisting the reflex to slot new inputs into old categories. When we approach a system—or a person—as if we already understand it, we stop noticing what doesn’t fit. Complexity gets filtered out in favor of confirmation. Status replaces signal. We mistake recognition for understanding.
