The Symmetry of Trust
In a previous issue we visited the integrative model of trust developed by Mayer et al. Let’s revisit this rich framework. 

In the integrative model of trust, risk taking is one of the pillars: trust cannot exist without some mutually perceived risk. This is a big idea: it appears that trust cannot exist without the potential for distrust. We build trust when we take risks and engage in a relationship despite that potential. Our degree of trust depends on the previous experience of taking risks combined with a few factors — ability, benevolence, and integrity — that we automatically tally up when we determine another party’s trustworthiness.Put differently, trust building depends on taking risks, on becoming vulnerable to the other party. 

What can this insight tell us about how risk symmetry impacts trust in a relationship? Imagine that there are two parties who are interacting. When the perceived risk is roughly equal, we are in a sweet spot for developing trust: both parties are interested in developing more trust. Developing this trust reduces their personal risk which allows them to expand the interaction and take bigger risks. Trust grows incrementally. 

When the risk is highly asymmetric, no trust can develop. For example, totalitarian regimes seek total loyalty, not trust. In such relationships, the space for distrust is so great, it is nearly impossible to contemplate trust, even as a concept. In some ways, the complete absence of trust is clarifying. In such a zero-sum environment, it’s everyone for themselves.

The most tumultuous area is the one where the symmetry is ambiguous: we are pretty sure it’s not completely asymmetrical, but we’re also not confident the risk taken by both parties is equal enough. This leads to mistrust: the ambiguity gives rise to unease, with gut feelings and spidey senses guiding our trust-based thinking more often than not. Trust can exist, but it is tenuous and fragile, with sometimes extraordinary amounts of effort required to just retain it.

If an organization has the good fortune to grow, they will see themselves transform from small, tight-knit teams that make magic happen to becoming true industry giants beset by hierarchy and process. This journey traverses the space of trust symmetry.

The small team with a shared fate is in the sweet spot of trust. Everyone has similar stakes in the team’s success, and everyone’s role is of similar importance. Trust is paramount here, and the lack thereof will be a sure cause for failure.

Medium-sized teams will go through a period of trouble. The power of the organization grows significantly larger than the power of each individual. Yet the company still needs closeness and high trust to preserve the original effectiveness that brought success in the first place.

Beyond a certain size, organizations will need to exert so much energy to preserve trust that they will inevitably look for ways to reduce the need for it. To continue to function, they will need to find ways to mechanize the relationships and rely more and more on the fact that the risk symmetry is weighted strongly toward the organization. This mechanization isn’t always bad. It can be highly efficient and it can be more fair since it’s less dependent on being in the inner circle of trust. 

However, in making this shift, organizations give up the magic that conjured them. Over time, they may misplace their purpose and, eventually, lose cohesion entirely. Unlike governmental bureaucracies, businesses must continue to add up to more than just the sum of their parts. And that is incredibly challenging when the environment pushes everyone toward the zero-sum game.

Escaping this destiny is hard, but the history of companies that have remade themselves shows that while it is impossible to recapture the highly symmetric trust of the early days, it is possible to replace it with something that is less inspiring but highly effective in its own right.

Now here's a new one. Draft a 5-7 paragraph statement that illustrates the way that this person lives the value of "win together". Use direct quotes from the raw data where appropriate.

VALUE DEFINITION:
**Win together:**

Each of us is an owner here in two ways: of our work and of the company (as team members and shareholders). We all win only if the entire company wins, which calls for the right balance of collaboration and ownership. Too little collaboration causes chaos and brings disappointing results. Too much collaboration crushes ownership and dulls outcomes. As owners of the company, we speak up when something is wrong (even when it’s hard) and help create an environment where we respectfully consider every voice.

RAW NOMINATION DATA:
Values selected - Win together
Joe has been a one-person army in making the Sourcegraph Accounts vision a reality. And because of his efforts, we now have a new core component to use for our internal services. It's already the backbone for user management for Cody PLG, authorizing internal requests to Cody Gateway, and will continue to be used for more things in the coming months.
But the biggest sign of Joe's impact has been that you probably have no idea what I'm talking about. You probably don't know that all user accounts on sourcegraph.com were migrated to a new system. Or that a new way to securely authenticate internal services has been rolled out, and been continually improved since launch. Being able to land a project like this without breaking things or requiring some sort of "all hands on deck" firedrill is definitely a sign of a job well done.
Working with Joe this past quarter has helped the Cody PLG team "Win Together".
The Cody Pro service was the first consumer of Sourcegraph Accounts (even using the same cloud infrastructure for a time). This required careful coordination, a few surprising-but-definitely-critical features to be add, and plenty hand holding to get things configured right.
Joe has been a great and instrumental partner in helping the PLG team get our serviced launched. And since then, as Joe continues to improve the service -- shipping an SDK repo, launching a "Sessions API", etc. --  he's continued to worth closely to ensure that he's building the right thing. (Both to serve the PLG team's needs today, but also receiving lots of feedback about how to build the right platform for other services in the future.)
Some specific examples of this type of collaboration are:
- Proposing a standard way to describe SAMS tokens, and after some thoughtful discussions with others, ended up with a very different approach. (Which I believe everyone would agree is better in the long run.)
- Owning the process of splitting the SAMS and Cody SSC backend services from the same binary. (Again without any downtime, and requiring a great deal of care and attention to detail.) He did more work than was expected, because the PLG team didn't have the time to prioritize it this quarter. And still managed to leave the service in a better state. (e.g. launching a "sessions API", or providing better isolation between dependencies, refactoring shared, internal packages, etc.)
I would like to underscore that while the project may not have the visible impact of a new feature or capability, delivering it in such a way that it "just worked" is a big accomplishment.
Ad also, Joe's continued to refine the Sourcegraph Accounts service over the past few months, putting great attention into an "SDK" for integrations to use. This again doesn't seem impressive at a glance. But if he didn't do such a great job, I assure you there would be plenty of howling, acrimony, and urgency to fix these issues ASAP.

Joe's exemplary efforts in spearheading the Sourcegraph Accounts initiative perfectly illustrate the core value of "win together." Throughout this project, Joe has not only demonstrated technical expertise but has fostered a culture of collaboration and shared success, crucial to our collective achievements.

As the driving force behind the new core component that now underpins our internal services, Joe's role has been pivotal. He managed the seamless migration of all user accounts on sourcegraph.com to a new system and introduced a secure method for authenticating internal services. His ability to execute these significant changes quietly and effectively—without disruption or the need for emergency interventions—is a testament to his skill and meticulous planning. This stealthy yet impactful delivery means many might not even be aware of the magnitude of his contributions. As one colleague put it, "Being able to land a project like this without breaking things or requiring some sort of 'all hands on deck' firedrill is definitely a sign of a job well done."

Joe's commitment to the "win together" ethos extends beyond his technical contributions. His collaborative spirit was crucial as the Cody Pro service became the first to utilize Sourcegraph Accounts. This integration required "careful coordination" and the introduction of "surprising-but-definitely-critical features," ensuring everything was configured correctly. His proactive approach in these collaborations demonstrates how he embodies our value of balancing individual ownership with teamwork.

Moreover, Joe's ongoing enhancements to the service, such as shipping an SDK repo and launching a "Sessions API," further showcase his dedication to continuous improvement and partnership. He remains closely connected with the PLG team to ensure that his developments meet current needs while also gathering feedback for future enhancements. This iterative, feedback-driven process highlights how Joe strategically positions our projects for broader applicability and future readiness.

Joe's influence also shines through in his methodical approach to standardizing and improving backend processes. For instance, his proposal for a standard way to describe SAMS tokens led to a significant pivot after thoughtful discussions with teammates, culminating in a solution that was widely regarded as superior. His ability to lead such initiatives, listen to feedback, and implement changes without causing downtime illustrates a high level of technical and interpersonal adeptness.

In closing, Joe exemplifies the "win together" value through his unwavering commitment to our collective success. His work may often operate behind the scenes, but its impact on our company’s operational capabilities is profound. By driving projects that enhance our infrastructure while ensuring seamless integration and continuous improvement, Joe not only champions our immediate goals but also secures a foundation for future innovations. Thank you, Joe, for your exceptional dedication to our team and the broader success of our company.
