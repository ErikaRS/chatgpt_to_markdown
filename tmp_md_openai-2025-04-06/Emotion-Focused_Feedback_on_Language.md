I am writing a response to a question using a concrete example around which emotions ran high. Please give feedback on where the language I use might cause an emotional reaction.

QUESTION: I believe we do want new ideas and support mistakes, but I totally understand that isnâ€™t coming through in many cases. What advice do you all have here?

DRAFT RESPONSE
One important thing is to make sure that language around mistakes doesn't come across as blaming or attributing bad judgment. 

I'll use a concrete example: Sentinel. Important caveats:
- I wasn't here for this, so I only have the different histories I've been told and the things that I've seen said about that history
- The actually specifics of who was right and who was wrong in this case don't matter relative to the feedback about communication style, so let's leave them aside and agree that this conversation is about the narrative around Sentinel, not a historical record.

The narrative around Sentinel from the perspective that I've heard from multiple SWEs (not just Eric and Cesar) was:
- An idea came up at Merge in Barcelona
- Eric and Cesar showed high agency by starting to work on it
- They never got formal approval.
- However, they communicated about that in the open, including on threads where various leaders (e.g., Steve and Quinn) replied in positive ways.
- The decision was made not to ship

Up until this point, we're fine. What comes after is where there "can't make mistakes" narrative started happening.
- Both in calibration and in company meetings, @sqs, you used language like "secret project" and "going rogue" when talking about Sentinel.
- In calibration, I remember that you brought up Sentinel as a negative example of bad judgment for both Eric and Cesar. That wasn't public but the underlying belief came through in some of the public statements.

The impression folks have taken away from that is if someone makes a high agency decision and they're wrong, it has consequences both public and private. Very much, "if you come at the king, you'd better not miss" vibes around risk taking.

So! What's the takeaway constructive feedback here?
- When people do work that is not aligned with the direction we're going, we should use more neutral language (experiment, deprioritized) or, even better, positive language (here's what we learned from this...). We should avoid negative language like "secretive" or "going rogue".
- In calibration, we should set a standard that if leadership knew the work people were doing and didn't give them feedback to change, then the fact that we thought they should have changed is not grounds for giving the individual a partially meets or lower.

Your draft response provides a clear and structured analysis of the situation, which is commendable. However, there are a few areas where the language and framing could potentially stir emotions or be perceived as confrontational. Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. **Framing the Incident (Sentinel)**: The way the Sentinel example is introduced and discussed could be perceived as indirectly assigning blame or implying negligence. Even though you state that you're not focusing on who was right or wrong, the narrative might still be interpreted as pointing fingers, especially when mentioning specific names and actions.

    - **Suggestion**: Consider reframing this part to focus more on the general dynamics and less on specific individuals. For instance, "In a past project, there were instances where..."

2. **Use of Direct Quotes and Specific Language**: The use of direct quotes like "secret project" and "going rogue" and attributing them to a specific individual (@sqs) could come across as accusatory or confrontational.

    - **Suggestion**: Instead of quoting directly, you might summarize the perception of the language used. For example, "There have been instances where the language used to describe independent projects might have unintentionally conveyed a sense of wrongdoing..."

3. **Implication of Consequences**: The section discussing the implications for Eric and Cesar, especially in terms of judgment and public/private consequences, could be seen as speculative and indirectly critical of the leadership's decision-making.

    - **Suggestion**: Soften this part by focusing on the perception rather than the implied intention. For example, "The perception that emerged was that taking risks could lead to negative outcomes, which might discourage future innovative efforts."

4. **Constructive Feedback Section**: This section is well-intended but might be interpreted as prescriptive or as an indirect critique of past leadership decisions.

    - **Suggestion**: Frame these as suggestions or potential areas for improvement rather than direct advice. For example, "One approach could be to use more neutral or positive language when discussing projects that didn't align with our immediate goals, such as referring to them as experiments or learning opportunities."

5. **Tone and Approach**: Throughout the response, ensure the tone remains constructive and focused on improvement rather than dwelling on past mistakes.

Overall, the response is thoughtful and aims to address the issue at hand. The key is to maintain a balanced tone that acknowledges past experiences without seeming accusatory, and to focus on future improvements rather than past mistakes.

Please give feedback again with the assumption that it is important to keep the feedback concrete and specific

### Assistant - 2023-12-01 09:24:58

Under the assumption that concrete and specific feedback is essential, your draft response does well in addressing particular issues with clear examples. However, even with the need for specificity, it's crucial to balance directness with diplomacy to avoid unintentionally provoking strong emotions. Here are some areas for refinement:

1. **Specificity of the Sentinel Example**: While it's good to use a concrete example, the detailed recounting of the Sentinel project, including names and specific actions, might come across as overly critical or as if you are rehashing past conflicts. This could inadvertently reignite old tensions.

    - **Suggestion**: Keep the example but slightly abstract the details. For example, instead of naming individuals, refer to "team members" or "participants in the project." This keeps the focus on the situation rather than the individuals.

2. **Direct Quotes and Language**: Using direct quotes like "secret project" and "going rogue" can be impactful but may also seem confrontational, especially when attributed to a specific person.

    - **Suggestion**: If specific language used in the past is crucial to your point, frame it within a context that acknowledges the potential for misinterpretation. For instance, "Terms such as 'secret project' were used, which might have been perceived as..."

3. **Discussion of Consequences for Individuals**: Mentioning specific consequences for individuals (like Eric and Cesar) can be seen as delving into personal matters, which might not be appropriate in a general feedback discussion.

    - **Suggestion**: Generalize this part. For example, "In situations where team members took initiative but were later criticized, it gave an impression that risk-taking could lead to negative consequences."

4. **Constructive Feedback Section**: This section is direct and specific, which is good. However, ensure it does not come across as too prescriptive or critical of past decisions.

    - **Suggestion**: Phrase suggestions as questions or options for consideration. For instance, "Could we consider using more neutral or positive language in similar situations in the future?"

5. **Overall Tone**: While being specific, ensure the tone remains constructive, focused on learning and improvement, rather than pointing out faults.

In summary, your response is effective in its specificity but could benefit from a more cautious approach in discussing sensitive past events and in framing suggestions for the future. The goal is to provide specific feedback without inadvertently causing defensiveness or resentment.

Let's try one more time. You are assessing this from a perspective that really values the radical candor balance of caring personally _and_ challenging directly. 

### Assistant - 2023-12-01 09:43:28

Given the emphasis on radical candor, which involves balancing personal care with direct challenges, your draft response aligns well with this approach. However, there are still aspects that could be fine-tuned to maintain this balance more effectively:

1. **Directness in the Sentinel Example**: Your use of a specific example with clear details is a good practice in radical candor, as it avoids vagueness and directly addresses the issue. However, the directness could be perceived as too focused on past actions of specific individuals, which might detract from the overall message of learning and moving forward.

    - **Suggestion**: Maintain the directness but shift the emphasis slightly towards what can be learned from this example, rather than what went wrong. This can help in focusing on future improvement while still being candid about past mistakes.

2. **Language Used in Past Communications**: Your direct quoting of phrases like "secret project" and "going rogue" is a strong example of challenging directly. It's important, though, to balance this by acknowledging the intentions behind these words at the time they were used, which aligns with the 'caring personally' aspect.

    - **Suggestion**: After quoting, you might add something like, "While these terms were likely used to convey concern, they may have
