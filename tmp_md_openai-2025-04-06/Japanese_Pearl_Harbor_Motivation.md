I've read that the motivation for the Japanese attacking Pearl harbor was fear that the US was going to try to conquer parts of East Asia. Is this true? And if so, was it a legitimate fear? Did the US have credible aims towards invading or taking over any part of East Asia at that time?

The motivation for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, was complex and multifaceted, but it primarily centered around Japan's strategic interests and their perception of American interference in their expansionist goals.

### Japanese Motivation
1. **Resource Acquisition**: Japan was heavily dependent on imports for essential resources like oil, rubber, and metals. To secure these resources, Japan sought to expand its influence in Southeast Asia, particularly in areas controlled by European colonial powers.
   
2. **Strategic Calculations**: The Japanese military leadership believed that a swift and decisive strike against the United States Pacific Fleet would cripple American naval capabilities, giving Japan the time to consolidate its gains in Southeast Asia and build a defensible perimeter.

3. **US Sanctions and Embargoes**: The United States had imposed economic sanctions and embargoes on Japan, particularly an oil embargo, in response to Japanese aggression in China and Indochina. These measures threatened Japan's resource security and economic stability, leading to heightened tensions.

### Fear of US Interference
While the fear that the US intended to conquer parts of East Asia might have been an element of Japanese propaganda, it was not the primary motivation behind the attack. Instead, the Japanese leadership viewed the United States as a significant obstacle to their imperial ambitions in the Asia-Pacific region.

### US Policy and Intentions
1. **Non-Interventionist Stance**: Prior to Pearl Harbor, the United States had adopted a largely non-interventionist stance towards global conflicts, focusing on providing aid to allies through measures like the Lend-Lease Act while avoiding direct military involvement.

2. **Philippines**: The United States had colonial interests in the Philippines, a crucial strategic location in the Pacific. The defense of the Philippines was a concern, but the US did not have immediate plans to expand its territorial holdings in East Asia.

3. **Opposition to Japanese Expansion**: The primary US concern was the destabilization of the region due to Japanese expansionism. The US aimed to maintain the balance of power and protect its interests and those of its allies in the Pacific.

### Conclusion
While Japan did fear American interference with its expansionist goals, the notion that the US had credible aims towards invading or conquering parts of East Asia at that time is not supported by historical evidence. The US was more focused on containing Japanese aggression rather than pursuing territorial expansion in East Asia. The attack on Pearl Harbor was driven more by Japan's desire to neutralize American power in the Pacific and secure the resources necessary for its war efforts.

That makes a lot more sense. I'm glad that I asked.
