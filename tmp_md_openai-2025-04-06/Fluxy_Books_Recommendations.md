The FLUX Review highlights books that embody "fluxiness"—works that challenge linear thinking, embrace uncertainty, or explore complex systems. Here are some non-sci-fi and non-fantasy examples that fit the fluxy ethos:

1. **"Seeing Like a State" by James C. Scott** – Explores how high-modernist planning often fails due to its inability to account for the messy, local realities of human life.
2. **"The Mushroom at the End of the World" by Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing** – Investigates how the Matsutake mushroom trade reveals new ways of thinking about capitalism, ecology, and survival in precarious times.
3. **"The Dawn of Everything" by David Graeber and David Wengrow** – Reframes human history by challenging conventional narratives of social progress and civilization.
4. **"Braiding Sweetgrass" by Robin Wall Kimmerer** – Weaves Indigenous knowledge with Western science to offer a relational view of ecology and sustainability.
5. **"A Thousand Brains" by Jeff Hawkins** – Introduces a new theory of intelligence that moves away from traditional AI and neuroscience models.
6. **"The Utopia of Rules" by David Graeber** – Examines how bureaucracy shapes modern life in unexpected and often absurd ways.
7. **"Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows** – A foundational text on systems thinking and how complex interactions shape the world.

These books embody fluxiness by embracing ambiguity, interconnectedness, and nonlinear perspectives. Would you like recommendations based on a particular theme?

Got it! Here are some fluxy **fiction** books that aren’t sci-fi or fantasy but still embrace uncertainty, complexity, and nonlinear thinking:  

1. **"If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler" by Italo Calvino** – A novel that plays with narrative structure, making the reader an active participant in an unfinished story.  
2. **"2666" by Roberto Bolaño** – A sprawling, fragmented novel that resists easy interpretation and interweaves multiple storylines.  
3. **"The Hearing Trumpet" by Leonora Carrington** – A surreal, darkly humorous novel about an elderly woman uncovering secrets in a retirement home.  
4. **"Lost Children Archive" by Valeria Luiselli** – A layered novel blending fiction and documentary elements to explore migration and memory.  
5. **"Hopscotch" by Julio Cortázar** – A novel that can be read in multiple sequences, challenging traditional storytelling.  
6. **"The Mezzanine" by Nicholson Baker** – A hyper-detailed exploration of ordinary moments, elevating the mundane into something profound.  
7. **"Pond" by Claire-Louise Bennett** – A collection of seemingly disconnected vignettes that form a fluid, introspective narrative.  
8. **"Outline" by Rachel Cusk** – A novel structured around conversations, revealing a protagonist through absence rather than presence.  

These novels embody fluxiness by defying traditional structures, embracing ambiguity, or foregrounding systems of meaning-making rather than simple plots. Want more recommendations based on a specific theme or mood?
