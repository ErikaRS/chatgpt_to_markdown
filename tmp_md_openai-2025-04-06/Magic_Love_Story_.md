As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the quaint town of Ingleside, Marigold Lesley, now a grown woman with an air of magic still lingering around her, found herself wandering the familiar streets, lost in thought. Her heart, once content with the whispers of fairies and the secrets of the enchanted forest, had begun to yearn for something – or rather, someone – more tangible. Little did she know that her path would soon cross with the captivating and equally spirited child of Rilla Blythe and Ken Ford, whose fiery spirit and love for adventure would ignite a passion in Marigold that would transcend the boundaries of their intertwined, storied legacies.
