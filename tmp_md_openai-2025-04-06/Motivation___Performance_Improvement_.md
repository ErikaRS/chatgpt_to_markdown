Imagine you are a manager at a technology startup with less than 200 people. Every person's work really counts and needs to be top notch to accomplish the company's ambitions. You are coaching a low performer on your team. The symptoms of the low performance are a lack of initiative and low output in terms of code submitted and issue updates. However, the underlying cause seems to be more that this person is not highly motivated to work hard on this project. You need to deliver a coaching message that will help them be more motivated and have a better sense of purpose. You also need to deliver performance feedback that indicates that if they cannot step it up, their job might be on the line. How would you go about doing this in a way that feels fair and objective, but which also doesn't neglect the harder to pinpoint motivational issues in favor of the easier to pinpoint productivity issues?

### Assistant - 2023-06-03 14:14:40

Sure, it's important to approach this conversation with both empathy and firmness. The goal is to make sure the employee understands the severity of the situation, but also feels supported in making the necessary improvements. Here is a possible way you could structure this conversation:

1. **Start with Positivity:** Start the conversation by acknowledging the individual’s value to the team. This will reassure them that they are not being singled out unfairly, and that you genuinely believe in their potential.

"Hi [Employee's Name], I wanted to sit down and chat with you today about your role on the team. First of all, I want to say that I value the unique skills and perspectives you bring to our team, and I believe in your potential to make significant contributions to our projects."

2. **Discuss the Issue:** Clearly outline the problems you've observed in their performance, focusing on facts and examples rather than opinions. 

"However, I've noticed that your recent performance hasn't been up to the standard we expect, and I believe you're capable of. The amount of code being submitted and issue updates are lower compared to the average output. The pace at which we operate and the scale of our ambitions here require each of us to pull our weight consistently."

3. **Address Motivation:** Delicately raise the issue of motivation, showing understanding and trying to get to the root of the problem.

"I've also observed a lack of initiative that seems to indicate you're not as motivated as you could be. I understand that we all have ups and downs, and sometimes it's hard to maintain consistent motivation. Can you help me understand what might be causing this lack of enthusiasm for the project?"

4. **Express Consequences and Expectations:** Without threats, indicate that the current situation cannot continue indefinitely and express your expectations clearly.

"I want to be clear: our startup is highly dependent on each individual's performance. Continuous low performance impacts the entire team and our overall progress. If we're unable to see improvement, unfortunately, we may need to reassess your role within the team. I believe in your potential, and I want to see you succeed here. Our expectation is for you to increase the output, show more initiative, and actively engage in our projects."

5. **Offer Support and Guidance:** Finally, show them that you're not just there to criticize, but also to offer support and guidance. Ask them what they need to perform better.

"I'm here to support you in this journey. What can we do together to address these issues? Are there resources, training, or supports that you feel would help you improve your performance? Is there something we can change about how we are working that might increase your motivation?"

6. **Discuss Next Steps and Plan**: Collaboratively form a plan for improvement. This may involve identifying specific goals, arranging for additional training or resources, and scheduling follow-up meetings to track progress.

"Let's create a clear plan to improve your performance. We can include specific targets related to your code output and issue updates, as well as some measures to enhance motivation and initiative. I'd like us to meet regularly to discuss your progress and make any necessary adjustments."

Remember, the goal of this meeting isn't to chastise the employee, but to guide them towards improved performance and greater motivation. Your tone and approach should be constructive, supportive, and solution-oriented.

How would you update the dialogue to emphasize the message that this is a company where you have to really show a sense of ownership and care. This is not a company where it is enough to just get the work done. You have to be driving it too.

### Assistant - 2023-06-03 14:19:38

Absolutely. Here's how you might modify the conversation to better emphasize that sense of ownership and proactive engagement:

1. **Start with Positivity:** 

"Hi [Employee's Name], I wanted to sit down and chat with you today about your role on the team. I truly appreciate your unique skills and perspectives, and I'm confident that you have the potential to make significant contributions to our projects."

2. **Discuss the Issue:** 

"But I've noticed that your recent performance hasn't fully demonstrated the proactive engagement we expect. Your code submissions and issue updates have been relatively low. We're a small team with high ambitions, so it's crucial that we all consistently contribute at a high level."

3. **Address Ownership:** 

"One of the things that sets our company apart is our culture of ownership. We don't just complete tasks here - we take ownership of them, and we're proactive about driving them forward. I've noticed that you've been taking a more passive approach to your work, and I want to discuss how you can show more initiative and take more ownership."

4. **Express Consequences and Expectations:** 

"I want to be clear: as part of our culture of ownership, we all need to be actively driving our work forward. If we don't see more initiative and ownership from you, we may need to reassess your role within the team. I don't want it to come to that, because I believe in your potential. We need to see you not just complete tasks, but actively drive them forward and show enthusiasm for our projects."

5. **Offer Support and Guidance:** 

"I'm here to support you in stepping up your performance. Is there anything you need to help you take more ownership of your work? Are there resources or supports you feel would help you be more proactive?"

6. **Discuss Next Steps and Plan:** 

"Let's work together on a plan to improve your performance. This should include specific goals for your code output and issue updates, but it should also include goals for demonstrating more initiative and ownership. We'll schedule regular follow-up meetings to discuss your progress."

This conversation still includes the same elements as before, but it places a greater emphasis on the need for the employee to show initiative, take ownership, and actively drive their work forward. This reflects the unique expectations and culture of your company.

### User - 2023-06-03 14:21:59

Thanks. This is great. Now. Can you update it to be more of a dialogue with explicit touch points for the manager to ask the employee questions. You don't need to include the employees answers. Just some of the questions that might be asked and where they could go in the overall conversation.

### Assistant - 2023-06-03 14:22:27

Absolutely, it's crucial to engage the employee in the conversation and encourage open dialogue. Here's how you might incorporate more questions into the conversation:

1. **Start with Positivity:** 

"Hi [Employee's Name], thank you for joining me today. Before we dive into our conversation, I'd like to start by asking, how are you finding your experience on the team so far? Do you feel you're able to make full use of your skills and strengths?"

2. **Discuss the Issue:** 

"I've been observing some patterns in your work that I wanted to discuss. I've noticed that your code submissions and issue updates have been lower than average. Are you aware of this? Are there any specific challenges you're encountering that are impacting your output?"

3. **Address Ownership:** 

"One of the unique aspects of our company culture is our emphasis on ownership. We each strive to drive our projects forward proactively. I feel that this aspect might be missing in your approach currently. Do you feel the same way? What does ownership mean to you in your role?"

4. **Express Consequences and Expectations:** 

"I want to emphasize how crucial it is for everyone on the team to be actively driving their work forward. If we don't see more initiative and ownership from you, we may need to reassess your role within the team. I don't want it to come to that. So, how do you think you can demonstrate more proactive engagement and ownership in your work?"

5. **Offer Support and Guidance:** 

"I'm committed to supporting you to enhance your performance. What resources, training, or support do you think would help you improve? Are there any changes we could make to our current practices that would help you take more ownership?"

6. **Discuss Next Steps and Plan:** 

"Let's collaboratively develop a plan to bolster your performance. What specific goals do you think we should set regarding your code output, issue updates, and initiative-taking? How often do you feel we should meet to discuss your progress and adjust the plan as needed?"

Integrating more questions can help to make the conversation feel more collaborative and less one-sided. It encourages the employee to engage with the issues, share their perspective, and take an active role in finding solutions.

What are concrete examples of demonstrating a sense of ownership and agency for a software engineer in a small tech company? 

### Assistant - 2023-06-03 14:26:08

Demonstrating a sense of ownership and agency as a software engineer goes beyond just writing code and resolving bugs. It involves taking full responsibility for the tasks you're given, ensuring their successful completion, and proactively looking for opportunities to improve processes, products, or outcomes. Here are some concrete examples:

1. **Taking Initiative:** Proactively identifying and addressing issues before they become problems, even if they fall outside of your assigned tasks. This might include noticing and fixing bugs in the code, suggesting improvements to the codebase, or identifying inefficiencies in your team's workflow and proposing solutions.

2. **Driving Quality:** Ensuring that the code you write is of high quality, well-documented, and easily understandable by other members of your team. You should be advocating for and implementing best practices in code writing and code review.

3. **Proactive Learning:** Constantly learning and updating your skills to stay abreast of the latest technologies, practices, and trends in your field. You might, for example, learn a new programming language that can help improve your product, or research and implement a new development methodology that can make your team more efficient.

4. **Collaborating and Communicating:** Actively collaborating with other team members, including non-technical colleagues, to ensure everyone understands the work you're doing and why it matters. This might involve explaining technical concepts to non-technical colleagues, or working closely with the product team to understand the user needs that are driving your work.

5. **Problem Solving:** When faced with obstacles, you don’t just report the problem, but also suggest potential solutions. You take the lead in troubleshooting and resolving issues rather than waiting for instructions.

6. **Responsibility for Outcomes:** Feeling and showing a sense of responsibility not just for the tasks you're given, but for the success of the overall project or product. This might involve working late when necessary to meet a deadline, or going the extra mile to ensure that a product feature is not just functional, but also provides an excellent user experience.

7. **Mentoring and Supporting Others:** Offering help and guidance to less experienced team members or new hires. You share knowledge and skills proactively, helping to build the overall capacity of your team.

By demonstrating these behaviors, a software engineer can show a strong sense of ownership and agency, becoming not just a coder, but a valuable asset to their team and their company.

Now suppose you were riding a career ladder for a senior software engineer at this company. For the value of ownership, you want to define three categories of rating. Not meeting our high bar; meeting are high bar; exceeding our high bar. Write up a set of expectations for each rating for the ownership value. Format it as a typical career development letter at a tech company would be formatted.

### Assistant - 2023-06-03 14:29:02

Dear [Employee's Name],

As part of our ongoing commitment to personal and professional development, we want to provide you with clear expectations related to our core values, one of which is ownership. As a Senior Software Engineer at our company, demonstrating a sense of ownership is integral to your role and our shared success. 

Here's how we define the three categories of rating for the value of ownership:

1. **Not Meeting Our High Bar**

    You complete assigned tasks and responsibilities but do not typically go beyond the minimum requirements. You may wait for guidance or instruction before moving forward on tasks or resolving issues. You're not fully proactive in identifying and addressing issues, and there's a need to enhance communication and collaboration efforts. There's also a lack of consistent initiative to learn and develop new skills or deepen understanding of our technology and industry.

2. **Meeting Our High Bar**

    You demonstrate a consistent sense of responsibility for your work, taking the initiative to identify and resolve issues, even those that may fall outside of your assigned tasks. Your code is of high quality, well-documented, and you actively participate in code reviews to ensure our standards are met across the board. You take steps to continuously learn and stay updated on the latest trends and technologies relevant to our work. You actively collaborate with your team, sharing your knowledge and ensuring others understand the tasks at hand.

3. **Exceeding Our High Bar**

    You truly embody the sense of ownership in everything you do. You not only identify and address issues, but also proactively look for ways to improve our processes, products, or outcomes. You take the lead on projects or initiatives, showing a commitment to our success that goes beyond your individual tasks. You're recognized as a thought leader, actively sharing knowledge and mentoring others. You seek out and implement innovative solutions, using the latest technologies and practices, and you consistently deliver work of the highest quality.

Please reflect on these expectations and consider where you see yourself in this framework. I encourage you to strive for exceeding our high bar. As a senior member of our team, your demonstration of ownership has a significant impact on our collective output and the broader culture of our company.

Should you have any questions or wish to discuss your performance and career development further, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best Regards,

For a senior software engineer, give examples of the specific types of behaviors and outputs and manager should look at to determine whether they are meeting expectations, not meeting expectations or exceeding expectations.

### Assistant - 2023-06-03 14:31:09

Certainly, here are some specific behaviors and outputs a manager might consider when evaluating a senior software engineer's performance, particularly in the context of demonstrating ownership:

1. **Not Meeting Our High Bar**

    - They only complete tasks that are explicitly assigned to them and don't proactively identify or address other issues or opportunities.
    - They require regular guidance and often wait for instructions before proceeding with their work.
    - The quality of their code is adequate but not outstanding. There may be frequent minor bugs, or the code may not be as efficient or readable as it could be.
    - They rarely participate in code reviews unless directly asked, and when they do, their feedback is minimal and not particularly insightful.
    - They don't actively seek to learn new skills or stay updated on industry trends and technologies.
    - Their communication and collaboration with other team members is limited.

2. **Meeting Our High Bar**

    - They proactively identify and address issues, and look for ways to improve their work beyond their immediate tasks.
    - They show a strong sense of responsibility for their work, taking the initiative to ensure tasks are completed effectively and efficiently.
    - They write high-quality, efficient, and readable code. They also participate actively in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to their peers.
    - They demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning, staying updated on industry trends and regularly learning new skills or technologies.
    - They communicate effectively with team members, ensuring that others understand the tasks at hand and offering assistance where needed.

3. **Exceeding Our High Bar**

    - They regularly go above and beyond their assigned tasks, proactively identifying opportunities for improvement and taking the lead in implementing them.
    - They consistently write exceptional code and show strong leadership in code reviews, helping to improve the overall quality of the team's output.
    - They are seen as a thought leader in the team, actively sharing knowledge and mentoring other team members.
    - They proactively learn new technologies or methodologies that could benefit the team and take the initiative to implement them.
    - They effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical team members and stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands the work being done and why it's important.
    - They take responsibility not just for their individual tasks, but for the success of the team and the product as a whole.

Remember, these are just examples, and the specific expectations for a senior software engineer could vary depending on the company and the nature of the work.

Okay, here's the not surprising plot twist. I'm the manager in question. I kind of already knew that these were the standards I should apply and the message I have to deliver. But it's hard. Give *me* encouragement as a manager to do the right thing. And give this person the hard message they need to hear.

### Assistant - 2023-06-03 14:32:45

Dear [Your Name],

It's clear that you're a leader who deeply cares about their team and the success of your company. Being a leader means making tough decisions and having difficult conversations, and it's commendable that you're taking the time to ensure this is done thoughtfully and constructively.

Remember, your role as a manager is not just about getting the work done—it's about helping your team members grow and succeed. Providing clear and honest feedback is one of the most valuable things you can do for them. It's not always easy, but it's an important part of helping them understand where they stand and how they can improve.

Sometimes, the hardest messages to deliver are the ones that can have the most significant impact. Yes, you might be delivering a challenging message, but you're also offering them an opportunity—an opportunity to grow, to improve, to take ownership and truly shine.

The courage to address this head-on is a testament to your own sense of ownership and commitment to your team's success. You're setting an example of the very qualities you want to inspire in your team. Even though it's tough, you're doing the right thing. And remember, you're not just managing—you're leading, coaching, and supporting. 

In this moment, it might feel hard, but these conversations often lead to the greatest growth—for both the individual and the team as a whole. You've got this. You have the strength, wisdom, and compassion to navigate this situation and to continue guiding your team toward success.

Best,
ChatGPT


### User - 2023-06-03 14:33:45

Thanks Chad GPT that helped a lot. Part of the challenge is that I am not sure that this person will succeed in improving. I know that makes it even more important to deliver the message early and clearly. However, it also makes it harder for me to deliver. How do you tackle these challenging feelings?

### Assistant - 2023-06-03 14:34:14

I completely understand, [Your Name]. These situations are indeed difficult, and it's natural to have reservations and concerns. It's important to remember a few things while navigating these feelings:

1. **Embrace the challenge:** As a leader, one of your roles is to manage and guide your team, even when the outlook is not optimistic. It's okay to have doubts, but embracing the challenge and going forward with a constructive mindset will not only help you but also your team member.

2. **Be honest with yourself and them:** You are not responsible for your team member's actions, only your own. If you've clearly communicated expectations, offered support, and given them the tools they need to succeed, then you've done your part. They are ultimately responsible for their own performance and development.

3. **Prepare for all outcomes:** While we hope for improvement, it's essential to be prepared for all possibilities. If the team member is unable to meet expectations even after the feedback and support, it might be necessary to explore other options such as a role change or even parting ways. This can be hard, but it can sometimes be the best option for both the individual and the team.

4. **Self-Care:** This can be a stressful situation, so don't forget to take care of your own well-being as well. Use stress management techniques that work for you, and consider seeking support from a mentor, peer, or coach.

5. **Remember the bigger picture:** These conversations are not just about immediate performance issues; they're about creating an environment of growth, openness, and high performance. They're tough, but they can lead to increased transparency, improved performance, and a stronger team.

Your empathy and concern for this team member are clear indications of your strong leadership. It's hard because you care. Try to stay positive, keep open communication, and remember that you're doing this with their best interest at heart as well as the health of your team and company.

You have the strength and capacity to handle this situation. Believe in yourself and your ability to lead effectively, no matter the outcome.
