I am someone who is nice and takes into consideration the wants and needs of others because it is the most effective way to lead and meet my goals. My boss, the CEO, and his co-founder, the CTO, equate my behavior with weakness. I don't want to convince them I'm right (I mean, that would be great, but let's be realistic). However, I want them to stay out of my way when they see me using methods they disagree with. If I'm not getting results, hold me accountable. But until then, I want to be left in peace. (And for what it's worth, I regularly get both direct and indirect feedback that people appreciate my style and that the org is more effective under me than it has been under any other vp of eng).

Your approach to leadership, which is based on empathy and understanding, aligns with what FLUX Review calls *“relational leadership,”* where attention to the human element is not only a personal value but a key to achieving effective, long-term organizational goals. In contrast, your CEO and CTO seem to be operating from a more traditional, perhaps hierarchical or power-centered perspective, equating empathy with a lack of authority. Here’s how you can manage this dynamic without needing to convince them of the validity of your approach directly:

1. **Frame your approach in terms of outcomes**: FLUX often stresses that *systems thinking* should emphasize results over methods when trying to align different stakeholders. You are already getting feedback that your leadership style is working—this is your leverage. Communicate that your style leads to tangible outcomes (higher performance, lower turnover, more cohesive teams). Make sure this is framed in terms of the metrics that matter most to them, such as efficiency, innovation, or bottom-line results.

2. **Preemptively establish autonomy with clear accountability**: FLUX advises setting up boundaries where the key stakeholders feel secure knowing when they can step in. You could present a clear results-driven plan that sets a specific time frame for assessing your team's success (e.g., quarterly reviews of key performance indicators). This allows them to see you’re open to accountability, but it buys you space to lead in your own way without interference until those checkpoints.

3. **Signal strategic flexibility, not opposition**: Rather than framing it as *“I’m right and you’re wrong,”* align your leadership philosophy with the overarching goals of the organization. Highlight how your methods contribute to their vision, but make it clear that you’re open to adjusting if results falter. This non-confrontational framing can help ease concerns and reduce the perceived threat to their authority.

4. **Utilize third-party validation**: If your leadership is working and creating a noticeable difference, encourage feedback to flow upwards. If possible, let their trusted people, like board members or other influential executives, recognize and comment on your success. This can shift the perception of your methods from something “different” to something “effective.”

By positioning yourself as outcome-focused, embracing accountability, and emphasizing your alignment with the company’s larger goals, you can help your CEO and CTO see that, regardless of leadership style differences, your approach is working. This strategy, drawn from FLUX Review’s systems thinking lens, frames leadership as a dynamic interplay of approaches, where the goal is effectiveness, not uniformity.
