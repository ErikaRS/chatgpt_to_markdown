As kids we were told that swimming after eating causes cramps. Is that really true? And if so it's it worth than any other source of exercise?

The belief that swimming after eating causes cramps is largely a myth. There is no strong scientific evidence to support the idea that swimming on a full stomach significantly increases the risk of cramps compared to other physical activities. 

Cramps during swimming can occur due to various reasons, such as dehydration, muscle fatigue, or poor conditioning, but they are not specifically linked to eating before swimming. While it's generally recommended to avoid heavy meals right before intense exercise to prevent discomfort, moderate eating before physical activities, including swimming, is usually fine. 

In summary, swimming after eating is not inherently more dangerous than any other form of exercise, and the risk of cramps is not significantly higher. It's always a good idea to listen to your body and avoid overexertion, regardless of the activity.
