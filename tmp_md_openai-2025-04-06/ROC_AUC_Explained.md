Help me understand the evaluation metric ROC AUC

### Assistant - 2023-05-26 10:54:09

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a statistical method that is widely used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models, that is, models that predict one of two outcomes, such as yes/no or true/false.

Here's a bit more detail on both parts of the concept, ROC and AUC:

**ROC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classification system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is created by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.

- True Positive Rate (also known as Sensitivity or Recall): This is the proportion of actual positive cases (for example, patients who actually have a disease) that the model correctly identified as positive (patients the model correctly diagnoses as having the disease).

- False Positive Rate (also known as 1-Specificity): This is the proportion of actual negative cases (for example, patients who do not have the disease) that the model incorrectly identified as positive (patients the model incorrectly diagnoses as having the disease).

**AUC**: The Area Under the Curve is literally the area underneath the ROC curve. It provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. It is used as a single number summary of the classifier performance. A perfect classifier would have an AUC of 1.0, while a random classifier (no better than random guessing) would have an AUC of 0.5.

In conclusion, the ROC AUC score gives us a good indication of how well the probabilities from the positive classes are ranked versus the negative classes. It is often used when the classes are imbalanced. The closer the AUC to 1, the better.

Can you show an example plot?

### Assistant - 2023-05-26 10:58:32

I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I'm not able to create visual plots or images. However, I can guide you through creating one using Python's Scikit-learn library.

Let's assume we have a binary classification problem with some predictions and true values stored in `y_true` and `y_pred` variables:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# These are just example values, replace with your actual data.
y_true = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1])
y_scores = np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.8, 0.5, 0.9, 0.7, 0.3, 0.6, 0.12])

fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_scores)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label='ROC curve (area = %0.2f)' % roc_auc)
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic Example')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
```

In the plot, the x-axis is the false positive rate (FPR) and the y-axis is the true positive rate (TPR). The dotted line in the middle of the graph represents a random classifier (AUC = 0.5) and the curve is the ROC curve of our model. The area under this curve is the AUC-ROC score. The closer this curve is to the top left corner, the better the classifier's performance is (AUC = 1).

Explain an LSTM RNN architecture in a way that would be understandable for a smart high school student.

### Assistant - 2023-05-26 11:07:21

Sure, let's give it a go!

Let's start with the term RNN, which stands for Recurrent Neural Network. You can think of a neural network like a very smart machine that learns patterns from data. It's like an ultra-flexible function in mathematics that can curve and twist itself to fit the pattern of the data it's learning from. Now, the word "recurrent" means that this network has loops in it. This is useful for when the order of the data matters, like in a sequence of words in a sentence, or a series of daily temperatures. 

However, regular RNNs have a problem. Imagine trying to remember the details of a movie you watched a year ago. It's pretty tough, right? That's because our memory fades over time, and the same thing happens in a regular RNN. The information it processes tends to get diluted over long sequences and it becomes hard for the network to learn from information that came a lot earlier (this is technically known as the problem of long-term dependencies).

Now, let's bring in LSTMs, which stands for Long Short-Term Memory. LSTMs are a special kind of RNN that are much better at remembering information for long periods, kind of like having a notepad where they jot down the important stuff to remember for later.

An LSTM has three "gates" to control information flow:

1. **Forget gate**: Here, the LSTM decides what information it wants to throw away from its notepad. Maybe it's something unimportant, like a random passerby in the movie. 

2. **Input gate**: Next, the LSTM decides what new information it wants to store in the notepad. Perhaps it's a new character that just came into the scene.

3. **Output gate**: Finally, based on the updated notepad, the LSTM decides what it wants to output. This output will be used for the task at hand, like predicting the next word in a sentence, or the temperature the next day.

By using these gates, the LSTM can learn longer sequences, making it great for tasks like understanding sentences, translating languages, or predicting time series data.

Remember, this is just a simplified explanation. The actual mechanism involves a bit more math, but this gives you a good intuitive understanding of how LSTMs work.

Not uplevel this to an explanation for a college student, focusing on the different outputs and what they mean.

### Assistant - 2023-05-26 11:08:31

Alright, let's delve into more specifics!

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is a specific type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), excels at learning from sequences of data by maintaining a sort of "memory" (captured in hidden states) over the sequence. This is accomplished by a system of gating mechanisms, each composed of a combination of a sigmoid activation function and pointwise multiplication operation.

Here are the core components:

1. **Forget gate (f)**: This decides what information we're going to throw away from the cell state. It's a sigmoid layer that outputs numbers between 0 and 1. A 1 means "completely keep this" while a 0 means "completely get rid of this."

2. **Input gate (i)**: The input gate layer decides which values we'll update or, in other words, what new information we're going to store in the cell state. This is again a sigmoid layer.

3. **Cell state (C)**: The cell state, or the "memory" of the LSTM, gets updated in this stage. We multiply the old state by `f` (forget gate) and then add the pointwise multiplication of the input gate `i` and the candidate values that could be added to the state, scaled by how much we decided to update each state value.

4. **Output gate (o)**: This gate decides what the next hidden state should be. The hidden state contains information on previous inputs. The hidden state is also used for predictions. 

To be more specific, let's consider `h_t` as the output at time step `t`, `c_t` as the cell state at time step `t`, `x_t` as the input at time step `t`. The LSTM computations can be formally described as:

- Forget gate: `f_t = sigmoid(W_f * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)`
- Input gate: `i_t = sigmoid(W_i * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)`
- Cell update gate: `C~_t = tanh(W_C * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)`
- New cell state: `c_t = f_t * c_{t-1} + i_t * C~_t`
- Output gate: `o_t = sigmoid(W_o * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)`
- New hidden state: `h_t = o_t * tanh(c_t)`

Here, `[h_{t-1}, x_t]` denotes the concatenation of `h_{t-1}` and `x_t`, and `*` denotes the dot product. `W` and `b` are the weights and biases respectively, and they are learned during the training process.

That's it! You just need to remember that the LSTM unit uses different combinations of its current input, previous output, and previous cell state to control what information gets passed along to the next time step. And that's how LSTM manages to keep longer term dependencies in the data.
