In a software engineering company with fewer than 100 engineers, the distribution between product engineers, security engineers, infrastructure engineers, and operations engineers can vary depending on the company's focus, product complexity, and stage of growth. Here’s a typical breakdown of these roles:

1. **Product Engineers:**
   - **Role:** Focus on developing features and functionality of the product. This group usually includes front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers.
   - **Proportion:** They often comprise the largest segment of the engineering team, ranging from 60% to 80% of the total engineering staff.

2. **Security Engineers:**
   - **Role:** Responsible for ensuring the security of the company's products and infrastructure, including implementing security best practices and responding to security incidents.
   - **Proportion:** This is typically a smaller team, especially in smaller companies, ranging from 5% to 10% of the engineering workforce.

3. **Infrastructure Engineers:**
   - **Role:** Focus on building and maintaining the technical infrastructure that supports the product. This includes cloud services, networks, and servers.
   - **Proportion:** Generally, this group can make up about 10% to 20% of the engineering team, depending on how much of the infrastructure is managed in-house versus outsourced or automated.

4. **Operations Engineers (Ops):**
   - **Role:** Often involved in system administration, monitoring, and supporting the operational aspects of the applications and infrastructure. This can include deployment and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes.
   - **Proportion:** Like security engineers, this team is usually small, around 5% to 10% of the total engineering staff, unless the company has specific needs that require a larger ops presence.

The specific numbers can fluctuate based on the company’s product, the industry, how much automation is employed, and whether certain functions are outsourced. As companies grow and evolve, these proportions might shift to accommodate new priorities and technologies.
