I brush off praise and am crushed by criticism. I assess as enneagram type 6 (loyalist) and 16 personalities / meyers-briggs Advocate (INFJ) or maybe ISFJ. I highly prioritize security and am generally change and risk averse.

How can I become more resilient in the face of criticism?

Building resilience, especially when facing criticism, is a journey that involves self-reflection, practicing self-compassion, and adopting certain mental frameworks that align with your Enneagram Type 6 (The Loyalist) and Myers-Briggs INFJ/ISFJ personality traits. Here's a tailored approach to help you navigate and grow through criticism:

### 1. **Understand Your Reaction to Criticism**
- As a Type 6, you naturally seek security and may perceive criticism as a threat to stability or reliability in relationships or environments. INFJ and ISFJ types tend to take criticism personally due to their deep sense of empathy and high expectations of themselves.
- Acknowledge this pattern as a first step. Recognize that your reaction is a natural part of your personality but can be managed and transformed into something constructive.

### 2. **Reframe Your Perspective on Criticism**
- Try to see criticism as an opportunity for growth rather than an attack. Constructive criticism, even though it may not always feel good, can be a valuable tool for personal and professional development.
- Remember, feedback is often more about the giver's perceptions, experiences, and expectations than an absolute truth about you or your abilities.

### 3. **Develop Emotional Agility**
- Emotional agility involves being flexible with your thoughts and feelings so that you can respond optimally to everyday situations. When you receive criticism, allow yourself to feel your initial emotional reaction, then step back to analyze those feelings objectively.
- Practice mindfulness or meditation to improve your ability to observe your emotions without immediately reacting to them.

### 4. **Cultivate Self-Compassion**
- Be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend in the same situation. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that growth comes from learning from these mistakes.
- Engage in positive self-talk and affirmations to counteract the negative thoughts that criticism might trigger.

### 5. **Seek Clarity**
- Sometimes, criticism can be vague or confusing. Don't hesitate to ask for specific examples or suggestions for improvement. This can turn a potentially disheartening experience into a clear pathway for growth.
- Clarifying also helps you understand the critic's perspective, which might be influenced by their own biases or expectations.

### 6. **Leverage Your Strengths**
- As an INFJ or ISFJ, you have a unique set of strengths, such as deep empathy, strong intuition, and a keen sense of duty. Use these strengths to your advantage when processing criticism. For example, empathy can help you understand where the critic is coming from, while your sense of duty can motivate you to improve.

### 7. **Create a Support System**
- Surround yourself with people who understand your personality and can offer you balanced perspectives. A support system can provide encouragement, reality checks, and constructive feedback.

### 8. **Set Boundaries**
- While it's important to be open to criticism, it's equally important to protect yourself from harmful or unwarranted negative feedback. Learn to differentiate between constructive and destructive criticism, and set boundaries to minimize exposure to the latter.

### 9. **Practice Resilience-Building Activities**
- Engage in activities that build your confidence and resilience. This could include setting and achieving small goals, journaling about your experiences and what you've learned from them, or participating in workshops or therapy sessions focused on resilience and emotional intelligence.

Building resilience is a personal and ongoing process. It requires patience and persistence, but by leveraging your innate qualities as a Type 6, INFJ, or ISFJ, you can transform the way you perceive and respond to criticism, turning it into a powerful tool for personal growth and development.
