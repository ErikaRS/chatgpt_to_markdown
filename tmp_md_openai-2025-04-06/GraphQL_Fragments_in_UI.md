Explain this comment for someone who is only passingly familiar with GraphQL or frontend development: Since I haven’t seen that mentioned in the RFC I wanted to point out that a huge benefit of GraphQL for UI/component development is the fact that components can define their data dependencies via fragments. That means we can change a component without having to change every callsite of it.
I can’t say how relevant this is in the grand scheme of things but I wanted to mention it at least.

Sure! Here's a simpler explanation:

In the context of frontend development, GraphQL is a tool used to get data from a server to display on a website or application. A powerful feature of GraphQL is something called **fragments**. These fragments let individual parts of the user interface (like buttons or cards) clearly define the specific data they need.

Imagine each component is like a small "building block" of the user interface that knows exactly what information it needs to function. With GraphQL fragments, you can change one of these components—say, you redesign a card to display extra details—**without having to go and change every part of your code where that card appears**. This makes the development process much smoother and faster because components manage their own data needs independently. It helps prevent a situation where changing one small piece means a lot of tedious updates elsewhere.

The commenter is saying that, while this might not be a groundbreaking point in every discussion about GraphQL, it's still a very helpful aspect when working with UI components.
