Explain how trigrams can be used to implement regular expression search

The task of using trigrams to implement regular expression (regex) search could be a bit tricky, but it can be made efficient and speedy using a few concepts.

First, a trigram is a sequence of three consecutive characters taken from a given text. For example, if we have the string "Hello", the trigrams are "Hel", "ell", and "llo". 

Here's a high-level approach to use trigrams for regex searching:

1. **Trigram Indexing**: The first step is to create a trigram index of all your text data. That means splitting all your text data into trigrams and associating these trigrams with their corresponding text. This step will give you a sort of "lookup table".

2. **Trigram Extraction from Regular Expression**: Regular expressions can be complicated, but many of them can be simplified down to a set of substring searches. You will need to extract trigrams from the regular expression pattern itself. For example, if your regex pattern is "/hel*/", the associated trigram would be "hel".

3. **Searching**: You then look for these trigrams in your trigram index. It will give you all texts that contain the trigrams from the regex pattern. This set of texts is a superset of all texts that match the regular expression.

4. **Filtering**: Finally, you perform the actual regular expression matching on this subset of texts. Since the subset is much smaller than your entire text corpus, this step is much faster than performing a regex search on the entire corpus.

Note that this is a very simplified and abstract description of this process. The actual implementation would involve dealing with a number of edge cases and could get quite complicated. Furthermore, this method might not be suitable for all types of regular expressions, particularly those that can't be easily broken down into trigrams.

To optimize this process, you might choose to use a combination of other searching techniques, such as inverted indices or B-trees, along with your trigram index. This will allow you to handle more complex regular expressions and improve the speed of your searches.

Describe how to extract a trigram search query from a regular expression

To use trigrams in a regular expression search, you must be able to extract useful trigrams from the regular expression itself. How you do this will depend on the specific regular expression.

First, not all regular expressions can be usefully converted into trigrams. If your regular expression is very broad or relies heavily on special characters or meta-sequences (like `\b`, `\d`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `.` etc.), it may not be possible to convert it into a set of trigrams that will make your search more efficient.

However, if your regular expression includes specific sequences of characters, you can break those sequences down into trigrams. For example, if your regular expression is `foo.*bar`, you could break this down into the trigrams `foo` and `bar`. 

Here are the general steps to extract trigrams from a regular expression:

1. **Identify Fixed-Length Substrings**: Look for substrings within the regular expression that are fixed (i.e., not influenced by any special characters like `*`, `+`, `.` etc.). From our example, `foo` and `bar` are the fixed substrings.

2. **Generate Trigrams**: If a substring is three characters or more, it can be directly considered a trigram. If a substring is more than three characters long, generate all possible trigrams from it.

3. **Smaller Substrings**: If the substring is smaller than a trigram (less than 3 characters), it might be less effective but could still be used. For instance, in a big data set, even bi-grams or uni-grams could help to significantly reduce the search space.

4. **Dealing with Special Characters**: If there are special characters (meta-characters or symbols), generally they are not included because their meaning is context-dependent in regular expressions. However, for certain sequences with special characters that have predictable and consistent meanings (like `\n`, `\t`, etc.), you could consider them in your trigram extraction based on your specific use-case.

Remember that this approach will only improve efficiency if your regular expressions tend to contain specific, recurring sequences of characters that can be broken down into trigrams. If your regular expressions don't have this property, a different approach may be needed. Also, this process might not be suitable for all types of regular expressions, particularly those that can't be easily broken down into trigrams.

How do the special characters for sequences get translated to and and or queries

### Assistant - 2023-07-06 20:00:51

In the context of trigrams and regular expressions, handling special characters can be a bit tricky. Special characters often denote specific conditions that don't easily translate into specific trigrams. However, we can understand how special characters can be mapped into logical `AND` and `OR` operations.

1. **Concatenation (AND)**: If two trigrams are concatenated in the regular expression, for example `foo.*bar`, this could be seen as an `AND` operation. In terms of search, we're looking for texts that contain `foo` AND `bar` (not necessarily in direct sequence due to the `.*` part). So the document or text must satisfy both conditions, i.e., have both trigrams.

2. **Alternation (OR)**: The pipe symbol (`|`) in a regular expression indicates an `OR` operation. For example, the regular expression `foo|bar` is looking for texts that contain either `foo` OR `bar`. So, if any of these trigrams is present in the text, it satisfies the condition.

3. **Character Sets and Wildcards**: These can be more complex. For example, a character set like `[abc]` could be translated into an `OR` operation, as it matches any one of `a`, `b`, or `c`. A wildcard `.` can match any character, so it can't be usefully translated into `AND`/`OR` operations with respect to trigrams. These would likely need to be handled separately from the trigram-based `AND`/`OR` operations.

4. **Quantifiers**: Regular expression quantifiers like `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n}`, `{n,}`, `{n,m}` represent repeating characters and can't be directly translated into `AND`/`OR` operations with respect to trigrams. They will need special handling depending on their exact usage.

Please note that this method can greatly reduce the size of the text corpus you need to perform a full regex match on, but it will not entirely eliminate the need for a regex match. After performing the `AND`/`OR` operations with trigrams, you should have a much smaller set of texts that may match your regex. You will still need to perform a full regex match on these texts to get your final results.
