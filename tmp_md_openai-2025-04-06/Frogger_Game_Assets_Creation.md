Recreate these with true transparent backgrounds. Make them pngs

### Assistant - 2024-11-20 20:41:21

I’ll process each of these images to ensure they have true transparent backgrounds and save them as PNGs. This will take a moment.

The frog asset has been processed with the #FF0000 background replaced by transparency. You can download it here:

[Frog PNG with transparent background](sandbox:/mnt/data/frog_transparent_corrected.png)

Shall I proceed with creating the car asset facing right?

No. Really, the background should be just #ff0000, no other shade, no other details. Try again

{"prompt":"A simple and cute pixel-art style frog facing forward, designed for a sprite-based game. The frog is vibrant green with expressive eyes and fills the area of the sprite. The background is a solid bright red (#FF0000), with no other shades, details, or elements.","size":"1024x1024"}

DALL·E displayed 1 images. The images are already plainly visible, so don't repeat the descriptions in detail. Do not list download links as they are available in the ChatGPT UI already. The user may download the images by clicking on them, but do not mention anything about downloading to the user.

Would you like me to proceed with the next asset, the car facing right?
