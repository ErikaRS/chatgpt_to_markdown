How to increase performance standards in an organization while also raising psychological safety?

### Assistant - 2023-08-11 17:46:13

Increasing performance standards while also raising psychological safety is a delicate balancing act. Here's a concise guideline:

1. **Set Clear Expectations**: Clearly communicate what you expect in terms of performance. When employees know what's expected, they can focus on meeting those expectations.

2. **Feedback Loops**: Create regular opportunities for feedback. This can be through one-on-ones, team meetings, or performance reviews. Feedback should be constructive, focusing on both strengths and areas of improvement.

3. **Encourage Open Communication**: Foster an environment where employees feel safe to voice their concerns, ideas, and feelings without fear of retaliation.

4. **Lead by Example**: Leadership should model the behaviors and standards they expect from their team.

5. **Provide Training & Resources**: Ensure employees have access to the necessary tools and training to perform at their best.

6. **Recognize & Reward**: Celebrate achievements and milestones. Recognition boosts morale and reinforces desired behaviors.

7. **Encourage Team Collaboration**: Teamwork often results in better outcomes. Encourage collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing.

8. **Address Mistakes Constructively**: Instead of punitive actions, view mistakes as learning opportunities. Discuss what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future.

9. **Establish Psychological Safety**: This means creating an environment where employees feel safe to take risks and voice their opinions without fear of punishment or humiliation.

10. **Continuous Improvement Mindset**: Emphasize that the goal isn't perfection, but continuous growth and improvement. This takes the pressure off being perfect and places importance on learning and adapting.

Balancing high performance with psychological safety is about creating an environment where employees are driven to excel while feeling supported and valued. It requires a combination of clear communication, supportive leadership, and an inclusive culture.

Adding some more context: we have an organization where we really need to up level the productivity of the organization as measured by code output and feature launches. The organization has some engineers who don't have high productivity and others who are highly productive but not focused on impact. 

The organization is also skittish because there have been a lot of changes both culturally and to the business model. 

How might one organize a change effort that helps people feel motivated to be more productive rather than fearful that the request for more productivity means their jobs are at risk?

### Assistant - 2023-08-11 17:54:36

Given the context, it's essential to approach this delicately, balancing the need for increased productivity with fostering a culture of trust and motivation. Here's a tailored plan for your change effort:

1. **Start with Transparent Communication**: Be open about the need to increase productivity and tie it back to the organization's mission, vision, and goals. Make it clear that this effort is about maximizing the potential of every team member and ensuring the organization's success rather than cutting jobs.

2. **Engage Leaders and Managers**: They play a pivotal role in setting the tone. Equip them with the tools and knowledge to support their teams through this transition.

3. **Individual Check-ins**: Managers should have one-on-one sessions with each team member. The goal is to understand their challenges, aspirations, and provide tailored feedback on performance and impact.

4. **Establish Clear Impact Metrics**: Ensure engineers understand the difference between simply being productive (coding) and creating impact (meaningful feature launches). Use Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) or a similar framework to align work with impact.

5. **Professional Development Opportunities**: Offer workshops, trainings, or resources that can help engineers improve their coding productivity, decision-making abilities, or any other skills that could help them become more impactful.

6. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Recognize and celebrate incremental progress, not just big achievements. This will help build momentum and morale.

7. **Establish Peer Mentorship Programs**: Pair highly productive engineers with those struggling in productivity. This can foster a culture of collaborative growth.

8. **Reiterate Psychological Safety**: Emphasize the importance of taking risks and innovating. Let employees know that while productivity is essential, it's okay to make mistakes as long as they learn and iterate.

9. **Provide Tools and Resources**: Sometimes, productivity is hampered by outdated tools or insufficient resources. Regularly check in with engineers to ensure they have what they need to be successful.

10. **Feedback Loops**: Implement regular feedback sessions where employees can voice concerns, ask questions, and provide insights into potential process improvements.

11. **Incentivize Impactful Work**: Offer bonuses, promotions, or other incentives for projects that have a measurable, positive impact on the organization.

12. **Avoid Micromanagement**: Trust your employees. Provide them with the autonomy they need to take ownership of their work and drive results.

13. **Cultural Workshops**: Since there've been cultural shifts, consider workshops that address and celebrate the new culture, helping employees understand and adjust.

14. **Job Security Reassurance**: Even though it's been communicated that the push for productivity isn't about job cuts, periodically reiterate this, especially if rumors or concerns arise.

15. **Feedback Collection**: Implement channels where employees can anonymously provide feedback about the change effort, allowing for course corrections if needed.

By approaching the push for productivity as an avenue for individual and collective growth, rather than merely a business need, you can foster a motivated and engaged workforce, even during challenging times.
