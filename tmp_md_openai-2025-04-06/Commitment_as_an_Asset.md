Some things FLUX has said about optionality and commitment are below. Draft up a FLUX lens about *commitment* which builds on these but adds some new angle. Remember that a flux lens should be short (4 paragraphs) where the first paragraph is an example, the second defines the lens. The third discusses some interesting implications, and the 4th has a practical takeaway statement. 



Optionality, Commitment, and Preparation (Unpredictable Patterns) — Observes that company leadership often likes to “keep its options open,” thinking this has no cost; in reality, never committing to anything slows down progress and hurts morale. If we work in an organization that stubbornly won’t commit, our best bet is to prepare for many possible situations so that we’re ready when the organization finally has to commit.

While scenario planning can help us keep our options more open, beware of using it as an excuse not to make decisions. Optionality has a cost, and taken to an extreme, if we never make decisions, then we’ll never reap any benefits. Let’s also avoid mistaking our explorations of different future scenarios for reliable predictions. Hold scenarios lightly, as a tool to inform our decision-making, not decide for us.



Introducing new ways to see the world and new tools to add to your mental arsenal.

This week’s lens: commitment device.

You want to write more publicly, so you commit to sharing a weekly newsletter. If you miss a deadline, you promise to sincerely and positively highlight an article from an author you typically disagree with. This consequence sharpens your focus, turning an abstract goal into a concrete, time-bound priority you’re motivated to hit.

Commitment devices align actions with intentions by linking them to meaningful stakes. They work best when there’s a linear, predictable relationship: “If I fail at X, then Y happens.” When the consequence is undesirable enough, we’ll be more incentivized to take action.

Commitment devices can effectively keep us on track, but relying too heavily on external pressure can create rigidity and stifle growth. A more flexible, adaptive approach is to view commitment devices as temporary scaffolding — supporting consistent action while intrinsic motivation is nurtured and internalized. The key is to design incentives that evolve with your goals and reveal insights about your actual drivers.

Ultimately, the most effective commitment devices aren’t just about enforcing discipline but about fostering deeper self-alignment. By using them to explore what truly drives you, you can design systems that gradually reduce the need for external enforcement. With this reflective approach, commitment devices become not just mechanisms for meeting goals, but instruments for cultivating long-term resilience and growth​.

### The Commitment Paradox

A startup founder is given a choice: pursue a lucrative but uninspiring partnership or double down on a riskier, more meaningful vision. Hesitating, they try to keep both paths open, delaying the decision in hopes that the “right” choice will reveal itself. But as time drags on, both options deteriorate—the partnership loses interest, and the bold vision fades into inaction. In trying to preserve optionality, they lose both possibilities. 

Commitment is often framed as a trade-off against flexibility, but in reality, it’s what enables real agency. By decisively choosing a path, we shift from passive observers to active shapers of our future. While optionality creates potential, commitment turns potential into momentum. The paradox is that committing doesn’t necessarily limit possibilities—it can actually create them by unlocking new capabilities, deepening relationships, and clarifying purpose. 

One implication of this paradox is that organizations and individuals often miscalculate the true cost of indecision. Keeping doors open feels safe, but it quietly drains energy and fractures focus. The most successful strategies don’t just hedge against risk; they strategically commit, treating commitment itself as a resource to be allocated wisely. Just as financial investments compound over time, so do commitments—when well-placed, they generate increasing returns in clarity, trust, and progress.

So, instead of seeing commitment as a burden, treat it as an asset. If a decision feels daunting, ask: what small, meaningful commitment could create forward motion? Start with micro-commitments—low-stakes, high-feedback actions that build confidence and insight. In this way, commitment becomes less about closing doors and more about opening deeper, more meaningful ones.

### The Commitment Paradox  

A consulting agency is given a choice: take on a lucrative but uninspiring client or hold out for work that aligns with its long-term vision. Hesitating, the agency tries to keep both options open, delaying the decision in hopes that a better opportunity will emerge. But as time drags on, the lucrative client moves on, and the ideal opportunity never materializes. In trying to preserve optionality, the agency ends up with neither revenue nor strategic progress.  

Commitment is often framed as a trade-off against flexibility, but in reality, it’s what enables real agency. By decisively choosing a path, we shift from passive observers to active shapers of our future. While optionality creates potential, commitment turns potential into momentum.
