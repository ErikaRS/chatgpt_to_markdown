For medium-thickness, straight hair with normal oiliness, washing your hair 2-3 times per week is generally ideal. This frequency allows your scalp to maintain its natural oils without becoming too greasy. Over-washing can strip those oils, leading to dryness, while under-washing can cause excess oil buildup.

You might also adjust based on specific needs, like washing more often after heavy sweating or product use. If your hair feels oily between washes, using a dry shampoo can help refresh it without the need for a full wash.

For medium-thickness, straight hair with normal oiliness, here’s a good wash, condition, dry, and style routine to maintain healthy and well-styled hair:

### 1. **Washing Routine**:
   - **Shampoo**: Use a sulfate-free shampoo to avoid stripping natural oils. Focus on massaging the scalp, where oil and dirt accumulate, and let the suds naturally clean the lengths as you rinse.
   - **Frequency**: Wash 2-3 times per week. Adjust based on activity level or oiliness. For more frequent washing, use a mild shampoo.

### 2. **Conditioning Routine**:
   - **Conditioner**: Apply a lightweight conditioner on the mid-lengths and ends of your hair, avoiding the scalp to prevent weighing it down.
   - **Leave-in Conditioner (Optional)**: If your hair feels dry at the ends, a small amount of leave-in conditioner or a detangling spray can add moisture without being heavy.
   - **Deep Conditioning**: Once a week, use a deep conditioning or hydrating hair mask to nourish and keep your hair soft.

### 3. **Drying Routine**:
   - **Towel Dry**: Gently pat or squeeze the water out using a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt. Avoid rubbing to reduce frizz and breakage.
   - **Air Dry or Blow Dry**:
     - **Air Dry**: If possible, let your hair air-dry to avoid heat damage. You can use a smoothing serum or light mousse for extra definition or control.
     - **Blow Dry**: If you need to blow dry, use a heat protectant spray first. Dry your hair on a low to medium heat setting and point the dryer downward for a sleek finish. A round brush can add volume and smoothness.

### 4. **Styling Routine**:
   - **Straight Hair**: Since your hair is naturally straight, a lightweight serum or smoothing cream can help control frizz and add shine.
   - **Heat Styling**: If you use heat tools like straighteners or curling irons, always apply a heat protectant. Limit heat styling to avoid damage.
   - **Natural Look**: For a more natural look, let your hair air-dry with a texturizing spray or sea salt spray to add light waves and movement.
   - **Updos/Loose Styles**: When styling, consider loose braids, buns, or ponytails to minimize breakage.

### Additional Tips:
   - **Avoid Over-brushing**: Brush your hair when it’s dry or mostly dry to avoid breakage. Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle when wet.
   - **Trimming**: Regular trims (every 6-8 weeks) help prevent split ends and maintain the shape of your hairstyle.
   - **Silk Pillowcase**: Consider using a silk pillowcase at night to reduce friction and keep your hair smoother.

This routine will help maintain the health of your hair while giving it flexibility for different styling options.
