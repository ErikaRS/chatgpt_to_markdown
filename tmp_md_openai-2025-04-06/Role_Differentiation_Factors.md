Redo Cody Prime given these notes from the team charter: 
Systems and services
Cody Prime:
End-to-end ownership of everything that helps manage and monetize the user experience, for both PLG and Enterprise.
Areas of ownership
Self-serve Cody
PLG accounts
User account management architecture
Subscriptions
As exposed from Self-Service / Cody Pro backend
As exposed from Sourcegraph Enterprise Portal (RFC#885)
Teams
Invites
Payment
… for self-service customer for Cody Pro
NOT anything enterprise-facing. (Tracking purchase orders, status, wire transfers, etc. is not something we want to get involved with…)
Cody licensing for Enterprise?
Analytics
Usage metering
License management
Billing
Abuse
Rate limiting
Proxying to LLMs
Cody Gateway


Type of ownership
a.) Systems-focused
b.) User-focused
c.) User journey-focused
Rob Rhyne: For me, it's user journey + system focused ownership. 
TODO: Decide.

Metrics
TODO
Project workflows
Sources of work:
Project
Example: Teams and invites
External requests
Example: Request for metrics based on teams vs individuals
Internal discoveries
Example: Sentry logs on #alerts-cody-gateway
On-call
Example: Mitigate abusive use of Claude Opus through Cody
Communication
Some outstanding questions:
How do we inform each other of progress?
Async standup
Frequency: daily
Content: done + planned + blockers
Progress on project(s) since last update with links to Linear where applicable. 
Plans for the day
Blockers, requests for help, announcements (e.g., “I’m OOO next Wed-Fri, so…”)
Value: being informed about everyone’s focus, as in both plans and achievements.
Weekly sync
Same as daily standups, but with a larger scope
Part of regular weekly 2-hour meetings
Linear-driven weekly status update
Notion is the source of truth for team mission and processes

What is the standard communication channel?
DM vs. public channel
Individual Slack messages < Slack threads < GitHub / Linear / RFCs


David Veszelovszki: +1 for public channels
Taras Yemets: +1 for public channels
#cody-prime-team - team space (status updates, requests, etc.)
#discuss-cody-prime - EPD-related discussions  
Slack vs doc vs PR - when do we use each?
David Veszelovszki: Let’s prefer channels where the conversation is contextual. Individual Slack messages < Slack threads < GitHub / Linear / RFCs
When do we move communications from one channel to another?
David Veszelovszki: I usually mention my GitHub messages on Slack, too, because multiple people signaled to me on the team in the past that their GitHub notifications were not set up in a way that’d make it easy for them to get notified reliably. Might Linear be a solution for this?
Taras Yemets decisions if discussed/made on Slack, should then be reflected in Notion (team specific) or GitHub/Linear (project specific).
How do we get each other’s attention during and out of hours?
Is there an on-call rotation?
What is everyone’s expectation with regard to on-call?
David Veszelovszki: Not being notified when I’m outside work hours. 🤷
Taras Yemets 
We can implement a primary and secondary on-call rotation during working hours. This approach allows us to have engineers on-call for more than 16 hours a day within their regular working hours. However, the drawback is that Chris would always be on-call, either as the primary or secondary engineer.
The engineer on call is responsible for triaging incoming requests and fixing urgent issues
What services do we support in on-call?
Taras Yemets
Cody Gateway
Abuse
Cody Analytics
Do we have entries in go/whodoinotify?
How do we decide on technical standards for the team?
If the current codebase doesn’t meet our technical standards, what’s our plan for remediating that?
David Veszelovszki
Let’s make sure our technical standards are in agreement with the Eng team and are documented in the handbook or docs.
Once we identify areas where we don’t meet those standards, let’s allocate time for bringing up our existing codebase to meet those standards.
Use PR reviews to ensure we meet our standards with new code.
How do we align on & document those standards?
How do we check & verify code against those standards?
David Veszelovszki
Existing code
Existing and new formatter+linter rules
Random checks as we touch the code
New code
CI
PR reviews
Do we have a mechanism for balancing standards against the present state, ensuring that we evolve our quality rather than trying to fix it all at once?
Taras Yemets
Bigger projects/features should go through the RFC where EPD can agree on the scope of changes and the milestones
Avoid refactoring for the sake of refactoring
How do we address technical debt?
The same questions for technical standards
Conflict resolution
TODO
Notes
From Cody org design doc: FY25 H1 Cody Org Design
Cody Core: 
End-to-end ownership of the in-client user experience for all customers, PLG & Enterprise 
Owns
Clients, including releases
Code Search would continue to own Cody Web
Agent
Cody Enterprise features in the Sourcegraph instance
Supporting different enterprise configurations
Overall usage of LLMs
Overall product architecture

Cody Prime:
End-to-end ownership of everything that helps with managing and monetizing the user experience, for both PLG and Enterprise
Owns
PLG accounts, teams, invites, and payment
Analytics, usage metering, license management, billing, abuse, rate limiting, proxying to LLMs
Cody Gateway


Overall account management architecture for Cody, including subscriptions, accounts, and licenses for both PLG and Enterprise

How do we feel about this?
David Veszelovszki- this is good, not too different from what we had before
Rob Rhyne very broad in terms of “Enterprise” - we could use some clarification?
	“Everything” that helps with managing & monetizing - Cody Ignore?
Chris Smith it’s a great definition - it will always be unclear and imprecise
	“I expect that we will ever have a precise definition of where the line is”
Kevin Chen I’d wager we’re in agreement at an overall level
	Do we have a clear/granular definition? No
	Reorg for the better - getting away from micro-optimization

End-to-end ownership of everything that helps with managing and monetizing the user experience, for both PLG and Enterprise
Define Enterprise
From technical standpoint - does "everything" include clients?
How do we prioritize monetization against building a coherent platform?
Cody Core team builds features - are we supporting those features or are we doing our own initiatives? What is our relationship with that team? “Helps with managing” implies a symbiosis. Are there capabilities we own to help enable Cody Core? Are we on Cody Core critical path?

Eric reflections:
What is our cadence for aligning with Cody Core?
How much of our time do we think we should spend on helping vs our own stuff?
60% Cody Prime
Things specific to our team’s charter and responsibilities, e.g. improvements around accounts or monetization experiments.
20% Cody Core
Chris Smith this is likely to be bigger for the foreseeable future (as high as 50%)
Until we have a clearer architecture, everything is going to be deeply intertwined
Client is deeply tied to gateway, gateway is deeply tied to the Cody instance
We may want to be careful how we frame “our own stuff” - we want to make sure we’re aligned to producing the best product (across all teams)
David Veszelovszki
How much of this bandwidth is providing help and assistance?
10% user & operational support (KTLO, “keeping the lights on”)
David Veszelovszki this was > 10% initially
Lately it’s been a lot quieter
This has room to expand
Responding to Abuse incidents
Chris Smith observation: 10% is pretty low for keeping a service operational
Kevin Chen our end customer isn’t the developer, it’s the user admin for the instance
So, contrasting with the Cody Core team, which presumably would be primarily concerned with the develops
Also, we don’t see ourselves with internal teams as our “customers”
10% slack space
Wiggle room to shift time for any other bucket as crises come up
On-call rotations:
Chris is 100% of the Cody PLG rotation
Cody Gateway on-call rotation - may be empty (Cezay & Chris Warwick)



Taras Yemets: What does ownership mean? Are we the only ones who touch the code? Do we help other people do PRs?
	David Veszelovszki: I’ve tried to collect our options for this here.
	
How Work Comes in
PFP project: we’ve decomposed it and we are working on it
Incident, team channel
Bug fixes
Kevin Chen or Rob Rhyne poking around in the product
Ideas for experiments that will impact key metrics
Product and design discovering issues via quantitative research
Design producing qualitative research that points to user experience problems
Customer support
We generally bring these up in channel - 70% of the time these generate a ticket
Chris Smith problems raised in Slack sometimes are treated with the seriousness of an incident
Abuse reports
Customer requests:
Reference:RFC PRIVATE 944 APPROVED: Escalation & Issues Management Process	
Team AIs:
Think about service catalog
What would we do if we could devote time to cleaning up our issues?
What is a coherent team mission?

End-to-end ownership of everything that helps manage and monetize the user experience, for both PLG and Enterprise.
Areas of ownership
Self-serve Cody
PLG accounts
User account management architecture
Subscriptions
As exposed from Self-Service / Cody Pro backend
As exposed from Sourcegraph Enterprise Portal (RFC#885)
Teams
Invites
Payment
… for self-service customer for Cody Pro
NOT anything enterprise-facing. (Tracking purchase orders, status, wire transfers, etc. is not something we want to get involved with…)
Cody licensing for Enterprise?
Analytics
Usage metering
License management
Billing
Abuse
Rate limiting
Proxying to LLMs
Cody Gateway


Type of ownership
a.) Systems-focused
b.) User-focused
c.) User journey-focused
Rob Rhyne: For me, it's user journey + system focused ownership. 
TODO: Decide.

Metrics
TODO
Project workflows
Sources of work:
Project
Example: Teams and invites
External requests
Example: Request for metrics based on teams vs individuals
Internal discoveries
Example: Sentry logs on #alerts-cody-gateway
On-call
Example: Mitigate abusive use of Claude Opus through Cody
Communication
Some outstanding questions:
How do we inform each other of progress?
Async standup
Frequency: daily
Content: done + planned + blockers
Progress on project(s) since last update with links to Linear where applicable. 
Plans for the day
Blockers, requests for help, announcements (e.g., “I’m OOO next Wed-Fri, so…”)
Value: being informed about everyone’s focus, as in both plans and achievements.
Weekly sync
Same as daily standups, but with a larger scope
Part of regular weekly 2-hour meetings
Linear-driven weekly status update
Notion is the source of truth for team mission and processes

What is the standard communication channel?
DM vs. public channel
Individual Slack messages < Slack threads < GitHub / Linear / RFCs


David Veszelovszki: +1 for public channels
Taras Yemets: +1 for public channels
#cody-prime-team - team space (status updates, requests, etc.)
#discuss-cody-prime - EPD-related discussions  
Slack vs doc vs PR - when do we use each?
David Veszelovszki: Let’s prefer channels where the conversation is contextual. Individual Slack messages < Slack threads < GitHub / Linear / RFCs
When do we move communications from one channel to another?
David Veszelovszki: I usually mention my GitHub messages on Slack, too, because multiple people signaled to me on the team in the past that their GitHub notifications were not set up in a way that’d make it easy for them to get notified reliably. Might Linear be a solution for this?
Taras Yemets decisions if discussed/made on Slack, should then be reflected in Notion (team specific) or GitHub/Linear (project specific).
How do we get each other’s attention during and out of hours?
Is there an on-call rotation?
What is everyone’s expectation with regard to on-call?
David Veszelovszki: Not being notified when I’m outside work hours. 🤷
Taras Yemets 
We can implement a primary and secondary on-call rotation during working hours. This approach allows us to have engineers on-call for more than 16 hours a day within their regular working hours. However, the drawback is that Chris would always be on-call, either as the primary or secondary engineer.
The engineer on call is responsible for triaging incoming requests and fixing urgent issues
What services do we support in on-call?
Taras Yemets
Cody Gateway
Abuse
Cody Analytics
Do we have entries in go/whodoinotify?
How do we decide on technical standards for the team?
If the current codebase doesn’t meet our technical standards, what’s our plan for remediating that?
David Veszelovszki
Let’s make sure our technical standards are in agreement with the Eng team and are documented in the handbook or docs.
Once we identify areas where we don’t meet those standards, let’s allocate time for bringing up our existing codebase to meet those standards.
Use PR reviews to ensure we meet our standards with new code.
How do we align on & document those standards?
How do we check & verify code against those standards?
David Veszelovszki
Existing code
Existing and new formatter+linter rules
Random checks as we touch the code
New code
CI
PR reviews
Do we have a mechanism for balancing standards against the present state, ensuring that we evolve our quality rather than trying to fix it all at once?
Taras Yemets
Bigger projects/features should go through the RFC where EPD can agree on the scope of changes and the milestones
Avoid refactoring for the sake of refactoring
How do we address technical debt?
The same questions for technical standards
Conflict resolution

Cody Prime:
End-to-end ownership of everything that helps with managing and monetizing the user experience, for both PLG and Enterprise
Owns
PLG accounts, teams, invites, and payment
Analytics, usage metering, license management, billing, abuse, rate limiting, proxying to LLMs
Cody Gateway


Overall account management architecture for Cody, including subscriptions, accounts, and licenses for both PLG and Enterprise

How do we feel about this?
David Veszelovszki- this is good, not too different from what we had before
Rob Rhyne very broad in terms of “Enterprise” - we could use some clarification?
	“Everything” that helps with managing & monetizing - Cody Ignore?
Chris Smith it’s a great definition - it will always be unclear and imprecise
	“I expect that we will ever have a precise definition of where the line is”
Kevin Chen I’d wager we’re in agreement at an overall level
	Do we have a clear/granular definition? No
	Reorg for the better - getting away from micro-optimization

End-to-end ownership of everything that helps with managing and monetizing the user experience, for both PLG and Enterprise
Define Enterprise
From technical standpoint - does "everything" include clients?
How do we prioritize monetization against building a coherent platform?
Cody Core team builds features - are we supporting those features or are we doing our own initiatives? What is our relationship with that team? “Helps with managing” implies a symbiosis. Are there capabilities we own to help enable Cody Core? Are we on Cody Core critical path?

Eric reflections:
What is our cadence for aligning with Cody Core?
How much of our time do we think we should spend on helping vs our own stuff?
60% Cody Prime
Things specific to our team’s charter and responsibilities, e.g. improvements around accounts or monetization experiments.
20% Cody Core
Chris Smith this is likely to be bigger for the foreseeable future (as high as 50%)
Until we have a clearer architecture, everything is going to be deeply intertwined
Client is deeply tied to gateway, gateway is deeply tied to the Cody instance
We may want to be careful how we frame “our own stuff” - we want to make sure we’re aligned to producing the best product (across all teams)
David Veszelovszki
How much of this bandwidth is providing help and assistance?
10% user & operational support (KTLO, “keeping the lights on”)
David Veszelovszki this was > 10% initially
Lately it’s been a lot quieter
This has room to expand
Responding to Abuse incidents
Chris Smith observation: 10% is pretty low for keeping a service operational
Kevin Chen our end customer isn’t the developer, it’s the user admin for the instance
So, contrasting with the Cody Core team, which presumably would be primarily concerned with the develops
Also, we don’t see ourselves with internal teams as our “customers”
10% slack space
Wiggle room to shift time for any other bucket as crises come up
On-call rotations:
Chris is 100% of the Cody PLG rotation
Cody Gateway on-call rotation - may be empty (Cezay & Chris Warwick)



Taras Yemets: What does ownership mean? Are we the only ones who touch the code? Do we help other people do PRs?
	David Veszelovszki: I’ve tried to collect our options for this here.
	
How Work Comes in
PFP project: we’ve decomposed it and we are working on it
Incident, team channel
Bug fixes
Kevin Chen or Rob Rhyne poking around in the product
Ideas for experiments that will impact key metrics
Product and design discovering issues via quantitative research
Design producing qualitative research that points to user experience problems
Customer support
We generally bring these up in channel - 70% of the time these generate a ticket
Chris Smith problems raised in Slack sometimes are treated with the seriousness of an incident
Abuse reports
Customer requests:
Reference:RFC PRIVATE 944 APPROVED: Escalation & Issues Management Process	
Team AIs:
Think about service catalog
What would we do if we could devote time to cleaning up our issues?
What is a coherent team mission?
