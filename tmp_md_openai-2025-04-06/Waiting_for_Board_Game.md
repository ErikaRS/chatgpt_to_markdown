(To the tune of the Jeopardy theme)

Verse 1:
In this room we sit and stare,
Hoping soon you’ll move your piece there.
Clock is ticking, time’s not free,
Waiting for your turn, oh gee.

Chorus:
Da-da-da, da-da-da, 
Can you move? It’s been a while.
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
Let's progress, bring back the smile.

Verse 2:
Thinking hard, or just delayed?
Our patience tested, plans waylaid.
Every moment lingers on,
Still no move, what’s going on?

Chorus:
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
Time to act, the board awaits.
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
Hurry now, before it’s late.

Bridge:
Strategy, or mere distraction?
Hoping soon we'll see some action.
The game’s at stake, the tension grows,
When you’ll play, nobody knows.

Chorus:
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
Moments pass, yet here we sit.
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
Take your turn, or forfeit it.

End:
And as the melody starts to fade,
Your move is made, the wait repaid.
The game goes on, our spirits lift,
Your turn is done, now it’s my shift.
