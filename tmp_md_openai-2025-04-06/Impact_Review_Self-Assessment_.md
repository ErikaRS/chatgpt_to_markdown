Help me summarize these monthly updates into an impact review self assessment (performance review). 

The questions in the impact review:
Looking back over the past review period, how would you rate your performance against the expectations of your role, level and our values? Please provide specific examples in the comment field that justifies your performance rating. Where did you excel? Where do you need improvement?

What goals are you setting for yourself over the next 12 months to be successful?

Please share any additional feedback that may be helpful for your manager to review as a part of your self-review assessment.

(The monthly updates will follow)

### Assistant - 2024-02-26 07:14:26

Certainly! Please go ahead and share the monthly updates you'd like to summarize for your impact review self-assessment.

Aug-Oct

What‚Äôs working well? (Think about the past month and identify aspects of your work or projects that have been successful.)
In my new(ish) co-Head of Engineering role, Steve and I have found a good balance of sharing responsibilities. We both clearly focus on our own area while not being afraid to speak up when we have thoughts relevant to other domains.
Graph team new direction is sticking with the team. They still have doubts about focusing less on compiler-based precise, but they are bought on to the value of improving zero-config.
New eng ladder update has got some good feedback and stimulated some good discussions.

What‚Äôs not working well? (Recognize any challenges, obstacles, or areas where improvement is needed.)
I have delayed for 2 weeks writing down the impact of the reduced focus on compiler-based precise for GTM
Managing a team of ICs and being Head of Engineering is a lot. With Thorsten going back to being an IC, this problem will get worse until we get that EM, Platform hired.

Describe recent feedback you gave to your manager, teammate or direct report and its impact.
Thorsten: Coaching on IC vs manager track. Impact: Thorsten is going back to being an IC.
Nelson: Ask questions when you feel a statement misrepresents your team's work. Impact: Feedback was received well, but it's too early to see if it is acted on.
Varun and Anton: We need to value zero-config because it's the default experience and we know it can be better. Impact: They still believe there's a meaningful gap between compiler-based precise and the best we can do on zero-config but they are bought in to improving zero-config.
Auguste: Conversations about burnout concerns. Impact: He moved to a team that made him happier (credit there mostly goes to the Cody team and their offsite though üòÅ)
Peter: The team knows a lot about how to make Code Search better. Impact: Between hearing that feedback from me and hearing in the PFP reviews to focus on the core workflow, the team is getting a better plan of what to focus on.

### Assistant - 2024-02-26 07:18:04

Now that you've provided a comprehensive overview of your achievements and challenges from August to January, let's create a self-assessment that captures your performance, highlights your accomplishments, identifies areas for growth, sets future goals, and offers additional feedback for your manager.

### Performance Rating Justification

**Performance Against Expectations:**

Throughout the review period, I believe my performance as co-Head of Engineering has been highly effective and aligns with the expectations for my role, level, and our values. Specific examples include:

- **Collaboration and Leadership:** Successfully shared the Head of Engineering role with Steve, balancing responsibilities and fostering open communication across domains.
- **Strategic Initiatives:** Led the Graph team towards embracing a new direction focused on improving zero-config experiences, demonstrating flexibility and innovation.
- **Feedback and Development:** Updated the engineering ladder, which stimulated constructive discussions and feedback, showcasing my commitment to team growth and development.
- **Operational Excellence:** Efficiently managed logistics like All Hands planning, budgeting, and software audits, ensuring smooth operations within the engineering department.

**Areas of Excellence:**

- **Execution and Impact:** Proud of driving significant improvements in Code Search, particularly through focused execution and strategic planning offsites, which enhanced both the Search Suite and Search Platform teams' outputs.
- **Team Development:** Successfully onboarded new team members and facilitated transitions, such as Thorsten moving back to an IC role, and hiring for the EM Platform, demonstrating effective team management and development skills.
- **Strategic Hiring:** Played a crucial role in interviewing and onboarding for critical positions, strengthening the team's capabilities and preparing for future challenges.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **Timeliness:** Experienced delays in documenting the impact of strategic shifts, such as the reduced focus on compiler-based precision, highlighting a need for better time management.
- **Workload Management:** Managing dual roles of team leadership and Head of Engineering has been challenging, especially with the departure of team members to IC roles. This indicates a need for improved delegation and possibly expanding the leadership team to distribute responsibilities more effectively.

### Goals for the Next 12 Months

1. **Leadership Transition:** Successfully manage Steve's role change, ensuring a smooth transition and maintaining team stability.
2. **Strategic Hiring:** Aim to finalize hiring for the EM, Product Platform positions, strengthening our leadership team and enhancing our operational capabilities.
3. **Project Execution:** Focus on the successful launch of key projects, including Cody Enterprise, PLG improvements, and Code Search milestones, ensuring they deliver clear value-add to our users.
4. **Risk Management:** Actively work on derisking projects and focusing on known risk areas such as PLG, JetBrains integration, and architecture, ensuring stable and scalable solutions.
5. **Process Improvement:** Collaborate with the executive team to revise and improve the product planning and execution process, enhancing our efficiency and effectiveness in delivering projects.

### Additional Feedback

I would appreciate more support in balancing the dual responsibilities of team management and strategic leadership, possibly through additional leadership hires or more structured delegation processes. This support would help alleviate workload challenges and allow for a more focused approach to strategic projects and team development.

---

This assessment synthesizes your contributions and challenges over the past months while setting a clear direction for future growth. Feel free to adjust or expand upon any sections to better reflect your experiences or goals.

Based on all my notes, any thoughts on what feedback I might write for my manager in answer to these questions: 
- My manager enabled me to do my best work over the past review period. Please provide specific examples in the comment field that support if and how your manager enabled your success over the past review period. Where did they excel? Where do they need improvement?
- What support do you need from your manager to be successful in the next 12-months?
- Please share any additional feedback that may help your manager grow in the next review period.

(Note that my manager is the person who drove my promotion from manager to Head of Eng)

### Assistant - 2024-02-26 07:52:30

Given the comprehensive goals and achievements outlined, here are some suggestions for feedback for your manager, structured around the questions provided:

### Manager Enabled Success

**Positive Feedback:**
- My manager played a pivotal role in my transition from manager to Head of Engineering, providing mentorship and support that were crucial during this significant career shift. Their guidance on strategic planning, especially in defining and executing the roadmap for unifying Cody & Code Search, was instrumental in navigating complex product decisions and aligning the team towards common goals.
- They excelled in fostering an environment that encourages collaboration and clear communication, particularly between the engineering and GTM teams. This not only enhanced our product development process but also improved our go-to-market strategies, directly contributing to the team's and my personal success.
- The opportunity to work closely on revising the EM ladder and refining the planning process provided me with invaluable insights into effective team management and operational excellence, further enabling my growth in the leadership role.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- While their support has been fundamental, greater clarity on expectations and objectives at the outset of major projects could enhance decision-making and strategic direction. Setting clearer benchmarks for success for projects like the architectural roadmap and tech debt repayment could further empower me to drive these initiatives with more autonomy and precision.

### Support Needed for Success in the Next 12 Months

- As we continue to evolve our product and team structures, ongoing mentorship in strategic decision-making and navigating organizational changes will be crucial. Specifically, guidance on hiring strategies for key positions (e.g., a manager for the Cody teams) and budget advocacy would significantly impact our ability to scale effectively and meet our ambitious goals.
- Support in developing a more agile and responsive planning process would enable us to adapt more quickly to market demands and internal challenges, fostering a more innovative and resilient engineering culture.

### Additional Feedback for Manager's Growth
