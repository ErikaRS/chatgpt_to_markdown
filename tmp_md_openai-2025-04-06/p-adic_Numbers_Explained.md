What are p-adic numbers

### Assistant - 2023-05-28 12:37:37

P-adic numbers are an extension of the rational numbers, which are different from the usual (real or complex) numbers in that they have a different absolute value, and consequently, a different metric, or notion of "distance". These numbers were first described by the German mathematician Kurt Hensel in 1897. The "p" in p-adic refers to a prime number.

Here's the intuition behind p-adic numbers:

Consider how we can represent numbers in decimal notation. For example, we can represent 1/7 as a repeating decimal 0.142857142857... . Now, consider the number 0.3333... = 1/3. If we add more and more 3s to the end of this decimal, we get closer and closer to 1/3. This is similar to how we consider distance in our ordinary, real-number system, where 1/3 is a limit of numbers like 0.3, 0.33, 0.333, and so on.

Now, instead of considering a decimal (base 10) number system, imagine a system based on a prime number, say 3 (this would be the 3-adic numbers). In this system, adding more and more 3s at the *beginning* of a number brings us closer to a limit. So, for instance, ...333 is a valid number in this system. The "distance" between numbers in the p-adic system is different from our usual sense of distance; it depends on the highest power of p that divides the difference between the numbers.

This new metric and the corresponding algebraic structure have proven to be very useful in number theory and other branches of mathematics. For example, p-adic numbers are used in local-global principles in number theory, like the Hasse principle, and in the study of solutions to Diophantine equations. They are also used in algebraic geometry and representation theory.

Explain why characters in a world where distance is based on 3-adic would find it challenging.

There are several counterintuitive properties of the p-adic metric, compared to the standard Euclidean metric that we're used to, that could make it challenging for characters to navigate a world based on a 3-adic metric. Here are some examples:

1. **Non-Archimedean Property**: In the 3-adic world, the distance between two points doesn't increase if you move one of the points further away. For example, in the 3-adic metric, the distance between 9 and 0 (which is 3^2 and 3^0, respectively) is the same as the distance between 0 and 3^10. This is called the non-archimedean property, and it's very different from what we're used to in Euclidean geometry, where moving a point further away increases the distance.

2. **Different Notion of Closeness**: The notion of "closeness" or "proximity" is also different in a 3-adic world. For example, in the 3-adic metric, the number 3 is closer to 0 than to 1, because the highest power of 3 that divides (3-0) is higher than the highest power of 3 that divides (3-1).

3. **No Notion of Angles or Circles**: In a p-adic world, there's no equivalent of the Euclidean idea of an angle or a circle. Instead, "balls" in the p-adic metric are cubes in the corresponding real space. This could make traditional navigation and movement concepts difficult or impossible to apply.

4. **Triangle Inequality is Different**: In a 3-adic world, the triangle inequality (which in the Euclidean world says that the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the length of the third side) becomes a kind of "ultrametric inequality": the length of one side of a triangle is *less than or equal* to the maximum of the lengths of the other two sides. This means that in a p-adic world, you can have "triangles" where one side is no longer than either of the other two sides, which would be very counterintuitive for inhabitants used to Euclidean geometry.

So, overall, characters in a 3-adic world would have to deal with a very different sense of "distance," "closeness," and basic geometric concepts, which could be very challenging and counterintuitive.
