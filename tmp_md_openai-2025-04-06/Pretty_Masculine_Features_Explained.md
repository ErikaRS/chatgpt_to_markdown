When you describe a man as "pretty" without them looking feminine, you're likely picking up on features that are traditionally associated with attractiveness, symmetry, and gracefulness rather than masculinity or femininity. Some traits that could contribute to this perception include:

1. **Facial Symmetry**: A symmetrical face is often considered aesthetically pleasing and contributes to a sense of beauty.
  
2. **Defined Jawline and Cheekbones**: Strong, well-defined bone structure can be striking and aesthetically "pretty" without being feminine.

3. **Clear, Smooth Skin**: Skin texture can enhance someone's appearance, making their face seem more refined or delicate without suggesting femininity.

4. **Expressive or Bright Eyes**: Large, bright, or uniquely colored eyes can give a man a softer or more captivating appearance that might be described as pretty.

5. **Fuller Lips**: While thin lips might be seen as more traditionally masculine, fuller lips can create a balance of strength and softness in the face, contributing to a "pretty" aesthetic.

6. **Harmonious Features**: Men with well-balanced proportions and features that work together in a way that draws attention might be perceived as pretty, even with masculine characteristics.

7. **Hair Texture or Style**: Shiny, well-groomed hair that complements the face can add to this "pretty" look without detracting from a man's masculinity.

Overall, it's the combination of these traits, particularly when balanced with confidence or subtle charisma, that can create a pretty appearance while remaining distinctly masculine.
