  "prompt": "A cozy wall of reading nooks, each designed with a comfortable seating area, warm lighting, and filled with bookshelves. The nooks are set within a rustic brick wall, with each nook having its own unique style—some with plush armchairs, others with built-in benches and soft cushions. Soft, ambient lighting from wall-mounted lamps creates a welcoming atmosphere. The floor is wooden, and there are small side tables beside some of the nooks, with potted plants and coffee cups placed on them. The overall scene is inviting and perfect for getting lost in a good book."

Make them narrower in depth

{
  "size": "1024x1024",
  "prompt": "A cozy wall of reading nooks with narrower depth, each designed with a comfortable seating area, warm lighting, and filled with bookshelves. The nooks are set within a rustic brick wall, with each nook having its own unique style—some with plush armchairs, others with built-in benches and soft cushions. The nooks are shallower, providing a more intimate and snug feel. Soft, ambient lighting from wall-mounted lamps creates a welcoming atmosphere. The floor is wooden, and there are small side tables beside some of the nooks, with potted plants and coffee cups placed on them. The overall scene is inviting and perfect for getting lost in a good book."

Create an image of a built in bench along a wall turned into reading nooks

### Assistant - 2024-09-02 08:47:53

{
  "size": "1024x1024",
  "prompt": "A built-in bench along a wall that has been turned into cozy reading nooks. The bench is divided into several sections, each forming a small, intimate nook with comfortable cushions and pillows. Above the bench, there are built-in bookshelves filled with books. Each nook has its own small lamp or light fixture, casting a warm glow. The wall is a soft, neutral color, and the overall design is modern and minimalist, yet cozy. The floor is wooden, and there are small tables near the nooks, some with plants or coffee cups. The scene is inviting, perfect for reading or relaxing."
