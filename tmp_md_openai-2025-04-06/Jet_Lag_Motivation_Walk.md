I'm jet lagged. Motivate me to walk instead of taking a nap

Getting out and moving around will help reset your internal clock more quickly, which means better rest and more energy tomorrow. A brisk walk in fresh air can help you shake off that grogginess by getting your blood flowing and bringing in some natural light, a strong signal to your body that it’s time to be awake. Plus, even a short stroll can boost your mood and get your mind a bit more engaged, which will make the next night’s sleep even more restful. Would it help to set a goal—like finding a new café or park—to add a bit of fun or curiosity to the outing?

Be more like a good caring but slightly pushy friend

Alright, listen up! I know you *think* a nap sounds like the best plan, but trust me, you’ll feel way better if you get out there and move a bit. Just a quick walk—15 or 20 minutes. You’ll get some fresh air, clear your head, and feel way more human. Plus, your sleep tonight will be that much better. I’ll be here cheering you on. So grab your shoes, bundle up if you need to, and get moving! You’ll thank yourself (and maybe me) later.
