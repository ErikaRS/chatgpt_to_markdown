My boss doesn't understand the difference between leadership sharing a strategy and leadership telling people what to do. As a result, he refuses to come up with a coherent strategy because he worries that he will be telling people what to do and they'll stop thinking for themselves. How can I educate him on the difference?

This is a rich, nuanced challenge—getting at the heart of how leadership should guide without micromanaging. Let’s unpack both the distinction and the path you could take to help your boss shift their mindset.

### **Key Distinctions: Strategy vs. Directive**
| **Strategy (Leadership's Role)** | **Telling People What to Do (Micromanagement)** |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Defines **goals**, **priorities**, and **why** they matter | Specifies **exact tasks**, **how** to do them |
| Clarifies **trade-offs** and **boundaries** | Assumes no flexibility or judgment from team |
| Encourages **initiative** within a shared direction | Replaces thinking with compliance |
| Provides a **framework for decision-making** | Removes the need for decisions altogether |
| Is **iterative** and benefits from **feedback** | Is static and top-down |

You could share this table or use a metaphor to make it more intuitive—like how a **compass** gives you a direction but doesn't tell you which exact step to take, while micromanagement is like giving someone GPS turn-by-turn for a path you haven't walked yourself.

### **Skills and Roles at Play**
Your boss may be conflating:
- **Strategic leadership** (setting vision, context, and constraints)
- **Tactical autonomy** (trusting teams to figure out how best to get there)
- **Execution control** (directing specific moves)

Helping him distinguish those roles can unlock a healthier leadership pattern. For example:
- A **coach** outlines the game plan, but doesn’t play the game.
- A **general** sets objectives and rules of engagement, but field commanders adapt in real time.
- A **product leader** aligns on outcomes, not features.

---

### **How to Help Him Shift**
1. **Ask, don't tell:** Prompt him with questions like:
   - “How will people know they’re making the right decisions if we don’t define what good looks like?”
   - “If we’re not sharing priorities, how can we expect alignment?”

2. **Introduce language that decouples strategy from micromanagement:**
   Try reframing:  
   - “We’re not prescribing solutions—we’re aligning on outcomes and principles.”
   - “Strategy is a scaffolding, not a straitjacket.”

3. **Show examples:** Highlight where lack of strategy is *already* causing people to freeze or diverge because they **don’t** know the boundaries or goals. Use concrete data or anecdotes if you have them.

4. **Offer a model:** Bring in simple frameworks like OKRs, North Stars, or Amazon’s “tenets” model to show how leadership can set context without narrowing creativity.

5. **Create a safe experiment:** Propose co-creating a lightweight “strategy brief” for one area. Emphasize it as a draft or directional document to see if it helps more than hinders.

### **Reflect on This Later**
- How did your boss respond to having the distinction drawn out?
- Did any metaphors or frameworks resonate more than others?
- What signs do you see that the team *needs* more strategic guidance?

By reflecting on the impact of your approach—and how people respond—you’ll grow not just in your ability to manage up, but also in shaping a healthier leadership culture overall.

To acknowledge his point that it's important to get as broad a viewpoint as possible, how might I discuss a balance where we get broad input into strategy but still ensure it is aligned?

### Assistant - 2025-04-01 20:41:45

That’s a great instinct—meeting him where he’s coming from while helping him see the missing piece. Here’s how you might approach the balance:

### **Core Idea: Strategy as a Shared Construction, Not a Solo Edict**

You can frame strategy as a **conversation**, not a command—a balance between **inclusive input** and **clear direction**. Here’s a structured way to talk about it:

#### **1. Acknowledge the Value of Broad Input**
- “You're absolutely right that strategy benefits from broad perspectives. It surfaces edge cases, stress-tests assumptions, and often reveals better paths forward.”
- “People are more invested in a strategy they helped shape. That makes execution faster and more adaptive.”

#### **2. Highlight the Risk of Unresolved Divergence**
- “But without synthesis and direction, we risk splintering into well-intentioned efforts that pull in different directions.”
- “People might work hard on solving the wrong problems or miss key trade-offs we need to be making together.”

#### **3. Propose a Model of Inclusion + Alignment**
- “What if we treated strategy like a funnel?”  
  **Top of funnel:** Invite broad input on customer needs, market trends, internal strengths/gaps  
  **Middle:** Use leadership judgment to synthesize, prioritize, and highlight tensions  
  **Bottom:** Publish a clear strategy that reflects that synthesis, with space to iterate

You can use visuals or metaphors to make it stick:
- **Strategy as a riverbed:** The team brings water from many sources, but leadership shapes the bed so the flow goes in one direction.
- **Strategy as an editorial process:** Many reporters contribute stories, but the editor ensures there’s a coherent front page.

---

### **Language You Could Use**
> “The best strategies aren’t decreed—they’re **forged** from good inputs. But if we don’t take a stance, we stay in a swirl of ideas without momentum. Alignment doesn’t mean ignoring input; it means being accountable for focus.”

---

### **Reflect Later**
- Did he respond to the collaborative framing of strategy?
- Did he show more openness when strategy was presented as a response to inputs, not a replacement for them?
- Are there opportunities for him to **own the synthesis** part, not just the collection?

This balance—open input, synthesized direction—is a hallmark of mature strategic leadership. You're helping him move toward it.
