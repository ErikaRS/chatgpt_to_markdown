I will send several messages with fragments of text. For now, just accept the text as input. The fragments will be delineated by [START] and [END] tags.

### Assistant - 2023-07-03 17:54:13

Sure, I understand. Please go ahead and send your fragments of text marked with the [START] and [END] tags.

Who am I? This is a complicated question that we will each spend a lifetime answering. However, one aspect of who we are is the masks we wear. (Pair this with quote about roles, parts, masks from grace of kings and maybe make that the book)

What are masks? Are they part of us? Are they artifices we put on?

They can be both. "We wear the mask that grins and lies". Paul Philip Dunbar's classic poem of racial coding rhymes with the titular narrative of whistling Vivaldi. Some masks are ones we put on to hide, to protect ourselves. These two examples come from racial minorites using masks to protect themselves, literally, from racism. Those who has been in the position of being a member of a minority in a place where they have less power than those around them likely has one of these masks in their collection.

Other masks are more like the facets of a gemstone. We show them to others based on circumstance. We are one person with family. One with this set of friends and another with that. Yet another with coworkers. None of these facets is our whole self. None of them could be. We each contain multitudes. However, they are not false either. They reflect a true aspect of our personality.

If our selves are well integrated, we are like a cut gem. It is impossible to see our whole selves at once. If you are looking at one side, some are peaking through but others are completely hidden. Twisting and turning it can show the whole picture but never all at once. However, each facet matters. When we look at one, the light reflected from the others are a critical part of making the one we see sparkle. You may not go see fast and furious with this set of friends or read seeing like a state with your family, but all of our facets reflect light to make up the beautiful whole that is each of us.

When our masks are not integrated, we might be like a gem still partially cut. The facets don't yet reflect light to each other, but they still reflect a whole. We are all imperfect gems grinding against the bunting wheel of life to get, we hope, incrementally more sparkly. Other masks, like those masks of protection, are artificially placed on top of our natural facets. Left in place too long, especially because of necessarily, these masks may feel like a true part of our selves but if they don't help our whole selves sparkle, then they will make us feel less. It can take hard work — and sometimes professional help — to grind these masks away.

Sometimes we might look for our "true" selves, the self behind all of these masks. Perhaps this is the wrong way to put it. We each do have a private self, the one that we show to no one else, not even those closest to us. And that self may have delicate beauty but also the flaws we just fear showing, perhaps even to ourselves. What if, instead of thinking of this self, delicate and beautiful as it is, as our true self, we let this self image be one of the many facets of our self diamond. It refracts light a certain way and helps make the diamond whole. But the other faces are just as real. It is only together that they make a strong, sparkling whole.

The beautiful thing about our gemlike selves is that we no longer need to be too concerned about our separate masks. Our "true" self, is not a separate mask. Our true self is the three dimensional whole that is inseparable from the two dimensional facets that make up it's surface. We can value and cherish each of these facets even as we grind them toward something better. Even the obscured ones, we can thank for their role of protection even as we wait for the day when we can restore our full sparkle.

Key thing about true self that is false is that it is somehow stable, constant

Thank you for sending this additional text. How can I assist you further with these fragments?

Where the gem metaphor falls down is that for us, change is not just about taking away what is there. We can also grow and add new material to work with throughout our lives. In fact, doing so is vital. If our current self were a refined version of our childhood selves, no matter how beautiful the refinement, it would be a smaller, less rich self than we are with all of the material of our lives, good and bad.

Thank you for sharing this further extension of the metaphor. How may I assist you with these pieces of text?

### User - 2023-07-03 17:54:52

The grinding metaphor is apt. We aren't just molding ourselves painlessly like clay. We are rubbing up against life and sometimes that hurts
[END]

Sure, I'll combine these fragments into a single piece, while keeping as much of the original phrasing as possible.

Who am I? This is a complicated question that we each spend a lifetime answering. An aspect of who we are is the masks we wear. These masks can be both a part of us and artifices we put on. "We wear the mask that grins and lies," a line from Paul Laurence Dunbar's classic poem, harmonizes with narratives like Whistling Vivaldi. Some masks are our shield against the world, our defense mechanism to hide or protect ourselves, particularly if we find ourselves a minority amidst a dominant culture.

Yet, masks can also be seen as the facets of a gemstone. We present different aspects of ourselves based on the circumstances. We are one person with our family, another with our friends, and yet another with our coworkers. None of these facets represents our whole self. They each contain multitudes and are not false either. They reflect a true aspect of our personality.

Our selves, if well integrated, are like a cut gem. It is impossible to see our entire selves at once. Each facet matters. When we look at one, the light reflected from the others is a crucial part of making the one we see sparkle. If our masks are not integrated, we might be more like a gem still partially cut. The facets don't yet reflect light to each other, but they still reflect a whole. We are all imperfect gems grinding against the buffing wheel of life to get, we hope, incrementally more sparkly.

The key misinterpretation about our true self is that it is somehow stable and constant. But we can grow and add new material to work with throughout our lives. The refinement of our current self compared to our childhood selves does not make us smaller or less rich. On the contrary, it adds more facets to our life gem.

The grinding metaphor is apt. We aren't just molding ourselves painlessly like clay. We are rubbing up against life, and sometimes that hurts. Artificially placed masks, like those of protection, can feel like a true part of our selves. But if they don't help our whole selves sparkle, they will make us feel less. It can take hard work — and sometimes professional help — to grind these masks away.

Sometimes we might look for our "true" selves, the self behind all of these masks. Instead of thinking of this self as our true self, we could let this self-image be one of the many facets of our self-diamond. It refracts light a certain way and helps make the diamond whole.

Our "true" self is not a separate mask. Our true self is the three-dimensional whole that is inseparable from the two-dimensional facets that make up its surface. We can value and cherish each of these facets even as we grind them toward something better. Even the obscured ones, we can thank for their role of protection even as we wait for the day when we can restore our full sparkle. We no longer need to be too concerned about our separate masks. The beautiful thing about our gemlike selves is that we can continuously change and grow throughout our lives.

Suggest a title for this piece. A title that contains a play on words or literary allusion would be nice.

### Assistant - 2023-07-03 17:58:37

Certainly! Considering the recurring gemstone metaphor and the theme of self-discovery, here are a few title suggestions that include a play on words or literary allusion:

1. "Facets of Identity: The Gemstone Within"
2. "Unmasking the Jewel: A Self-Reflection"
3. "Beneath the Masks: Cutting the Gem of Selfhood"
4. "Reflections of a Gem: The Multifaceted Self"
5. "Brilliant Masquerade: A Study of the Bejeweled Self"
6. "The Diamond Unmasked: Refractions of Self"
7. "The Polished Persona: Cutting Through Masks to Self-Discovery"
8. "Shaping the Gem: The Grinding Pursuit of Self-Identity"
