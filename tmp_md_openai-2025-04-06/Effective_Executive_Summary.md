##### Notes
Unlike most Forewards, this one can be used as an excellent reminder of the key principles Drucker shares in this book. It presents and gives a basic discussion of 10 principles that the author learned from this work. These do not map directly to chapters, but they do map directly to the biggest concepts shared in the book.

- First, manage thyself
    - Your people will not be able to perform at a higher level unless you can perform at a higher level. Therefore, raising your level of performance is key to executive effectiveness. The rest of the principles and the book as a whole are about how to do this.
- Do what you're made for
    - We're all incompetent at most things. So we should look for what we can do uncommonly well and focus on building our role so we can do more of that. We should do the same for others: look at what they're uniquely qualified to do and enable them to do it. This doesn't mean ignoring deficiencies but it does mean not trying to match yourself and others to roles where those deficiencies are critical to success.
- Work how you work best (and let others do the same)
    - Everyone works differently and each person needs to be responsible for enabling themselves to do their best work in their own way.
- Count your time, and make it count.
    - Track what you do is your time and set targets for a key metric to focus on. Do only one thing at a time. Only participate in meetings that matter. 
- Prepare better meetings.
    - Meetings can be a huge waste of time so take the time to ensure the ones you have are valuable. Two common ingredients to good meetings are preparation with a clear purpose in mind and disciplined follow up.
- Don't make a hundred decisions when one will do.
    - Good decisions require room for argument and debate, time for reflection, and energy to execute them. Time should be spent on making a small number of big decisions that can apply to make specific situations. Making many small decisions is a waste of time.
- Find your one big distinctive impact. 
    - Instead of focusing on many small things, focus on one absolutely fundamental contribution that would not happen without you and focus on that until it has happened.
- Stop what you would not start.
    - Without discipline, todo lists are ever-expanding. Focus on priorities and clear away the clutter. Pivot from the past to the future. Always ask, "What's next?" And embody this by not persisting in doing anything you would not start today.
- Run lean. 
    - Lean organizations are more effective than large ones. Focus on making organizations effective by getting great people, giving them really big things to do, enlarging their responsibilities, and then letting them work. Don't design work for the people, instead be willing to give people the big important jobs that they are well positioned to do.
- Be useful.
    - Don't worry about how to be successful. Focus on how to be useful. This will add up to impact. 

#### Preface

##### Notes
The most important element to being effective is to manage yourself. Effectiveness consists of a number of practices that can be learned. 

Executives do not do most of the work of an organization themselves. Effectiveness is what they are being paid for. Effectiveness turns activity into performance. Executive effectiveness is a necessary prerequisite to organizational effectiveness and, in this modern era, organizational effectiveness is critical to societal effectiveness. 

#### Introduction: What Makes an Effective Executive?
- Get the Knowledge You Need
- Write an Action Plan
- Act
    - Take responsibility for decisions
    - Take responsibility for communicating
    - Focus on opportunities
    - Make meetings productive
- Think and Say "We"
##### Notes
Effective executives follow eight practices in common:
- Practices which give them the knowledge they need
    - They asked, "What needs to be done?"
        - This will contain more than one urgent task, but to be most effective, executives should concentrate on one task if at all possible. At *most* two. Other tasks, no matter how important, should be postponed. Ideally, these should be the tasks the executive can do well, with other tasks delegated to others who can do them better. 
    - They asked, "What is right for the enterprise?"
        - They focus on the enterprise as a whole, not any individual stakeholder (e.g., owners, stock price, employees, executives). This is because decisions that are not right for the enterprise will ultimately not be right for any of the stakeholders. 
- Practices which convert knowledge into effective action
    - They developed action plans.
        - Knowledge must be translated into deeds to be useful. Doing this effectively requires creating a plan which includes thinking about desired results, probable restraints, future revisions, check-in points, and implications for how to spend their time. 
        - Some questions to ask: 
            - What contributions should the enterprise expect from me over the next 18 months to two yars?
            - What results will I commit to? 
            - With what deadlines? 
            - Is the course of action ethical?
            - Is it acceptable within the organization? 
            - Is it legal?
            - Is it compatible with the mission, values, and policies of the organization? 
        - This plan should not be seen as a straitjacket but rather as a statement of intentions. 
        - Then, to be effective, this plan must become the basis for the executive's time management. 
    - They took responsibility for decisions. 
        - A decision has not been made until people know:
            - the name of the person accountable for carrying it out;
            - the deadline;
            - the names of the people who will be affected by the decision and therefore have to know about, unTderstand, and approve itâ€”or at least not be strongly opposed to it; 
            - the names of the people who have to be informed of the decision, even if they are directly affected by it.
        - Decisions should also be reviewed periodically on an agreed upon schedule. Poor decisions should be corrected. Checking the results of decisions is also a powerful self-development tool since it forces people to understand the quality of their decisions.
        - This includes checking in on staffing decisions. Underperforming individuals should not be tolerated in important jobs. They need to be removed. 
        - Decision making is a crucial skill at every level, and decision making should be taught to everyone. 
    - They took responsibility for communicating. 
        - To be effective, both action plans an an executive's information needs must be understood. They should share plans and get feedback. They also need to let others know what information they need to get their job done. 
    - They were focused on opportunities rather than problems.
        - Problems must be taken care of. However, problem solving does not product results. It prevents damage. Opportunities are what create results. Change, both inside and outside the corporation, is something that an executive can look at for opportunity.
        - Effective executives also start by thinking about opportunities first rather than putting problems front and center. They put their best people on their opportunities, not on their problems. 
- Practices which ensure the whole organization felt responsible and accountable
    - They ran productive meetings.
        - Meetings should be work sessions. Different meetings require different methods for being effective, but each meeting should have a clear purpose and be focused on that purpose. 
        - Meetings should finish as soon as their specified purpose is complete. Sum-up and adjourn.
        - Good follow-up is as important as the meeting itself. For example, the owner of a meeting should follow up the meeting with a short memo to the attendees:
            - summarizes the discussion and its conclusions
            - spells out any work assignments from the meeting, with owners and deadlines specified 
        - "Effective executives know that any given meeting is either productive or a total waste of time."
    - They thought and said "we" rather than "I."
        - Effective executives have authority but only because they have the trust of the organization. They meed to be focused on the needs and opportunities of the organization before their own needs and opportunities. 
- Bonus practice: Listen first, speak last. 

#### 1: Effectiveness Can Be Learned
- Why We Need Effective Executives
- Who Is an Executive?
- Executive Realities
- The Promise of Effectiveness
- But Can Effectiveness Be Learned?

##### Notes
An executive is expected to be effective, that is, to get the right things done. This is different than intelligence. People can be brilliant and ineffectual. Brilliance must be turned into effectiveness through systematic work. Similarly for imagination and knowledge. These are resources, but effectiveness is required to turn them into results.

We need effectiveness because knowledge work depends on taking knowledge and putting it to work, so to say. Key to this is working on the right things. And since only the knowledge worker knows what is in their head, only they can push themselves toward effectiveness. Furthermore, the ability to be effective ties directly to the knowledge worker's sense of motivation. 

In the context of this book, ever knowledge worker is an executive if they are responsible for a contribution that materially affects an organization's capacity to obtain results. This is because such people must make decisions, not just carry out orders. And because these people have specialized knowledge, they are placed to be better at making the right decision than anyone else. Anyone whose work is defined by results is an executive.

Multiple factors push executives towards ineffectiveness. 
- Executives tend to have their time owned by others in the organization. 
- They are often expected to continue focusing on operational concerns. However, this means that the flow of events can dominate the executive's time, keeping them from working on what is truly important. 
- Executives are only effective if what they do is translated into impact through others. To be effective, they have to reach those others.
- Executives see the world through the distorting lens of their organization. But results do not occur within an organization. Results only occur outside of an organization. What happens in an organization is effort and cost to get that result. But it is this inside view which is most visible and most demanding.

Effectiveness is a key area of investment for increasing executive performance. Fortunately, effectiveness can be learned. Effectiveness is a habit made of practices, and practices can be learned. 

The habits of an effective executive:
1. "Effective executives know where their time goes. They work systematically at managing the little of their time that can be brought under their control."
2. "Effective executives focus on outward contribution. They gear their efforts to results rather than to work. They start out with the question, 'What results are expected of me?' rather than with the work to be done, let alone with its techniques and tools."
3. "Effective executives build on strengthsâ€”their own strengths, the strengths of their superiors, colleagues, and subordinates; and on the strengths in the situation, that is, on what they can do. They do not build on weakness. They do not start out with the things they cannot do."
4. "Effective executives concentrate on the few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results. They force themselves to set priorities and stay with their priority decisions. They know that they have no choice but to do first things firstâ€”and second things not at all. The alternative is to get nothing done."
5. "Effective executives, finally, make effective decisions. They know that this is, above all, a matter of a systemâ€”of the right steps in the right sequence. They know that an effective executive decision is always a judgment based on 'dissenting opinions' rather than on 'consensus on the facts.' And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions. What is needed are few, but fundamental decisions. What is needed is the right strategy rather than razzle-dazzle tactics."

#### 2: Know Thy Time
- The Time Demands on the Executive
- Time-Diagnosis
- Pruning the Time-Wasters
- Consolidating "Discretionary Time"

##### Notes
Planning one's work sounds like a good idea, but it rarely work. Effective executives do not start with their tasks. They start with their time and figuring out where it actually goes. This allows them to cut back unproductive demands on their time. They then can consolidate the time so that they can work on meaningful tasks. This is a never-ending tasks since as soon as some time is clawed back, other things will vie to fill it. 

Process:
- Record time
- Manage time
- Consolidate time

This process is required because executives have constant demands on their time, much of which is wasted and much of which is beyond their control. Yet effective work requires chunks of time that allow the executive to focus. 

Using time effectively also requires understanding how people use the output of their work and how it's used by others, colleagues, leaders, and reports. They must ask all knowledge workers:
- What should we at the head of this organization know about your work?
- What do you want to tell me regarding this organization?
- Where do you see opportunities we do not exploit? 
- Where do you see dangers to which we are still blind?
- All together, what do you want to know from me about the organization?

The larger an organization is, the more time an executive will need to spend interacting with others, and the more time they will have to spend making people decisions. People decisions have long ranging consequences, so they should be made slowly and multiple times before committing them. 

Executives need to record their *actual* time use. This record should be made in real time, not off of memory. Then given this record, the executive can 
- Start with identifying and eliminating that which does not need to be done. 
- Then look for activities which could be done as well or better by someone else. 
- Next look for ways their time is wasted or in which they cause time to be wasted. Learn to ask systematically and without being afraid of the truth, "What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effectiveness?"
    - A particular time waster is meetings, so making meetings open to people but making it clear that they are truly optional and why they should come can make it so they don't feel like they're being kept out of the room but can contribute their time. "Please come if you think that you need the information or want to take part in the discussion. But you will in any event receive right away a full summary of the discussion and of any decisions reached, together with a request for your comments."

Pruning time wasters can be challenging. Here are some techniques:
 - First, identify time wasters which follow from lack of system or foresight. Look for the recurrent crises and put in place a routine which prevents it from being a crisis. 
     - "Similarly a well-managed organization is a 'dull' organization."
 - Second, look for areas where overstaffing leads to wasted time, where too much time is spend on interactions instead of working. A symptom of this is if senior people and people managers spend more than a small amount of their time human relations issues. 
     - "In a lean organization people have room to move without colliding with one another and can do their work without having to explain it all the time."
 - Malorganization wastes time and can often be identified by an excess of meetings. Meetings are concessions to a deficient organization. To reduce meetings, look for work that is spread over too many jobs or components and which should be consolidated. 
- Finally, malfunction in information wastes time. Information that is not making it to the right place or which is in the wrong form can create work in the form of executives acting as manual conduits for passing information. 

Once time wasters are identified, executives should work to consolidate their remaining discretionary time. It won't be a lot, no matter how ruthlessly the executive prioritizes. An important aspect of this is not letting things cut into that discretionary time. Acknowledging that crises can generally wait until the designated focus time is done allows an executive to use their focus time fully. 


#### 3: What Can I Contribute?
- The Executive's Own Commitment
- How to Make the Specialist Effective
- The Right Human Relations
- The Effective Meeting

##### Notes
The effective executive focuses on how their work contributes outward toward goals. "What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance and the results of the institution I serve?" This is in contrast to a downward and inward focus effort. 

This requires focusing on the performance of the whole and turning attention to the outside (since this is the only place where results exist). This does not mean his own skills or specialty don't matter, but rather that they matter through the lens of fulfilling the organization's goals. 

Contribution tends to focus in three ares:
- direct results - these come first
- building values and their reaffirmation - without this, an organization is degenerate into disorganization, confusion, and paralysis
- building and developing people - this allows an organization to perpetuate itself

"An executive's focus on contribution by itself is a powerful force in developing people. People adjust to the level of the demands made on them. The executive who sets his sights on contribution raises the sights and standards of everyone with whom he works."

Knowledge works are often specialists. However, specialists must have their specialty connected to the broader goals if they are to contribute effectively. Specialists should constantly be asking others "What contribution from me do you require to make *your* contribution to the organization? When do you need this, how do you need this, and in what form?"

Contribution also strengthens human relations. A focus on contribution strengthens communication, teamwork, self-development, and development of others. Some key questions:
- Communication: What are the contributions for which this organization and I, your superior, should hold you accountable? What should we expect of you? What is the best utilization of your knowledge and your ability? 
- Teamwork: Who has to use your output for it to become effective? 
- Self-development: What is the most important contribution you can make to the organization? What self-development do you need to do that? What knowledge and skill do you need to acquire to make that contribution? What strengths do you have that you can put to work? What standards do you set for yourself?
- Developing others: When we demand much of others, it stimulates them to grow.

Contribution also comes from effective meetings, reports, and presentations. They make sure the purpose of the meeting is clear before it is called, and they focus the meeting on that purpose:
- Why are we having this meeting? Do we want a decision, do we want to inform, or do we want to make clear to ourselves what we should be doing? 

#### 4: Making Strength Productive
- Staffing from Strength
- How Do I Manage My Boss?
- Making Yourself Effective

##### Notes
You cannot build on weaknesses, only on strengths. And achieving results requires using all the available strengths. The goal of the organization should be to build on strengths and make weaknesses irrelevant. Staffing to avoid weaknesses will produce, at best, mediocrity. 

Staffing decisions should be made based on strengths and ability to get results. "What do they contribute?" and "What can they do uncommonly well?" not "How do they get along with me?" or "What can they not do?" No one is great at everything, so staffing from strength often requires looking for excellence in one major area. A well rounded person may well turn out to be mediocre. 

Although we should not structure organizations around individuals, we should structure organizations to take advantage of strengths and make weaknesses irrelevant. This means not putting people into roles where a critical requirement of the role is something they are weak in or where their strengths will not benefit them. "\[T\]he immediate task of the executive is not to place a man; it is to fill a job." But this does not mean finding the person who is the least misfit for the job, that leads to mediocrity. Nor should the job be shaped to the individual. Instead, look at the task to be accomplished and find the person who can do that task very well. Four rules for doing this:
1. Know that jobs are designed and can be redesigned. Be on the lookout for "impossible" jobs, jobs which have defeated multiple people in succession. These jobs should be redesigned. 
2. Make jobs demanding and big. Make them challenging so they can bring out the strengths people have. 
3. Since we must start with what individuals can do rather than what the job requires but since we do not want to shape jobs to individuals, effective executives must think about people long before the decision on how to fill a job has been made. We must appraise them independent of the role we are considering them for so we know what roles can utilize their strengths. Focus on performance, not potential.
    - "All one can measure is performance. And all one should measure is performance. This is another reason for making jobs big and challenging. It is also a reason for thinking through the contribution a man should make to the results and the performance of his organization. For one can measure the performance of a man only against specific performance expectations.
    - Ask:
        - What have they done well?
        - What, therefore, are they likely to be able to do well?
        - What do they have to learn or acquire to be able to get the full benefit from their strengths? 
        - If I had a child, would I be willing to have them work under this person? Why or why not? 
            - (This last one gets at a sense of character that the other questions do not)
4. Know that to get strength, you have to put up with weaknesses. Ask:
    - Do they have strength in one major area?
    - Is this strength relevant to the task? 
    - If they achieve excellence in this one area, will it make a significant difference?
    - If the answer to all of these is yes, then consider the person for the role. 

Remember that effective executives focus on opportunities. "Staffing the opportunities instead of the problems not only creates the most effective organization, it also creates enthusiasm and dedication."

Ruthlessly remove anyone, especially any manager, who consistently fails to perform with high distinction. Letting these people stay on corrupts others and is unfair to the whole organization. Do this even if you do not have a replacement. But also acknowledge, as General Marshall did, "that to relieve a man from command was less a judgment on the man than on the commander who had appointed him." The same person may be well fit for another role. 

Some other advice from General Marshall:
- Only care about weaknesses when they limit the full development of a person's strength. 
- Always appoint the best-qualified person, no matter how badly they are needed where they are. 
- Every personnel decision is a gamble, but basing decisions on what someone can do makes it at least a rational gamble. 

Focusing on strength is good for organizations and for individuals: "A superior owes it to his organization to make the strength of every one of his subordinates as productive as it can be. But even more does he owe it to the human beings over whom he exercises authority to help them get the most out of whatever strength they may have. Organization must serve the individual to achieve through his strenghts and regardless of his limitations and weaknesses."

Effective executives make fully productive the strengths of their manager. This helps them to be most effective by allowing them to focus their contributions such that it will be put to use by their manager. This is done most effectively by starting out with what is right and then presenting it in a form which is accessible to the manager.  The effective executive accepts both the strengths and limitations of their manager. They don't worry too much about what the manager cannot do and instead focus on what they can do well. They do not try to reform their boss. 

Effective executives also focus on their own strengths in their work. They focus on doing what they can do well and in so doing make their limitations irrelevant. There are almost always meaningful contributions that can be made from the perspective of what an individual is able to do. On the flip-side, individuals will not be effective trying to be something they are not. 

The performance of a group is set by its leaders, so the effective executive raises the performance of a group by putting outstanding people into leadership positions. They staff from strength. 

#### 5: First Things First
- Sloughing Off Yesterday
- Priorities and Posteriorities

##### Notes
"Effective executives do first things first and they do one things at a time."

It's hard to find time for the work that really contributes, which means that an effective executive needs to focus on what is most important. Upward contribution, the kind that has real impact takes time. Effective executives make the mental switch from staying busy to achieving results. This requires saying "no." With the power of focus, the effective executive can do large, impactful things, the sort of work that most people would feel proud of doing one of in their tenure at a company. 

Concentration is required because we are rarely able to do more than one thing well at a time. It's also the case that doing one thing at a time is the best way to get it done quickly because one can concentrate time, effort, and resources on the tasks. This focus allows the effective executive to exert *less* effort than the people who are busy but don't have as much impact. 

To achieve this focus, first one must slough off yesterday. Each day ask, whether or not they would do something today if it were not already started. If the answer is no, drop it. The executive's job is to commit resources to the future, not to the past. This includes not over investing in yesterday's successes, which tend to linger and suck up resources beyond their productive life. This is especially true when they are seen as symbols of past success for individuals or organizations. We should think of all programs as having a limited lifetime where they have to continually renew their value to the organization. 

> "The executive who wants to be effective and who wants his organization to be effective polices all programs, all activities, all tasks. He always asks: 'Is this still worth doing?' And if it isn't, he gets rid of it so as to be able to concentrate on the few tasks that, if done with excellence, will really make a difference in the results of his own job and in the performance of his organization."

One piece of advice given in the chapter is that one should staff new efforts with veterans and put new folks on efforts that are established and running smoothly.

It's especially important to slough off old activities before starting new ones so that the organization can stay lean. Organizations often focus on the value of encouraging creativity, but in practice, they are much more limited by everyone spending their effort on the priorities and tasks of yesterday. Regularly reevaluating everything and getting rid of anything that's not proving value today is an effective way to stimulate creativity in practice. 

Even when old work is sloughed off proactively, there are still always more opportunities than there is time to do it. Opportunities become available only to the extent to which capable people can take charge of them and it becomes part of the normal order of things. These decisions cannot be made based on the pressures the business is encountering because the pressures always favor the concerns of yesterday. 

Instead of executives focusing on what to do, they should focus on deciding what to postpone â€” which generally becomes deciding what not to do â€” and making it so the company can stick to that decision. This is unpleasant. It means denying someone's top priority. It's much easier to decide to do a little bit of everything. That is more likely to make everyone happier â€” but also means that nothing ever gets done.

> Courage rather than analysis dictates the truly important rules for identifying priorities:
> - Pick the future as against the past;
> - Focus on opportunity rather than on problem;
> - Choose your own directionâ€”rather than climb on the bandwagon; and
> - Aim high, aim for something that will make a difference, rather than for something that is "safe" and easy to do.

These priorities and posteriorities (things you decide not to do) will change in the face of reality. And accomplishing the top priorities generally changes the priorities and posteriorities that are worth focusing on . 

> The effective executive does not, in other words, truly commit himself beyond the *one* task he concentrates on right now. Then he reviews the situation and picks the next one task that now comes first. 


#### 6: The Elements of Decision-Making
- Two Case Studies in Decision-Making
- The Elements of the Decisions Process

##### Notes
Decision making is one of the most important jobs of the executive, but this does not mean that effective executives make a lot of decisions. In fact, effective executives concentrate on the most important decisions.

> They try to think through what is strategic and generic, rather than "solve problems." They try to make the few important decisions on the highest level of conceptual understanding. They try to find constants in a situation. They are, therefore, not overly impressed by speed in decision-making. Rather they consider virtuosity in manipulating a great many variables a symptom of sloppy thinking. They want to know what the decision is all about and what the underlying realities are which it has to satisfy. They want impact rather than technique, they want to be sound rather than clever.

Elements of the decision process (quoted, but not all from the same place)
> 1. The clear realization that the problem was generic and could only be solved through a decision which established a rule, a principle;
>       The first question the effective decision-maker asks is: "Is this a generic situation or an exception?" "Is this something that underlies a great many occurrences? Or is the occurrence a unique event that needs to be dealt with as such?" The generic always has to be answered through a rule, a principle. The exceptional can only be handled as such and as it comes.
> 2. The definition of the specifications which the answer to the problem had to satisfy, that is, of the "boundary conditions";
>     The second major element in the decision process is clear specifications as to what the decision has to accomplish. What are the objectives the decision has to reach? What are the minimum goals it has to attain? What are the conditions it has to satisfy? In science, these are known as "boundary conditions." A decision, to be effective, needs to satisfy the boundary conditions. It needs to be adequate to its purpose. ... "What is the minimum needed to resolve this problem?" is the form in which the boundary conditions are usually probed. 
> 3. The thinking through what is "right," that is, the solution which will fully satisfy the specifications *before* attention is given to the compromises, adaptations, and concessions needed to make the decision acceptable;
>     One has to start out with what is right rather than what is acceptable (let alone who is right) precisely because one always has to compromise in the end. But if one does not know what is right to satisfy the specifications and boundary conditions, one cannot distinguish between the right compromise and the wrong compromiseâ€”and will end up by making the wrong compromise. 
> 4. The building into the decision of the action to carry it out;
>     Converting the decision into action is the fourth major element in the decision process. While thinking through the boundary conditions is the most difficult step in decision-making, converting the decision into effective action is usually the most time-consuming one. Yet a decision will not become effective unless the action commitment have built into the decision from the start.
>     
>      In fact, no decision has been made unless carrying it out in specific steps has become someone's work assignment and responsibility. Until then, there are only good intentions. 
> 5. The "feedback" which tests the validity and effectiveness of the decision against the actual course of events.
>     Finally, a feedback has to be built into the decision to provide a continuous testing, against actual events, of the expectations that underlie the decision. 
>     ...
>     To go and look for oneself is also the best, if not the only, way to test whether the assumptions on which a decision had been made are still valid or whether they are becoming obsolete and need to be thought through again. And one always has to expect the assumptions to become obsolete sooner or later. Reality never stands still for very long. 

It's common to treat a generic situation as a series of unique events. This leads one to fail to discover and respond to the underlying generic principle and find a lasting adaptation. Another common mistake is treating new events as instances of old problems, applying the old rules without thinking. It's also common to define the fundamental problem incorrectly or incompletely. 

To get past all of these limitations, the effective decision maker should always initial assume that problems are generic and that the particular instance is the symptom, not the true problem. And when a problem truly shows up as unique, it should be treated as potentially the first manifestation of a new generic problem. 

Another challenge with effective problem solving is partial solutions, solutions which do not satisfy the "boundary conditions" of the problem. Setting the boundary conditions is always a risk-taking judgment. A solution that does not solve the problem it aims to solve will only cause problems. A clear understanding of the boundary conditions also is necessary as a tool for deciding when a decision should be abandoned. 

Boundary conditions also help identify the dangerous class of decisionsâ€”the ones that *might* work if *nothing* goes wrong. These sorts of miraculous decisions are problematic because they are not reliable. Rejecting these decisions often requires making the hard choice of which compromise to choose instead of hoping that the miraculous will occur... and then failing to achieve anything. 

The difference between the right compromise and the wrong compromise is knowing the difference between half a loaf and half a baby (in the sense of the judgment of Solomon).

Questions involved in converting a decision into action:
- Who has to know of this decision?
- What action has to be taken?
- Who is to take it? 
- What does the action have to be so that the people who have to do it can do it?

This last question is critical. If the people tasked with carrying out a decision do not have the capability to carry it out, the decision will fail. Beyond individual skill, this requires looking at how people are measured, their standards for accomplishment, and their incentives. These may also have to change to focus people on the new action and away from the old way of doing things. 

It's critical to get feedback about whether decisions are working and if the assumptions behind them were and still are sound. However, that feedback cannot come second hand, at least, it cannot all come second hand. Instead, the effective executive must supplement the reports they get with direct exposure to reality. 

#### 7: Effective Decisions
- Decision-Making and the Computer

##### Notes
Decisions rarely have a right and a wrong. They are a judgment call, often with no provably correct path. Decisions do not start with facts, for gathering facts requires knowing what facts are relevant. Instead, decisions start with opinions, which are most fruitfully thought of as hypotheses to be tested. The clash and conflict of these divergent opinions are what forms the understanding from which a decision can be made (often without achieving consensus).

Opinion is often treated as an inferior place to start, but when the people having the opinions are experts in their domain, their opinions are highly valuable. However, even the most well founded decision is just a hypothesis and must be tested against observable experience. 

> The effective executive encourages opinions. But he insists that the people who voice them also think through what it is that the "experiment"â€”that is, the testing of the opinion against realityâ€”would have to show. The effective executive, therefore, asks: "What do we have to know to test the validity of this hypothesis?" "What would the facts have to be to make this opinion tenable?" And he makes it a habitâ€”in himself and in the people with whom he worksâ€”to think through and spell out what needs to be looked at, studied, and tested. He insists that people who voice an opinion also take responsibility for defining what factual findings can be expected should be looked for.

One key aspect of this is deciding which criteria are relevant to the decision. Even in cases where the appropriate criteria are numeric, identifying these criteria is not a mathematical exercise. It is a risk-taking judgment. Which of the viable alternatives will the executive choose? How do they each define what is truly at stake? 

Consensus is often held up as the gold standard of decision making, but effective executives know that the best decisions are made when they have taken into account multiple alternatives. And finding the truly valuable alternatives requires creating dissension and disagreement. One should not make a decision at all unless there is disagreement. If there's not disagreement, the group should take more time to develop disagreement. Disagreement stimulates the imagination and helps the group discover better solutions. (This disagreement also provides something to fall back to should the original decision prove unsound.)

> The only way to break out of the prison of special pleading and preconceived notions is to make sure of argued, documented, thought-through disagreements. 

> The effective decision-maker does not start out with the assumption that one proposed course of action is right and that all others must be wrong. Nor does he start out with the assumption, "I am right and he is wrong." He starts out with the commitment to find out why people disagree.

On top of all this, the effective decision-maker must always ask "Is a decision really necessary?" They should consider the alternative of doing nothing. Interventions always bring some risk, and that risk should only be taken when there's clear value to be had, such as an opportunity that will be lost or a situation that is degenerate if nothing is done. 

However, many situationsâ€”more than we give credit forâ€”will take care of themselves if nothing is done. 

> If the answer to the question "What will happen if we do nothing?" is "It will take care of itself," one does not interfere. Nor does one interfere if the condition, while annoying, is of no importance and unlikely to make any difference anyhow. 

Most decisions are between these extremes. The problem will not take care of itself, but it's merely an opportunity for improvement, not real innovation or the solving of an existential threat. Some criteria in those situations (quoted):
- Act if on balance the benefits greatly outweigh cost and risk; and
- Act or do not act; but do not "hedge" or compromise.

Decisions are most often lost at the point at which they are made. Once the boundary conditions have been set, specifications thought through, alternatives explored, risks and gains weighed, making the decision itself can be relatively easy. But it is at this point that all of the bad aspects of the decision are undeniably visible: it will take work, it won't be popular. At this point, it can be tempting to delay the decision, to gather more data. The effective decision-maker must resist this temptation. 

> When confronted with the demand for "another study" the effective executive asks: "Is there any reason to believe that additional study will produce anything new? And is there reason to believe that the new is likely to be relevant?" And if the answer is "no"â€”as it usually isâ€”the effective executive does not permit another study. He does not waste the time of good people to cover up his own indecision. 
> 
> But at the same time he will not rush into a decision unless he is sure he understands it. Like any reasonably experienced adult, he has learned to pay attention to what Socrates called his "daemon": the inner voice, somewhere in the bowels, that whispers, "Take care." Just because something is difficult, disagreeable, or frightening is no reason for not doing it if it is right. But one holds backâ€”if only for a momentâ€”if one finds oneself uneasy, perturbed, bothered without quite knowing why. 

Note that computers, no matter how powerful, cannot make decisions for us. This is because, as previously noted, decisions are ultimately judgment calls. 
#### Conclusion: Effectiveness Must Be Learned

##### Notes
Effectiveness is a self-discipline, but one that can be learned. The conclusion summarizes the key practices of effectiveness once again. 

It also emphasizes that every knowledge worker needs to have the skills of an effective executive to build what is even rarer: the effective organization. Organizations as a whole need to work systematically to increase their effectiveness: feeding opportunities, making strength productive, concentrating and setting priorities. 

The skills of effectiveness are also critical for satisfying the needs of both organizations for performance and individuals for achievement and fulfillment. Effective individuals are able to use their strengths to have real and meaningful impact. This is incredibly motivating.

Peter Drucker's "The Effective Executive" is a seminal guide that lays out the key practices and habits that executives need to cultivate to be effective in their roles. The central theme of the book is that effectiveness is not an innate talent but a set of practices that can be learned and systematically applied. Drucker emphasizes that being effective is about getting the right things done, which requires a focus on results, time management, and leveraging strengths.

The foreword to the 50th Anniversary Edition distills ten key lessons from Drucker's work, emphasizing self-management, leveraging one's unique strengths, optimizing time, preparing well for meetings, making fewer but more impactful decisions, focusing on a single significant contribution, eliminating unnecessary tasks, running a lean organization, and being useful rather than merely successful. These principles serve as a practical guide to improving personal and organizational performance.

The preface reiterates the importance of self-management, stressing that executives' effectiveness is crucial for organizational performance and, by extension, societal effectiveness. Drucker argues that effectiveness can be learned through disciplined practices and habits.

In the introduction, Drucker outlines eight practices that effective executives share: asking what needs to be done, focusing on what is right for the enterprise, developing action plans, taking responsibility for decisions and communication, focusing on opportunities rather than problems, running productive meetings, and thinking in terms of "we" rather than "I." These practices are foundational for converting knowledge into effective action and ensuring that the entire organization feels responsible and accountable.

Chapter one, "Effectiveness Can Be Learned," defines an executive as anyone whose work materially affects the organization's capacity to achieve results. Drucker highlights that effectiveness is about converting intelligence, imagination, and knowledge into results through systematic work. He outlines five habits of effectiveness: knowing where time goes, focusing on outward contributions, building on strengths, concentrating on key areas for superior performance, and making effective decisions.

In chapter two, "Know Thy Time," Drucker emphasizes the importance of time management. Effective executives start by understanding where their time goes, managing it, and consolidating their discretionary time to focus on meaningful tasks. This involves recording actual time use, eliminating unnecessary activities, delegating tasks, and preventing time wasters.

Chapter three, "What Can I Contribute?" focuses on the outward results of an executive's work. Drucker advises executives to concentrate on direct results, building values, and developing people. This outward focus strengthens communication, teamwork, and self-development. Effective executives also ensure that their meetings, reports, and presentations are purposeful and contribute to the organization's goals.

In chapter four, "Making Strength Productive," Drucker asserts that organizations should be built on strengths, not weaknesses. Staffing decisions should be based on individuals' strengths and their ability to achieve results. He emphasizes that effective executives focus on the strengths of their subordinates, colleagues, and superiors to make weaknesses irrelevant. They also manage their bosses by accepting their strengths and limitations and focus on their own strengths in their work.

Chapter five, "First Things First," highlights the importance of focusing on priorities. Effective executives do one thing at a time, concentrating their efforts on what is most important. They regularly reassess their activities, sloughing off tasks that no longer contribute to the organization's goals. This process involves making tough decisions about what not to do and having the courage to stick to those decisions.

In chapter six, "The Elements of Decision-Making," Drucker outlines a structured approach to decision-making. Effective executives identify whether a problem is generic or unique, define the boundary conditions, think through the right solution before considering compromises, build the decision into action, and establish feedback mechanisms to test the decision against actual events. He warns against the dangers of treating unique situations as generic and making decisions without clear specifications.

Chapter seven, "Effective Decisions," further elaborates on decision-making, emphasizing that decisions are judgments based on opinions rather than facts. Effective decision-makers encourage dissent and diverse opinions to explore alternatives and identify the best course of action. They also consider the option of doing nothing when appropriate and resist the temptation to delay decisions unnecessarily.

The conclusion reinforces that effectiveness is a self-discipline that can be learned and systematically applied. Drucker stresses that every knowledge worker needs to develop these skills to create effective organizations. The practices of effectiveness not only enhance organizational performance but also fulfill individuals' needs for achievement and impact. Effective individuals are motivated and capable of making meaningful contributions, which is essential for both personal and organizational success.

Peter Drucker's _The Effective Executive_ lays out the key practices and habits that executives need to cultivate to be effective in their roles. Effectiveness is not an innate talent. It is a set of practices that can be learned and systematically applied. Drucker emphasizes that being effective is about getting the right things done, which requires a focus on results, time management, and leveraging strengths.

Although there are ways this book is focused at folks with some amount of organizational leadership, as Drucker emphasizes, the principles he lays out are valuable for any knowledge worker whose value comes from how they choose to use their time and apply their strengths. Also, just to get this point out of the way: yes, this book comes from an era where formal leadership was almost exclusively a masculine activity and the constant use of "he" is grating. It's valuable despite that. 

The book is well structured (and at times a bit redundant). One could probably get the key points from reading the forward (to the 50th anniversary edition), the preface, and the conclusion. Yet the text as a whole is a fairly easy read which elaborates and illustrates these key principles. 

What I liked about this book is that it is written from a perspective that isn't as common in modern business books. Drucker understands individual and organizational psychology but also accepts as a given that the goal of a business is to get business results. Thus, unlike many modern business books where it seems as if individual fulfillment and business success are put in conflict with each other, Drucker deeply understands that the goal of the business organizationâ€”a fairly modern societal inventionâ€”needs to be to align these two things. Thus, Drucker's advice, while sometimes dated, overall comes across as highly practical. 

With that, into the summary!

Drucker highlights that effectiveness is about converting intelligence, imagination, and knowledge into results through systematic work. He outlines five habits of effectiveness: knowing where time goes, focusing on outward contributions, building on strengths, concentrating on key areas for superior performance, and making effective decisions. The rest of the book goes into these practices in more detail. 

Effective executives start by understanding where their time goes, managing it, and consolidating their discretionary time to focus on meaningful tasks. This involves recording actual time use, eliminating unnecessary activities, delegating tasks, and preventing time wasters.

Executives should have an outward focus. They should concentrate on direct results, building values, and developing people. They should avoid time wasters, especially ineffective meetings. All meetings, reports, and presentations should have a clear purpose that contributes to the organization's goals. 

Organizations should be built on harnessing individuals' strengths, not avoiding weaknesses. Positions should be designed around the job to be done, not around individuals. However, when choosing which people should fill those positions, don't focus on the person who best meets the criteria overall. Focus on the people who bring the most relevant strengths to bear and whose weaknesses are irrelevant to the goal to be met. 

Effective executives do one thing at a time, concentrating their efforts on what is most important. They regularly reassess their activities, sloughing off tasks that no longer contribute to the organization's goals. This process involves making tough decisions about what not to do and having the courage to stick to those decisions.

Effective executives focus on making a small number of important decisions. They focus on making those decisions as general rules, not specific instances. Ultimately, decisions are judgments based on opinions rather than facts. This is why they spend most of their effort upfront: defining the boundary conditions, thinking through the right solution before considering compromises, ensuring the decision defines what is needed to turn it into action, and establishing feedback mechanisms to test the decision against actual events.  They encourage dissent and diverse opinions to explore alternatives and identify the best course of action. They also consider the option of doing nothing when appropriate and resist the temptation to delay decisions unnecessarily.

Drucker stresses that every knowledge worker needs to develop these skills to create effective organizations. The practices of effectiveness not only enhance organizational performance but also fulfill individuals' needs for achievement and impact. Effective individuals are motivated and capable of making meaningful contributions, which is essential for both personal and organizational success.
