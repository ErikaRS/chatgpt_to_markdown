These questions are designed to elicit responses that reveal the candidate's ability to think strategically, make tough decisions, and balance various aspects of engineering management. They also provide insight into the candidate's communication skills, particularly in how they align their team with the company's vision and handle potential conflicts between business and technical priorities.
