Modify this to better reflect the description below. The description below is for a manager for this team *and* for a relaese team. This role is just for the dev infra team, so just extract those parts. 

Also, update the tone to match this example.

Join Sourcegraph's Infrastructure team and play a crucial role in empowering developers worldwide. We're responsible for building and maintaining the tools and systems that make Sourcegraph's development and release processes smooth, efficient, and reliable. Our team focuses on two key areas:

Developer Infrastructure (Dev Infra): We create and optimize tools and workflows that enhance productivity for Sourcegraph's engineering teams. This includes improving build systems, implementing code quality tools, managing CI/CD pipelines, and streamlining development environments

Release Management: We ensure Sourcegraph's products are deployed reliably and efficiently. This involves improving release tooling and automation, coordinating releases, and continuously improving our deployment processes for both cloud and self-hosted customers.

As the Engineering Manager for the Infrastructure team, you will lead the Dev Infra and Release teams, driving operational excellence, developer productivity, and release management. You will combine technical expertise with a product-focused approach, ensuring your teams deliver scalable solutions as Sourcegraph grows.

Start building a trusting relationship with your direct reports, peers, and stakeholders.
Understand the what, why, and how of the projects that your teams are working on, how those projects contribute to our company goals, as well as current status, risks, and mitigations.

ðŸ“… Within three months, you willâ€¦
Guide the Dev Infra and Release teams forward in reducing the time and toil from code to deployment and improving the observability of the testing/deployment environments and pipelines.

ðŸ“… Within six months, you willâ€¦
Guide the team in finding and implementing improvements in underserved parts of the stack
Reduce the complexity and toil of our releases and deployments
Foster the growth of your reports

ðŸ“… Within one year, you willâ€¦
Scale developer infrastructure, release tooling, and deployment to be more automated and reliable
Build a strong team brand and drive high levels of satisfaction from internal developers, our technical success team, and customer instance administrators

Are there any other technologies we should exxtract? 

### Assistant - 2024-10-08 10:36:56

In addition to Bazel and Buildkite, there may be other relevant technologies worth mentioning, such as:

1. **Terraform** - for infrastructure provisioning and automation.
2. **Kubernetes** - to help manage containerized applications, especially if itâ€™s part of the infrastructure.
3. **Docker** - if containerization is important for local development environments.
4. **Helm** - if managing Kubernetes applications.
5. **Bazel Remote Cache** - to improve build performance.
6. **GitHub Actions** or similar CI/CD tools - if Buildkite isnâ€™t the only CI/CD service being used.
7. **Prometheus/Grafana** - if observability of infrastructure is a focus.
8. **Spinnaker or ArgoCD** - for deployment automation, if applicable.

If these or similar tools are part of your stack, they could be added to help provide a clearer picture of the technology environment for prospective candidates. Let me know if you'd like me to incorporate any of these technologies into the description.

Move the key technical requirements to an "about you" section modeled after this one

About you 
As the ideal candidate, you lead with a product mindset, delivering solutions that drive platform value. Even when there is no formal product owner, you prioritize high-impact work while investing in core infrastructure.


DevEx and SRE expertise: You have a strong background in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Developer Experience (DevEx), with hands-on experience in developer productivity, CI/CD pipelines, and release management for both Cloud services and on-prem customers. You are well-versed in technologies like Bazel and Kubernetes. You know Go and are familiar with TypeScript and the client ecosystem.

System and leadership balance: You maintain a broad view of the system, working with product teams to understand needs while guiding platform development. You effectively balance leadership responsibilities with hands-on work, adapting to immediate needs and long-term goals.

Startup mindset: You adjust your teamsâ€™ strategies to align with the companyâ€™s needs, knowing when to prioritize speed and when to focus on solving deeper, scalable challenges.

Experience with Kubernetes is a requirement. Experience with Bazel, Buildkite, and CI systems  are desirable, along with building and deploying Go-based microservice architectures. Experience with TypeScript clients is a plus, as is familiarity with large mono-repo code bases. 
As the ideal candidate, you will have deep familiarity with the Google SRE operations model, as well as professional experience with the subjects covered in the Google SRE book. Experience with alternative ops models, such as those employed by Amazon, Netflix, and other high-velocity companies with large scale and deep technical stacks, is also desirable.
Some familiarity with Google Cloud Platform is a must. AWS and/or Azure experience are bonuses.

Nice to haves:
Security/secops experience is a bonus but not required.
