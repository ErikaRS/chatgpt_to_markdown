A **flux lens** is a conceptual tool used to view and interpret systems and phenomena in a way that emphasizes change, adaptation, and interconnectedness. The structure and style of a flux lens are characterized by the following features:

1. **Focus on Dynamics**: The lens is designed to highlight the dynamic nature of systems. Instead of seeing entities as static, the flux lens encourages a view that everything is in a state of flux—constantly evolving and interacting with other components.

2. **Systems Thinking**: A flux lens is inherently systemic, meaning it considers the broader context, interconnections, and relationships between different elements within a system. It doesn't isolate parts but instead seeks to understand how these parts interact and influence one another.

3. **Adaptation and Resilience**: The lens often emphasizes the capacity of systems or individuals to adapt to changing circumstances. It looks at how systems maintain resilience in the face of disruptions or transformations.

4. **Multiple Perspectives**: The style of a flux lens is not rigid but is meant to be applied from various angles. It encourages viewing situations from multiple perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding.

5. **Contextual Awareness**: The lens is sensitive to context, recognizing that the meaning and implications of any situation are shaped by the specific environment and conditions in which it occurs.

6. **Reflective and Explorative**: The approach is reflective, asking not just "what is happening?" but also "why is it happening?" and "how could it happen differently?" This explorative nature helps uncover underlying patterns and assumptions.

In summary, a flux lens is a tool for seeing and interpreting the world through the principles of change, interconnectedness, and systemic interaction, with a flexible and context-aware approach.

FLUX typically draws illustrative examples from a diverse range of domains that help underscore its systems-thinking approach. Five key domains often used include:

1. **Technology and Innovation**: Examples from this domain explore how technological advancements disrupt industries, create new opportunities, and necessitate adaptation.

2. **Ecology and Environmental Systems**: FLUX often uses ecological examples to illustrate principles of interconnectedness, adaptation, and the impact of human activity on natural systems.

3. **Economics and Market Dynamics**: The behavior of markets, financial systems, and economic policies provides a rich ground for illustrating flux in action, particularly around issues of resilience and systemic risk.

4. **Organizational Behavior and Management**: Insights from how organizations operate, change, and innovate are commonly used to discuss leadership, culture, and systemic health in a business context.

5. **Cultural and Societal Change**: FLUX often draws on social movements, cultural shifts, and societal trends to demonstrate how ideas, values, and behaviors evolve over time.

These domains offer a broad spectrum of examples that help in understanding and applying the concepts discussed in FLUX.

Give 9 examples of recursive derisking based on this definition

Recursively de-risk
The typical process for building something looks like this:

Understand the problem

Make a plan

Divide and conquer

Deliver to market

Let’s call this the top-down approach. We found that a startup benefits from inverting this process:

Sketch out the idea as quickly as possible

Identify the top risk, blocker, or unknown

Do the cheapest thing to de-risk it

Go to 2


Top-down planning is feed-forward. You won’t find out if your idea actually works until the very end. Recursive de-risking generates feedback quickly and cheaply, allowing you to find out early what works and what doesn’t.

Here are nine examples of **recursive de-risking** based on the provided definition:

1. **Software Development**: A startup plans to build a new app. Instead of developing the entire product, they create a simple prototype with the core functionality. They release it to a small group of users to identify any major issues or missing features before scaling up.

2. **Product Launch**: A company wants to launch a new physical product. They start by 3D printing a basic model to test the design. After gathering feedback, they make adjustments before investing in expensive molds for mass production.

3. **Market Entry**: A business plans to enter a new geographic market. Instead of a full launch, they first conduct a small-scale pilot in one city to test demand and refine their marketing approach based on local customer feedback.

4. **Marketing Campaign**: Before rolling out a nationwide advertising campaign, a company tests its messaging and creatives on a smaller audience using A/B testing. They use the results to refine the campaign before spending on a larger scale.

5. **Feature Development**: A tech company considers adding a new feature to its platform. They first build a minimum viable version of the feature and release it to a subset of users to see if it’s valued and if there are any unforeseen issues.

6. **Sales Strategy**: A startup is considering a new sales strategy. Instead of training the entire team, they first pilot the approach with one salesperson and use the outcomes to refine the strategy before scaling.

7. **Service Offering**: A consulting firm wants to offer a new service. Instead of launching it broadly, they first test it with a single client on a limited scope to understand the potential pitfalls and refine the service offering.

8. **Operational Process**: A company plans to implement a new operational process across all its departments. They start by rolling it out in one department, monitoring its impact and making necessary adjustments before a full-scale implementation.

9. **Customer Acquisition**: A startup is planning a new customer acquisition strategy involving a complex funnel. They first test a simplified version of the funnel with a small budget to identify bottlenecks and optimize the process.

Each of these examples follows the principle of quickly identifying the biggest risk or unknown and addressing it with the least possible investment before moving forward. This recursive approach reduces the chance of large-scale failures and allows for more informed decision-making.

### FLUX Lens: Recursive De-risking

**Overview:**  
Recursive de-risking is a systems thinking approach that flips traditional top-down planning on its head. Instead of moving from problem identification to market delivery in a linear, feed-forward manner, this lens emphasizes a cyclical process where risks are continuously identified and mitigated. By focusing on de-risking the most significant unknowns early and often, this method accelerates learning and reduces the likelihood of costly mistakes down the road.

**Structure and Style:**  
This lens invites us to see any venture—be it a product launch, service offering, or in this case, customer acquisition—not as a linear sequence of steps, but as an ongoing loop of experimentation and feedback. The recursive nature of this process means that each cycle starts with a rough sketch of the idea, followed by a deliberate focus on the most critical risk or uncertainty. By doing the cheapest possible thing to test or mitigate this risk, we generate valuable insights that inform the next iteration. This cycle continues until the risks are sufficiently mitigated, allowing for a more informed and confident full-scale deployment.

**Illustrative Example: Customer Acquisition**  
Imagine a startup that wants to implement a new customer acquisition strategy. Instead of crafting a detailed, long-term plan and executing it in full, the team employs a recursive de-risking approach.

1. **Sketch the Idea**: The startup identifies its target market and hypothesizes that a multi-step funnel involving content marketing, social media ads, and personalized email campaigns will be effective.

2. **Identify the Top Risk**: The biggest uncertainty is whether the target audience will engage with the content enough to enter the funnel.

3. **De-risk Cheaply**: Rather than investing in a full content production cycle and expensive ad campaigns, the startup creates a few pieces of basic content and runs a small-scale ad campaign to test engagement.

4. **Iterate**: Based on the initial results, the team adjusts the content strategy and ad targeting, gradually increasing investment as engagement rates improve.

By following this recursive loop, the startup quickly identifies what works and what doesn’t, refining their approach with minimal expenditure. This not only saves resources but also increases the likelihood of success when the strategy is scaled up.

**Conclusion:**  
Recursive de-risking as a lens encourages us to think in terms of cycles rather than linear steps. By continuously testing and adapting, we create a feedback-rich environment where ideas are validated early and risks are systematically reduced. This approach aligns with FLUX's emphasis on adaptability, resilience, and learning from the system's interactions with its environment.

This lens and approach have been articulated by FLUX's own Gordon Brander, who explores the concept in detail in his discussion on startup strategies . To delve deeper, check out his insights [here](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/raw-intuitions-about-startups).

### FLUX Lens: Recursive De-risking

Imagine a startup testing a new customer acquisition strategy. Instead of launching a full-blown marketing campaign, they start small—running a limited ad campaign with basic content to see if their target audience engages. This iterative approach allows them to quickly identify what works and adjust before scaling up.

**Recursive de-risking** is a powerful concept that flips traditional planning on its head. Rather than following a linear path from problem identification to market delivery, this approach emphasizes continuous cycles of identifying and mitigating risks. By focusing on the most significant unknowns early and testing them in the cheapest way possible, you generate rapid feedback that guides the next steps, reducing the chances of costly mistakes.

From a FLUX systems perspective, recursive de-risking aligns with the idea of adaptive cycles in complex systems. Instead of relying on rigid, feed-forward plans that may not hold up under real-world conditions, this method treats every action as part of an ongoing loop of learning and adaptation. Each iteration provides new information that helps refine the system's behavior, leading to more resilient outcomes. This approach reflects the interconnectedness and dynamic nature of systems, where feedback loops and small adjustments can lead to significant long-term success.

To apply recursive de-risking in your own life, start by identifying a goal or project you’re working on. Sketch out a rough plan, but then immediately focus on the biggest unknown or risk. Take the smallest, cheapest step to test that risk. Gather feedback, learn from it, and use that insight to adjust your approach. Repeat this process until you've built confidence and reduced uncertainty. By embracing this cyclical, adaptive method, you can make more informed decisions and navigate complexity with greater agility.

Suggest edits to this to make it more FLUX-y and weave the themes together more smoothly. Also make things more concise where possible. Highlight the changes in bold.

A startup is testing a new customer acquisition strategy. Instead of launching a full-blown marketing campaign, they start small, running a limited ad campaign with basic content to see if their target audience engages. Some things work, and they try more of the same. Other things don’t work and they pivot. This iterative approach allows them to quickly identify what works and adjust before scaling up.

The agile-adjacent technique of recursive de-risking flips traditional planning on its head. Rather than following a linear path from problem identification to market delivery, this approach emphasizes continuous cycles of identifying and mitigating risks. By focusing on the most significant unknowns early and testing them in the cheapest way possible, you generate rapid feedback that guides the next steps, reducing the chances of costly mistakes down the line.

Recursive de-risking is a type of OODA loop which treats every action as part of an ongoing loop of learning and adaptation. When risks are likely to be existential, focusing the OODA loop on risk directly addresses what is most likely to require a response. Each iteration provides new information that helps refine the system's behavior, leading to more resilient outcomes.  

To apply recursive de-risking, start by identifying a goal or project where there’s a high likelihood of failure. Sketch out a rough plan, and immediately focus on the biggest unknown or risk. Take the smallest, cheapest step to test that risk. Gather feedback, learn from it, and use that insight to adjust your approach. Repeat this process until you've built confidence and reduced uncertainty. This cycle does not guarantee success, but it does allow you to navigate agilely to the factors most likely to stand in your way.

Here’s a more FLUX-y and concise version of your text with changes highlighted:

A startup is testing a new customer acquisition strategy. Instead of launching a full-blown marketing campaign, they start small—running a limited ad campaign with basic content to gauge audience engagement. **As they iterate, what works is scaled, and what doesn’t is swiftly pivoted away from.** This approach allows them to quickly identify effective tactics and adjust before scaling up.

The **FLUX-driven** technique of recursive de-risking flips traditional planning on its head. Rather than following a linear path from problem identification to market delivery, this approach emphasizes continuous cycles of identifying and mitigating risks. By focusing on the most significant unknowns early and testing them in the cheapest way possible, you generate rapid feedback that guides the next steps, reducing the chances of costly mistakes **later on.**

Recursive de-risking is a type of **adaptive cycle** akin to an OODA loop, where every action is part of an ongoing process of learning and adaptation. **When risks could be existential,** focusing the loop on risk directly addresses what is most likely to require a response. Each iteration provides new information that refines the system's behavior, leading to more resilient outcomes.

To apply recursive de-risking, start by identifying a goal or project with a high likelihood of failure. Sketch out a rough plan, and immediately focus on the biggest unknown or risk. **Take the smallest, most cost-effective step** to test that risk. Gather feedback, learn from it, and use that insight to adjust your approach. Repeat this process until you've built confidence and reduced uncertainty. This cycle doesn’t guarantee success but **enables you to adapt agilely to the challenges most likely to stand in your way.**
