Cheap shirts tend to get holes easily due to several factors related to their production and materials:

1. **Low-Quality Fabric**: Cheap shirts are often made from lower-quality fibers that are less durable and more prone to wear and tear. These fabrics might have weaker weaves, leading to easier tearing.

2. **Poor Construction**: The stitching and overall construction of inexpensive shirts may not be as robust as higher-quality garments. Weak seams and poor-quality thread can result in holes developing quickly.

3. **Chemical Treatments**: To keep costs down, manufacturers might use cheaper dyes and chemical treatments, which can weaken the fabric over time, making it more susceptible to damage.

4. **Thin Material**: Cheaper shirts often use thinner material to reduce costs. Thin fabrics wear out faster, especially in areas that experience more friction, such as underarms, elbows, or where a bag strap might rub.

5. **Fast Fashion Practices**: In the fast fashion industry, the focus is often on producing large quantities quickly and cheaply. This can result in compromises on fabric quality and construction standards, leading to garments that don't last as long.

6. **Frequent Washing**: Lower-quality fabrics can deteriorate faster with frequent washing, especially if not washed and dried properly. Harsh detergents and high heat can accelerate this process.

Investing in shirts made from higher-quality materials and with better construction can help mitigate these issues.
