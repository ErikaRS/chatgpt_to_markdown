:loudspeaker: **Team Update: Organizational Change!**

Hey everyone,

We have some important news to share. Starting next week, our Security Team will transition from reporting directly to the CEO to now reporting under the Head of Engineering, Search and Platform.

Additionally, as part of this change, the "Search and Platform" org will be rebranded as "Search and Foundations."

We believe this move aligns better with our strategic goals and will streamline processes for faster, more efficient results. We're excited about these changes and the new opportunities they bring. As always, feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!

Thank you for your continued dedication and hard work! ðŸš€
