A tech company currently has manual quarterly releases and wants to move to monthly releases. Write the outline of a problem scoping doc. The doc should focus on defining the problem, high level descriptions of alternatives, and the tradeoffs between them.

# Problem Scoping Document Outline

## 1. Introduction
   - Brief overview of the current release process.
   - Objectives of moving to monthly releases.
   - Scope and limitations of the document.

## 2. Definition of the Problem
   - Detailed description of the current quarterly release process.
   - Challenges faced with the current process (speed, customer satisfaction, competitive edge, etc.).
   - Opportunities identified with increased release frequency.
   - Impact on stakeholders (development teams, QA, operations, customers, support, etc.).
   - Key performance indicators (KPIs) for the release process.

## 3. Current State Assessment
   - Analysis of the existing release infrastructure and practices.
   - Assessment of current tools and technologies used in the release process.
   - Skills and capabilities of the team regarding release management.
   - Quality and stability of current releases.

## 4. Desired State
   - Vision for the monthly release process.
   - Expected benefits (improved agility, customer satisfaction, etc.).
   - Potential risks and mitigation strategies.
   - Resource requirements (human, technological, financial).

## 5. High-Level Description of Alternatives
   - **A. Incremental Shift Approach:**
     - Description: Gradually decreasing the release cycle duration.
     - Implementation plan outline.
   - **B. Big Bang Approach:**
     - Description: Switching directly to monthly releases.
     - Implementation plan outline.
   - **C. Phased Rollout:**
     - Description: Implementing monthly releases in phases across different products/services.
     - Implementation plan outline.
   - **D. Feature Toggle Approach:**
     - Description: Implementing continuous deployment with feature toggles to control release scope.
     - Implementation plan outline.

## 6. Tradeoff Analysis
   - **A. Incremental Shift Approach:**
     - Pros: Lower risk, allows gradual adaptation, feedback-oriented.
     - Cons: Slower transition, may prolong some existing issues.
   - **B. Big Bang Approach:**
     - Pros: Immediate benefits, clear change in process, potentially invigorating to team morale.
     - Cons: Higher risk, requires significant upfront investment and training.
   - **C. Phased Rollout:**
     - Pros: Risk containment, focused resource allocation, learning from early phases can inform later ones.
     - Cons: Inconsistency across product lines, complex coordination.
   - **D. Feature Toggle Approach:**
     - Pros: High flexibility, allows for gradual feature release and testing in production.
     - Cons: Requires sophisticated feature management and monitoring systems, can be complex to manage.

## 7. Preliminary Recommendations
   - Suggest the most suitable approach based on the tradeoff analysis.
   - Short-term and long-term recommendations.

## 8. Success Criteria and Metrics
   - Define clear metrics to measure the success of the transition to monthly releases.
   - Establish baseline metrics for current quarterly releases.

## 9. Risks and Mitigation Strategies
   - Identify potential risks associated with transitioning to monthly releases.
   - Outline strategies to mitigate each identified risk.

## 10. Conclusion
   - Recap of the identified problem, proposed alternatives, and their tradeoffs.
   - Call to action for stakeholders to review and provide feedback.

## 11. Appendices
   - A. Detailed process maps of current and proposed release processes.
   - B. Technology and tool assessment reports.
   - C. Staffing and training requirements.
   - D. Budgetary considerations and financial impact analysis.
   - E. Glossary of terms and acronyms used in the document.

## 12. Approval and Sign-off
   - Sign-off section for key stakeholders to approve moving forward with detailed planning and implementation.

This document should serve as the starting point for detailed planning and discussion on transitioning from quarterly to monthly releases, and it should be updated with feedback from stakeholders throughout the process.
