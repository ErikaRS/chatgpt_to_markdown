Code these survey responses. The first section is the prompt that I sent everyone. The second section "Responses" is the collected responses. Each response is separated by a tag of what department it is from, a single line that says either "Eng" "Design" or "Product"

=Prompt=
I sent everyone in EPD (well, design is still pending on Rob’s feedback) this:
(Non-urgent, optional)
What is one thing that would make you feel more enthusiastic recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work?

Context:
The trends in our Lattice anonymous pulse surveys show that EPD is not feeling very enthusiastic about Sourcegraph these days. In particular, our sentiment is trending quite negative on the question:
How likely are you to recommend Sourcegraph as a place to work?

I want us to be a place where people want to work, so I am asking everyone in EPD what we could do better. It doesn't matter (and I don't need to know) what you would answer on the sentiment survey question. Rather, whatever your starting sentiment, I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work. 

I can't say what I can do with the responses until I know the content, but I will read every response and put together a plan. 

Answering is completely optional. Or, if you'd like, you can give more than one thing. I'll take that too. 

Thank you so much!

I feel pretty content but I am still riding new-guy high

I do sense frustration on shifting priorities and being asked to do lots of competing things without enough staffing from a few people.

Like even from $NAME on the $WORK I get the biggest sense of frustration I have seen from him. Not a concern, he is fine. But just in terms of feeling jerked around and expected to make something work without due diligence
Design
(meeting notes) 
Had a retro fresh off the Chris changes. Design before Chris felt like engineering always did what they wanted and design was on back heels. So folks on team wanted to be doing more. When Chris joined, there were tight units, designers were involved in planning and moving things forward. Team is okay with the process updates with Chris gone, but feels like there is a disconnect between what we say we’ll do and what we’ll really be doing. 

We have a new product planning process, we’ve gone through the roadmap. We also have Quinn driving individual efforts and just going forward on individual projects. Team understands this and is fine with it, but that way of working conflicts with how other product teams in the industry works. 

It’s hard to sell this working model to a designer. Can’t easily answer questions on process and planning and how design can influence. 

E.g., design didn’t have a seat at the table in product roadmap planning. Designers feel like they can’t get their proposals through. 

Sentiment was less “this sucks” but more somber and feeling like they want to have reality match what we say. 

Diving into mismatch between what we say and do: we say we want a quality product with quality design. But if design doesn’t have a voice in planning, then the issues they want to advocate for don’t get prioritized and we’ll have low quality design. 

User testing is treated as not important, but then those same things become an issue. We could have gotten ahead of things by listening to issues. Can be doing more to evaluate things with customers to learn and iterate. 

Thing that would help: If Rob could tell designers that we have a top 6 list of priorities from design and they, like GTM, could submit that to Product. And if they could get an item or 2 off that list into priorities, that would help quite a bit. 

Another one: Around the quality of the end result. Spoke with someone who works with customers, and heard a lot of frustration around the quality of the software we’re producing (e.g., JetBrains GA). Frustration is at an all time high. Feels like the SDLC proposal to have QA and user testing built into the schedule would be a good fix. Wants to see some of that before we release it to customers. Especially when we have that feedback in advance (e.g., from design). 

Release process: we released monthly, had quality problems, reduced to quarterly releases, but we didn’t do anything process-wise to fix things. Now we’re shipping monthly, but we still don’t QA in a realistic way. It’s a cultural expectation that engineer dogfooding is sufficient QA. 

When we do user testing before release, we do catch issues and fix them. That’s the biggest thing design could make a difference on.

I honestly feel incredibly enthusiastic about recommending Sourcegraph and do every chance I get. I think the thing that would give me the biggest hesitation/pause are as follows - happy to dig deeper into any of these:
lack of clear ownership of product/general product issues
clear pathways for advancement beyond IC5.
Not because people need promotions but direction - we need some Rafals in more classic Principal Engineer roles
Not just because we need their influence, but because we need that model for IC4s and 5s to give them a direction to move
and also to show how to convert good ideas into influence
More service ownership culture in product teams
Matt's doing a good job infusing this and it's not totally absent
But it makes me anxious about referring folks into Infra, when we tell them we don't have clear pathways for escalations to feature owners
General economic/industry anxiety
The market is scary & Sourcegraph is small
There are some existing post-RIF scars here, and I think people still wear it on their sleeves - that can be offputting to candidates

Overall my sentiment about SG is very bullish/positive. I can see how the lack of alignment between Cody & the rest of the company might be really disenfranchising though - it was certainly my biggest source of fear/concern before landing on Pro and is part of my motivation to move to Cody. I think the company's problems are very solvable, but when they are far away/tucked in a corner, it's much scarier.


Product
Here's my take:
we've made almost 0 strides in leveraging context as our differentiator, even though we've been talking about it for >1 year
collaborating with teammates has been very hard. with major timezone differences and the chaos that's slack, it's hard to make sense of what's going on and feel a sense of "working together". I'm hopeful that Linear will help with the former, but things like constant org changes, priority changes, changes in strategy (cough cough embeddings) makes the doing the job a slog and hard for us to execute effectively
our revenue growth is slow, macro aside
comp is very low, our equity when compared against public comps, after exercise costs, is effectively $0
i know we discuss IPO as the aspiration, but I believe if we were to look at things a bit more soberly, I would wager that people see themselves as working jobs and they want to get paid. So if we're not even considering an acquisition that are positive for the shareholder + employee, then that's pretty demotivating. Additionally, I personally find the comparisons to dethroning msft silly if not straight haughty, and i think it does more to demotivate than to inspire confidence

E: Do any of these stick out to you as more important than the others or are they all roughly equal?

in the short term, comp helps. long term we just need to start winning. codeium, github, tabnine, etc are eating our lunch


Eng
No way to grow by learning from others:
EM function was (historically) very weak at Sourcegraph, and while we now have some solid EMs, they still don’t have enough influence to help their reports grow / there’s too few of them
Senior ICs are either siloed, or spend their time juggling multiple fires, and mentoring / being a force multiplier is not valued
The way we build teams means that most people are alone in their timezone, and need to rely on themselves (or connections they can build without anyone helping them)

No way to have impact generally associated with start-ups:
we don’t follow any grand plan, and even if we choose a direction, we either fail to put sufficient resources behind it, or immediately start uncoordinated pivots
ownership (and promotions) are assigned based on proximity to founders, so a newcomer has a very low chance of making major impact
most of our major engineering problems are ignored (and stay unsolved), so it’s unlikely that someone can deliver a major breakthrough

Equity compensation - we tell candidates that “you join a startup due to equity upside”, but our grants are based on a round raised 3 years ago, during an unprecedented valuation bubble, while we were growing 300% YoY.
We now struggle to grow 10% YoY and our FMV is ~11% of Round D, so it would take log_base_1.1 of 9 == 23 years to grow back to our Round D valuation, and:
we don’t have 23 years of runway
even if we got back to Round D valuation, an IC3 grant would end up being worth ~1 year salary (before taxes)
Our location-independent comp made up for this in the past, but for new hires, an IC3 would be much better off doubling down on LeetCode and getting an offer from Big tech (and that’s in a most optimistic scenario for Sourcegraph)

E: Would you rank any of these as more important than the others or are they all roughly equal?

It really depends on what a new hire is looking for (growth / impact / equity upside),  my ex-FAANG colleagues were generally looking for #2 / #3, but we can’t / won’t fix #3, and fixing #1 will help with #2, so, order is roughly #1 -> #2 -> #3?
Design
Hey Erica! Happy to share I’d say…
More gender diversity in hiring (like, aggressively)
All of leadership demonstrating a unified focus on things like inclusion, open/transparent communication, and healthy work practices (not just certain folks at certain times)
Design investment. Workload across product and marketing has grown while our design team has shrunk significantly. I was even told there would be an additional brand designer when I was hired. I’ve since been told that will likely never happen, while the marketing team keeps growing (and their design support needs with it). I’d be very hesitant to recommend a fellow designer join a team that is chronically understaffed. Additionally, design is not represented at the exec level of a company who’s trying to create deeply engaging, high quality, well-crafted experiences. Both of these factors give the impression design is not valued as highly as it ought to be.

E: Do you have a relative ranking between them or are they all roughly equal for you?

I’d say they’re roughly equal
Eng
Reason I won't recommend to friends to work here anymore is zonal pay.
Eng
Two things that would make me more likely to recommend Sourcegraph:
Location-independent pay. Much of my professional network outside Sourcegraph is in Michigan, which is a 20% haircut off of what used to be competitive salaries.
Embracing OSS. I am enthusiastic about working in public, as are many of my peers. The decision to move the monorepo private is a big blow.

E: What about you personally? Beyond the things you mentioned, are there things we can do to improve your happiness in your role

Feels like a waste of an opportunity to ask for change, but I’m actually feeling quite good in my role right now.
So instead, I’ve been really appreciating:
The stability in my team’s work, particularly around the svelte rewrite and the space we’ve had to actually make it lovable
The effort Peter is making to find (and create) opportunities for growth
The telegraphing of incoming change, and the space we’ve been given to prepare for it


Eng
I don't have a solution, but I can explain on why. Kindly keep my response anonymous.
Why I would not recommend others to work at Sourcegraph?
Negative sentiment built up from the past (pre Erika era ) where a group of teammates do not care. I believe passionate people thrive the most when they're working with others who are also passionate. Things are less fun when there's a gap, and energy will wear off over time.
On-call/support rotation was supposed to be a given (as documented in handbook), but some teams did not enforce it. Some engineers I talked to didn't know on-call was a thing. This also contributed to the discrepancy to on-call expectation between Cloud and non-Cloud part of the organization. We advertise Cloud for 24/7 coverage, but we do not have the same commitment across all teams.
Difficult to get help from other engineering teammates. Cloud cares a lot about our customer, and we do what we can to keep things running and them happy. However, I am not thrilled to be the person nudging people for help when it is supposed to be their job. I believe our engineering team can learn from CE teammates about customer obsession.
Comp is no longer attractive to non-US talents due to the zone-based pay policy. In Canada, it's not competitive for senior+ positions; Lack of discretionary budget at EM disposal to provide incentives to retain talents.
Doubt on whether Cody will make us worthy of the 2.7B valuation, and other factors such as ARR growth.
Some of the points above came up a lot when chatting with teammates in private, so I believe I am not the only one feeling this way.
Why I may consider recommending others to join right now?
Things are improving where remaining teammates care a lot more than before, but I still observe from time to time, specific example would be ignoring hard questions despite the subject matter falls under their direct ownership (it's not always worth starting a fight, and we usually just workaround it to unblock customers sooner rather than later).
Better support coverage and on-call practice is on our agenda (per our discussion yesterday), but it will still take time to materialize.
Cody org appears to be more organized now, but again, it will take time to materialize.
Sourcegraph has a cool product to work with and room for growth for the right people.
I am not saying "I am quiting cuz there's so many negative things". In the short run, I am happy with my current position, and working toward making our team to be more sustainable. In the medium/long run, it remains a .


Eng
I think I was probably on the happier end of the survey, probably the very high end, and thus perhaps not as representative.

For me it would be better work-life balance; it’s always hard to disconnect here. I literally took this week off as PTO so that I could focus on work without distractions.

I helped set the potentially unrealistic performance expectations we have on Eng, so obviously it’s a glass house. But the high pressure here, often caused by top-down deadlines, is why I personally feel uncomfortable disconnecting.
Eng
From what I’ve been hearing, enthusiasm has waned largely because of our trend away from features that set us apart from the norm and toward behaviors that mimic those of other companies. It probably started with our move away from OSS last year (do I have my timeline right?). These are changes that favor the corporation, usually at the expense of the employee, like changing the time for exercising options after leaving the company.

I have recently put all of this together in my head, so it’s still kind of raw.  I’m not hearing outright complaints from anyone, but just an undercurrent of comments. I probably couldn’t even point out specifics, except recently Camden PM’d me “this is disappointing” linking to the announcement of making repos private.

Probably the disappointment is there because these teammates viewed these features as reflecting our core values, and now that they’re changing, they’re questioning what our core values are now.
Eng
 What is one thing that would make you feel more enthusiastic recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work?

I never felt negatively in any instance, Instead of recommending Sourcegraph at first place - I proudly talk about the accomplishment SG has did (public info such as milestones, blogs, tweets, conferences) and then try recommending to join SG.

Standing to the above point, I referred couple of my friends (ashok for cody team, venkat for ml) but looks like at they aren't great match to the role while comparing existing candidates. I'll definitely keep recommending SG to my friends/great colleagues 

Thank you

hi Erika, I will try to be very short and precise to save your time on reading 
in summary:
1. Sourcegraph has very interesting technology stack and good salary, so we are able to hire very good and ambitious people.
2. The ‘problem’ with great engineers and ambitious people is that they want to create things that make impact which last - and here is the issue with Sourcegraph: I guess nobody can promise that the work I (or anyone) is doing now is needed in 2-3 months time, b/c the company strategy is changing so quickly. This led to frustration and also many re-organisations of the company, which caused few laid-offs.
Solution options I could imagine:
Principal/architect group - I worked for many companies, and those having small group of ‘solution architects’ were really successful, have stable crew and were able to keep founders visions compatible with engineering work i.e. even if strategy is changing, they were able to somehow adapt already implemented projects so people felt they work matters.  Good example might be Cloud Team in Sourcegraph - apart from Dax (+4y in one company, which is quite long  ), nobody has left company on its own (some people were fired b/c of company strategy changes though) b/c we had vision (thanks to @Rafal Gajdulewicz) what are building in the long run and we could see the impact
More clear ownership - i.e. Source owns gitserver, so they take responsibility for it (incl. on-call), but when company decides to do something with it, their word matter the most - this way they feel the build and own something, vs being just a simple ‘contractor’
Hope that my loose thoughts can help a bit - happy to answer any questions or clarify things if needed 


Eng
Oh wow! That surprises me. I actually have almost nothing but good things to say about working here.

My only mark against sourcegraph is that they laid off someone I recommended for a job a month into them working here. (This was not a for cause firing). But it was before your time, and honestly I feel like it was the exception for sourcegraph, not the rule.

Speaking to my role as a junior, I feel extremely well-supported and feel that my contributions are noted by my superiors. The compensation is great too. Sorry all I have to say are good things!


Eng
I guess if I had to pick one thing, it would be more transparency into where the company has been and is going. Like, what's the PLAN? "It's a big opportunity", sure, how about some structure and detail and then a strategy to exploit that. I should be able to see the financial statements over years in a PDF, not slides. I miss epigraphs/epitaphs and the Meta practice of badge posts. We could be a bit more self-critical and people leaving is a great time to get open appraisals of that.

The trends in our Lattice anonymous pulse surveys show that EPD is not feeling very enthusiastic about Sourcegraph these days.
That's unfortunate to hear. But not entirely surprising. Both from what I've heard from other IC engineers, and seen myself, the company has some cultural and execution challenges. Also, FWIW, I may-or-may-not be one of the individuals whose anonymous feedback hasn't been especially positive lately.

... so I am asking everyone in EPD what we could do better. ...
I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work.

I reason I would be hesitant about recommending Sourcegraph to a close friend is because I can only assume they would be just as { frustrated, disappointed, dismayed } at the same things that I am. To put it bluntly, I'm not sure Sourcegraph is a good fit for me in the first place. Let alone such a great place that I would actively try to convince my friends and former colleagues to join.

It pains me to admit that. But I say it because I take great pride in being honest and direct. These are values I care deeply about. Similar values I hold dear are producing high-quality work and shipping software. Which is a great segue into what would make me feel more enthusiastic about Sourcegraph as a place to work.

I would feel more enthusiastic if Sourcegraph shared my values about software engineering, and shipping high-quality software, quickly.

While I do see vestiges of "well constructed" or "intentionally designed" things in the codebase, overall, I just don't get the sense that "high-quality software engineering" is something Sourcegraph cares about. Or is even capable of doing. We talk about it. But I've never actually seen it. I would describe the engineering culture here as a bunch of open-source hackers that just happen to get paid. I see individuals adding one-of features or hacks for high-priority customers, without any regard for the overall product. Or the system we are now maintaining. Or with an eye towards how we can make the overall codebase easier to understand or more reliable.

If you need concrete examples of (IMO) unacceptably low engineering standards, or completely careless design decisions, I can provide you with all the receipts you need.

And this tension -- how I view my own "seriousness" when it comes to creating software vs. the reality at Sourcegraph -- is really draining.  And as you are already aware, this tension is leading conflicts between me and other members of the team. Who may not feel as strongly about "engineering rigor" as I do. Or who believe -- perhaps correctly so! -- that Sourcegraph doesn't require that high of a bar with regard to standards.

For me, it's hard to be enthusiastic about building a product in this environment. But let me come at this from another direction:

I currently experience the text-book definition of burnout. And I have no doubt that my (loving and supportive) management would encourage me to take some time off. But the work isn't the problem. I'm not burnt out because I spent a good chunk of my weekend writing unit tests. In fact, I like the work. I'm proud of the work. I sincerely value making an improvement to the codebase and product.

The sense of burnout stems from my values not being shared by the organization.

If I didn't write those tests, and just went ahead with a large refactoring project... I doubt anybody would push back. In fact, I know there wouldn't be any push-back. Because who is going to be championing the need for that sort of thing? Certainly not whomever reviewed the initial PR that added all the code in the first place.

Pivoting back to the "enthusiasm about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work". If I think about my potential future at the company, is this it? Spending the next several years of my career carefully refactoring a technical debt and undoing haphazardly made product decisions? All while struggling to avoid alienating my colleagues with my unreasonably high expectations for code quality? Or for reliability? I don't want to be that crochet asshole that's always complaining about things.

It's A-OK if Sourcegraph doesn't aim to treat code quality or service reliability as seriously as, say, Google. But for me personally, if Sourcegraph did value these things as highly as Google, it would make me more enthused about working here. And on a product that aims to help developers do a thing that I am very passionate about.

So my ramblings about discontent and ennui aside, here are some concrete suggestions for what IMHO would make it easier to recommend Sourcegraph as a place to work for other engineers:
Focus. Not talk about focus. Not say we "will start to focus". But actually set out to build a product, and not a growing collection of hacks that approximate a product. (Exercise: Go look at the Linear projects in-flight, and then tell me what the "themes" the engineering team should be thinking about. Or what the top-level selling points will be for the next release.) Also it, seems odd that both the CEO and CTO both have their own one-off pet projects. It's none of my business and all... but if we are thinking about building X, then we should design and build X. Not hack together a tech demo, and then throw it over to someone like Chris Smith to build a "product" out of it.
Follow industry practices. If something is a big enough problem that we create an #inc-XXX channel, then it's surprising that there is no follow-up. Why don't we write, socialize, and review post-mortems? And then follow-up on the action items. And have accountability to ensure that we don't make the same mistakes again. I am perpetually shocked this isn't already the case. (Similarly, I have "notes" on how how Sourcegraph has approached operations and oncall for things like Cody Gateway.)
Live a product-focused world view. I don't know when Search jobs or Teams shipped. But at what point do their "Beta" and "Experimental" labels just communicate a sense of abandonment and neglect to our customers? I have heard repeatedly, from many people all across the company that historically we have perpetually fallen into the trap of "chasing some shiny new thing"... so perhaps this is just what we collectively accept is part of our DNA at Sourcegraph. But personally, that's not something I'm enthusiastic about.

Anyways, hopefully that is clear enough to be helpful in some way. If there is anything I can do to help you in your endeavor please let me know. Cheers!

I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work.
I've given this a good think and its really hard to answer. I've typed up and then deleted messages quite a lot  , my quarterly check in is coming up soon ad maybe I can discuss further then.
The two main things:
A reduction in the culture of heroics and more focus on health of teams
More confidence that engineering and customer feedback is making it to leadership and product. (sometimes sg feels very catch 22, I've personally seen some serious grapevine comms)
I honestly think a lot of what has hurt morale is just a long tail of beloved coworkers quitting or being laid off. I know the layoffs were awhile ago, but they had a major impact. Happy to chat more in our forthcoming quarterly check in.


Eng
Thanks for reaching out Erika !!

So far, I have felt very positive about working at Sourcegraph and I genuinely enjoy collaborating with such amazing colleagues. The clear direction from our leadership on the projects I am working on has been incredibly helpful. The direct involvement of Beyang and Rishabh in these projects has provided a clear scope, regular feedback on progress, and insights into potential improvements.

Additionally, our daily standups are very beneficial for discussing progress and updates. These meetings are really helpful for me to communicate any blockers I face, receiving early feedback on ongoing projects, and staying connected with the team. Another benefit of having daily standups I feel is that they reduce the burden of updating every detail on Slack (which takes a bit more time), and it is often faster to simply discuss with the group and take notes of high-level points.

I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work.

I thought a lot about this specifically about this exact question and couldn't come up with a great answer. But lets explore this a bit

Firstly, would I recommend Sourcegraph as a place to work to a colleague?

Actually I would, I recommended one of my previous sub managers to a role at sourcegraph recently(They are from Boston).

 Would I recommend it to every colleague?

I would absolutely recommend but I would offer some caveats
Timings : Firstly in certain teams if you are a manager/High level IC(which I am not) it would be much much nicer to be in North America than not.  That's not necessarily a sourcegraph thing but a team thing. I personally work quite late in Europe time fairly regularly not necessarily because I have to but because its more convenient and I personally don't mind because I get a lot of meaning out of working at sourcegraph(These are my personal feelings and can't be extrapolated to everyone though). If I didn't work later in european time things might be harder in communication coz if you look at a lot of low latency communications I had in the last few weeks they were all early in North America time and later in europe time. Note: once again I really don't mind this much coz I am young and single so my life priorities are slightly different right now. I would probably be living a different life in a few years though.  Also, I can think of some people who had issues with the late times in europe mainly because of family commitments etc(which are very understandable concerns).
Tooling : Another aspect that some people might find mildly confusing is the frequent changes in our tooling. This is something where I think the product managers might have more insight, but I’ve noticed that we sometimes switch tools without clear reasoning. For example, we’ve used GitHub, GitHub Issues, and GitHub’s project board in the past, and now we use Linear. Personally, I find Linear harder to use because I’m not sure how it all integrates. Additionally, we use various apps, the handbook, and Notion, which adds to the confusion. This tooling inconsistency makes me question if it actually boosts our productivity.

Those are the main points I can think of. Despite these issues, I want to emphasize that I really enjoy working at Sourcegraph. It’s the most meaningful job I’ve had in my career, and I would still absolutely recommend to everyone as a great place to work. While these issues don’t personally bother me (mainly because I am an IC who gets to work on really cool problems day to day) but I can understand why they might be a concern for others as I have seen other people mention these things to me.

Hey Erika, thanks for reaching out. For what it's worth I recommended a candidate recently.
I've got two things that make me less likely to recommend SG to a friend/ex-colleague
Recommending that someone come work with me knowing they'll only make 60% of what I make because of location-based pay makes me very uncomfortable
I feel like communication and marketing have recently become more AI-hype focused than I feel comfortable with. I'd be much more comfortable being loud about Sourcegraph if that wouldn't mean putting "All programmers will be replaced by AI in the next 5 years" content on my mostly language/compiler focused followers/mutuals (they know better).


Eng
The biggest downside right now is probably the region-based salaries. Living in Zone 3, I find it a bit harder to recommend SG to local folks I know since the 40% drop from Zone 1 can be a bit much. I'd also feel a bit guilty because I've been grandfathered in and they'd be making significantly less for the same work.

I know a lot has been said about this so I won't prattle on too much - it's a difficult problem and I don't really have any good, non-obvious suggestions.

E: If you have an opinion on this, I'd love your thought on if it's location based pay in general that is problematic or if it's the steepness of our drop. (Or some other aspect!)

It's probably a bit of both to be honest 🤷Location-based pay seems a bit unequitable in general... And our drops are indeed steep, to the point where we aren't the clear choice for the best folks we are trying to hire in zones 3 & 4 IMO. 
Eng
Good question, and I am happy that you're top of that.
As for me, I am pretty happy and excited to work here and continuously recommend my friends to work here! I am eager to have the JD of both Dax and Eric replacements to broadcast to them all!
I am also very happy that we found our way to communicate and we are working great together (well, at least from my POV :)).
Ah... I did not have a chance yet to thank you for backing me up on discussions with other teams. THANK YOU! 
-----
As you seek data points, I will list things I heard that could be of interest to you...
I often hear complaints from the people I talk with about some things in the company that I could imagine factor into the question above. I will list a few that I heard of (and keep in mind that I can't say for certain that these would necessary mean those folks were necessarily unhappy.)
The thing we discussed earlier about the rumor that if you're not working on something shiny, you get bad reviews
If you are not the DRI of something you don't get credit
Quinn's "dive bombs" into threads (actual phrasing I heard) that wreaks havoc in the priorities and force moving to a "show better light to the boss" which may not be the best course of action for the issue at hand
In the case of the Release team, their extreme difficulty in working with TS
These are not Infra-specific, but I am combating them as if they were to help.
In the Infra, I have been working on all of them:
Communicating #1 and #2 from our chat. I may do some more broadcasts to help curb that rumor.
For #3, you and I worked with Quinn to help coordinate better with the teams.
And for #4 we are actively working with Aimee and Andrew to improve.

I am generally enthusiastic about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work. If asked about the qualities that contribute to success at Sourcegraph, besides strong technical skills, I would highlight the ability to handle ambiguity, self-motivation to overcome obstacles, proactivity, strong communication skills, and openness to changing teams and adapting to shifting priorities.
Eng
I consistently answer “yes” to this question - no need to hide anything here. I like the place, the people, and the work. However if I would recommend a friend to work here, I have a very high bar for “strong yes”, since anything negative when I recommend the place will also affect the personal relationship.
What would it take for me to say strong yes:
Recommending a place to work means I think they are a really good fit for some role. We’ve had a lot of team instability and last minute reassignments of new hires in the past year or so, so even if I would think person X is a great fit for “git expert on source”, I would not be certain they would actually join for that in the end, or they might be reassigned to something else within 6 months, and then the job might not necessarily match their skill set or interests anymore.
I would love a longer-term roadmap than just 3-6 months so that I can tell people more about our vision and a rough idea of “what they’d do in 1y from now” - are we gonna build self-driving cars, context sources, or excavators kind of level precision.
Low impact, but I noticed that I thought about that before: People will be comparing total compensation as part of the offer, and I don’t have a great handle on “how much is stock worth” at the moment, so I wouldn’t know if I can tell them “yes Sourcegraph could pay comparably to company X that offered you Y dollars”. It’s been a few years since we had our last investment round, the market changed two times since then and we have about zero idea about the value.


Eng
I think the 2 major factors which play a role here, based on my own assessment and the feedback I collected from the departures in the last 6 months are:
constant change.
not feeling appreciated.


Eng
In the pursuit of AI-associated $$$ and growth, I think we are:
Doing a disservice to our existing customers who have brought us to this strage by having many important functions on life support
Losing differentiation
Harming our brand (see point 1 for enterprise features) and for PLG, we say "Unlimited Autocompletions", but I keep hearing reports of people running into rate limiting, we've had to walk back statements related to "Graph context" in messaging.
Not consistently engineering things in a way that's built to last (e.g. OpenCtx -- look at the amount of feature code vs tests -- calling some APIs is of course easy, the challenge is going to be enterprise customizations and maintenance, which makes having solid testing infrastructure vital).
When I joined 2.5 years back, I had a very clear picture of how Sourcegraph was different from every other dev tool company, and how it could lean into that more. At this point, it feels like we're becoming more like a mish-mash of other companies in the space without a clear identity.

I know that sounds quite negative, but I'm here because I think there's still a bunch of smart, well-intentioned people here who care about improving the customer & user experience as a whole.
Eng
tl;dr: Sourcegraph is a nice place to work, but I wouldn't recommend it to my peers in Germany because the recent salary change has made it uncompetitive.
Eng
The two main themes that stand out for me are:
There’s been quite a lot of changes in the past 8 months or so. I totally understand that this is now new in the startup scene but the frequency of these changes kind of feel like we aren’t stable and anything can happen at anytime.
The second is because of these frequent changes, a lot of folks are getting burned out and i think that is the reason for the negative reviews on Lattice.
Apologies for the late reply, it’s been a packed week for me.
Eng
it’s been awhile since i do the pulse surveys but i’d still recommend Sourcegraph to people that I want to work with, i’m just not sure about things that’d make me feel more enthusiastic about it :lolsob: I will think about this over the weekend and let you know next week!
Eng
I think I’d press the ⅗ or  ⅘ button, depending on mood.
To get me to 5 / 5, I think:
Better management – many 1-1s canceled, didn’t have the min. 25 min/week, today’s is my 3rd 1-1 canceled without notice in a row.
Less ambiguity (the bad type)

Verbal follow-up notes:
Management
Heard people complain about management in general. Lots of manager changes. Many managers don't provide a lot of people management to people.
Really important to have a manager who he can discuss things with.
Has had 7-8 managers so far in a bit over 2 years.
In many of these cases, didn't get a monthly 1:1 regularly.
When there aren't regular 1:1s you get unhealthy corridor talk
Ambiguity
Still finds it difficult to explain to people his role before. Now he's clearly in an IC role. But for the last half year it was hard to tell. Had one person on his team, another person he was kind of dotted line managing. Didn't really understand the role expectations.
E: Other?
Would like a greater sense of job security. Layoffs were nearly a year ago, but still feels threatened about that. If fired tomorrow, would feel a lot less surprised than he would have a year ago.
Expectation for a healthy environment is that he could trust the company that if he under performed against expectations he would get very clear feedback and have time to improve. Unexpected termination happened to many people and it generated insecurity.
Feels very sad about the monorepo going private. Understands the reasoning and it makes sense. But also it was a huge plus to him that his work was out in the public. Not a great feeling.
Would originally have been a 6/5. The decrease is largely due to the culture changes. But is still very enthusiastic about the people and the quality of our talent. Also very excited about the space where we are. AI assistant space is something he's really enthusiastic about.
Eng
EPD AMA is today, so I might have missed the wagon, but still dropping some thoughts just in case:

If I can quote only one thing, it would be just more stability. I wish I could be sure of not just what tomorrow is going to be about, but at least up to the next month too.

It feels we're constantly in conflict in between making sure we ship a stable/reliable products to our customers and at the same time, we're in pioneering mode with Cody. It feels we're constantly on edge trying to reconcile the two. We want to be better at planning and less unpredictable in how we work, but then an event will whirlwind into that and it feels like we're back to square one.

Sometimes I feel we get asked about our opinions, without fully understanding what will happen out of it [1] and it contributes to that sentiment. To be perfectly honest, it's always at the back of my head when SQS asks something.

Just a little example: as much as I like and strongly agree with the decision to switch to a monorepo and making it private, which for the latter is something that I mentioned a few times as problematic, I realized while writing this, why are we sharing that decision so hastily? But for example on that one I didn't think for a second that this would lead to "let's make it private right now".

Can't we slow things down for a bit, work out a plan and announce that we're putting on the roadmap to make sg/sg private? The decisions for everything going in sg/sg says that it's effective immediately. I suppose it's mostly about new initiatives, not about "hey folks, merge your code back in sg right now!". The "what a friday from @joe (go/joe-ooo)" is saying out loud what I suspect a lot of us think.

Perhaps I'm just reading this example wrong though. Please tell me if that's the case, it would help me a ton. I also believe I should stand up more for this type of things, but often it feels like I'm not answering asap, the decision will happen before I could even get back to the thread.

[1]: Not saying I'm against fast decisions at all, I'm a strong supporter of the "boss is the boss, period", we need leaders to call the shots, otherwise it derives into zombie mode and nothing happens and we slowly die (edit: as a company, let's not make it too dramatic ) 
Eng
Hey Erika. I think the main thing for me that makes me not want to recommend Sourcegraph as a place of work currently is due to the zone based pay. I feel our current designation (Zone 3) for South Africa is unwarrented but I haven’t had the time to gather proof why
Eng (meeting notes)

eNPS
Was trying to type a thing there
Feeling of not being able to focus on anything makes it hard to feel like he would recommend someone to work here. Makes it feel like this isn't for just anyone.
E: What would increase the sense the stability enough to be worth recommending?
Not sure if it's a team specific thing.
When they were still split between having IAM and Repo team, it felt like he could take a lot more ownership of IAM related things, like code host connections. Ownership is the right term. You see an issue and can just fix it.
Now, attention is super divided between just about everything. Every time you come back to something, even something you worked on last month, it feels like new code.
Also, just doesn't know anyone he would recommend a job to. A lot of people he knows wouldn't be a good fit for Sourcegraph.
E: Have seen examples like this too.
It's a weird thing of trying to maintain a high bar of quality you want to work with, you realize how small the pool is in your immediate surroundings.
Sympathizes with what E said in all hands about how there's a bubble in SF and good quality people to pull from.
E: Stablity/ownership is one of the two big themes I've seen. The other is location based pay.
That makes sense. Especially for people outside the US, there's a tradeoff in life stability vs income. Because usually most European companies have very strong labor laws. Once you're hired it's hard for a company to get rid of you.
With US labor rules it's a lot easier to let someone go. You have to be able to tell an acquaintance "come work at this company for the same pay but less security"


Eng
hey Erika, I was out on PTO. For me a big thing would be the company doing better financially. We've had layoffs and major growth would alleviate concerns of new ones. I can't think of "small wins" that would make much difference. I would still highly recommend working at Sourcegraph for people in Zone 1 and 2, no doubt.
Eng
E: Top of mind?
Message E sent to everyone a couple weeks ago
What have been the themes?
E: More neutral sentiment than negative (or positive), desire for stability, location based pay
Has there been any feedback about the business sentiment?
E: Not as much but some. Largely
Not seeing much growth or signs of future growth. Has heard that pipegen has been challenging.
E: We are seeing some weakness on both pipegen and win rate. Working on making them better, but still need to improve.
Something that came up around the time Corey was leaving was that Tommy was burnt out and frustration with the product. Was giving feedback from the trials but it wasn't being action.
Saw similar feedback from other customers. E.g., Databricks cut back a lot of spend and one of the things they cited was Code Intel, which we also reduced investment.
E: Definitely seeing tension about this. We have some clarification coming that we're an enterprise software company, but there's still the limited resources between new and older parts of product.
People team is getting feedback from folks. Has heard via that that people are really burnt out.
The statement from leadership had been that we were going to do less... but it seems like we're doing more and more.
It feels like we're accelerating the rate of burn out on the company.
E: Working on trying to get more strict about limiting work in progress, focusing for now on Cody Core
Cody Prime seems like it's in the worst state
Doesn't feel like the C-suite understands how much pressure there is on everyone.
At least with the people he's talked with, there's a sense that this will never end
E: Yeah, need to work on a foundation of making sure people are able to do their work, finish it, and have it be valued. This won't solve everything, but it's a foundation.
Sentinel shows that this is a reoccurring pattern that goes back a long time
E: How is it going for Noah personally?
Wants to say it's good, but can't be too detached from how the rest of the company is doing.
Feels that everyone is pressured and that flows down.
E.g., Nelson and the Release team feel more stressed on the Infra side of things.
Being around this makes everyone feel anxious.
Feels particularly hard to take PTO these days. Should have done this. Never feels like the right time.
Within the bubble it's pretty good, but then Quinn appears out of nowhere as a whirlwind
When dealing with people outside of their immediate team, it feels harder to deal with them at the moment. They seem to have so much going on that they don't have the brain cycles to work with Dev Infra
Dev Infra is finding out about issues only days or weeks after they start but that throws a monkey wrench into their plans
Compounding on all this
For all the old timers, there's a feeling that the general culture is being slowly eroded
E: Yeah, it's definitely a culture change. I think individually these changes are for good reasons, but we used to be a company that prided ourselves on being different and with these changes, we're becoming more standard. Justification that "90% of companies do it this way" is true... but the change is that we used to pride ourselves on not being part of that 90%

Survey coding is where you review all of your open-ended, qualitative responses, identify themes or commonalities, and then sort them into categories or groups using tags. The end goal of coding your survey results is to have organized information which you can then further mine for important insights that tell you more about your customer or target audience.

Code these survey responses. The first section, "Prompt", is the prompt that I sent everyone. The second section "Responses" is the collected responses. Each response is separated by a tag of what department it is from, a single line that says either "Eng" "Design" or "Product"

=Prompt=
I sent everyone in EPD (well, design is still pending on Rob’s feedback) this:
(Non-urgent, optional)
What is one thing that would make you feel more enthusiastic recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work?

Context:
The trends in our Lattice anonymous pulse surveys show that EPD is not feeling very enthusiastic about Sourcegraph these days. In particular, our sentiment is trending quite negative on the question:
How likely are you to recommend Sourcegraph as a place to work?

I want us to be a place where people want to work, so I am asking everyone in EPD what we could do better. It doesn't matter (and I don't need to know) what you would answer on the sentiment survey question. Rather, whatever your starting sentiment, I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work. 

I can't say what I can do with the responses until I know the content, but I will read every response and put together a plan. 

Answering is completely optional. Or, if you'd like, you can give more than one thing. I'll take that too. 

Thank you so much!

I feel pretty content but I am still riding new-guy high

I do sense frustration on shifting priorities and being asked to do lots of competing things without enough staffing from a few people.

Like even from $NAME on the $WORK I get the biggest sense of frustration I have seen from him. Not a concern, he is fine. But just in terms of feeling jerked around and expected to make something work without due diligence
Design
(meeting notes) 
Had a retro fresh off the Chris changes. Design before Chris felt like engineering always did what they wanted and design was on back heels. So folks on team wanted to be doing more. When Chris joined, there were tight units, designers were involved in planning and moving things forward. Team is okay with the process updates with Chris gone, but feels like there is a disconnect between what we say we’ll do and what we’ll really be doing. 

We have a new product planning process, we’ve gone through the roadmap. We also have Quinn driving individual efforts and just going forward on individual projects. Team understands this and is fine with it, but that way of working conflicts with how other product teams in the industry works. 

It’s hard to sell this working model to a designer. Can’t easily answer questions on process and planning and how design can influence. 

E.g., design didn’t have a seat at the table in product roadmap planning. Designers feel like they can’t get their proposals through. 

Sentiment was less “this sucks” but more somber and feeling like they want to have reality match what we say. 

Diving into mismatch between what we say and do: we say we want a quality product with quality design. But if design doesn’t have a voice in planning, then the issues they want to advocate for don’t get prioritized and we’ll have low quality design. 

User testing is treated as not important, but then those same things become an issue. We could have gotten ahead of things by listening to issues. Can be doing more to evaluate things with customers to learn and iterate. 

Thing that would help: If Rob could tell designers that we have a top 6 list of priorities from design and they, like GTM, could submit that to Product. And if they could get an item or 2 off that list into priorities, that would help quite a bit. 

Another one: Around the quality of the end result. Spoke with someone who works with customers, and heard a lot of frustration around the quality of the software we’re producing (e.g., JetBrains GA). Frustration is at an all time high. Feels like the SDLC proposal to have QA and user testing built into the schedule would be a good fix. Wants to see some of that before we release it to customers. Especially when we have that feedback in advance (e.g., from design). 

Release process: we released monthly, had quality problems, reduced to quarterly releases, but we didn’t do anything process-wise to fix things. Now we’re shipping monthly, but we still don’t QA in a realistic way. It’s a cultural expectation that engineer dogfooding is sufficient QA. 

When we do user testing before release, we do catch issues and fix them. That’s the biggest thing design could make a difference on. 
Eng
I honestly feel incredibly enthusiastic about recommending Sourcegraph and do every chance I get. I think the thing that would give me the biggest hesitation/pause are as follows - happy to dig deeper into any of these:
lack of clear ownership of product/general product issues
clear pathways for advancement beyond IC5.
Not because people need promotions but direction - we need some Rafals in more classic Principal Engineer roles
Not just because we need their influence, but because we need that model for IC4s and 5s to give them a direction to move
and also to show how to convert good ideas into influence
More service ownership culture in product teams
Matt's doing a good job infusing this and it's not totally absent
But it makes me anxious about referring folks into Infra, when we tell them we don't have clear pathways for escalations to feature owners
General economic/industry anxiety
The market is scary & Sourcegraph is small
There are some existing post-RIF scars here, and I think people still wear it on their sleeves - that can be offputting to candidates

Overall my sentiment about SG is very bullish/positive. I can see how the lack of alignment between Cody & the rest of the company might be really disenfranchising though - it was certainly my biggest source of fear/concern before landing on Pro and is part of my motivation to move to Cody. I think the company's problems are very solvable, but when they are far away/tucked in a corner, it's much scarier.


Product
Here's my take:
we've made almost 0 strides in leveraging context as our differentiator, even though we've been talking about it for >1 year
collaborating with teammates has been very hard. with major timezone differences and the chaos that's slack, it's hard to make sense of what's going on and feel a sense of "working together". I'm hopeful that Linear will help with the former, but things like constant org changes, priority changes, changes in strategy (cough cough embeddings) makes the doing the job a slog and hard for us to execute effectively
our revenue growth is slow, macro aside
comp is very low, our equity when compared against public comps, after exercise costs, is effectively $0
i know we discuss IPO as the aspiration, but I believe if we were to look at things a bit more soberly, I would wager that people see themselves as working jobs and they want to get paid. So if we're not even considering an acquisition that are positive for the shareholder + employee, then that's pretty demotivating. Additionally, I personally find the comparisons to dethroning msft silly if not straight haughty, and i think it does more to demotivate than to inspire confidence

E: Do any of these stick out to you as more important than the others or are they all roughly equal?

in the short term, comp helps. long term we just need to start winning. codeium, github, tabnine, etc are eating our lunch


Eng
No way to grow by learning from others:
EM function was (historically) very weak at Sourcegraph, and while we now have some solid EMs, they still don’t have enough influence to help their reports grow / there’s too few of them
Senior ICs are either siloed, or spend their time juggling multiple fires, and mentoring / being a force multiplier is not valued
The way we build teams means that most people are alone in their timezone, and need to rely on themselves (or connections they can build without anyone helping them)

No way to have impact generally associated with start-ups:
we don’t follow any grand plan, and even if we choose a direction, we either fail to put sufficient resources behind it, or immediately start uncoordinated pivots
ownership (and promotions) are assigned based on proximity to founders, so a newcomer has a very low chance of making major impact
most of our major engineering problems are ignored (and stay unsolved), so it’s unlikely that someone can deliver a major breakthrough

Equity compensation - we tell candidates that “you join a startup due to equity upside”, but our grants are based on a round raised 3 years ago, during an unprecedented valuation bubble, while we were growing 300% YoY.
We now struggle to grow 10% YoY and our FMV is ~11% of Round D, so it would take log_base_1.1 of 9 == 23 years to grow back to our Round D valuation, and:
we don’t have 23 years of runway
even if we got back to Round D valuation, an IC3 grant would end up being worth ~1 year salary (before taxes)
Our location-independent comp made up for this in the past, but for new hires, an IC3 would be much better off doubling down on LeetCode and getting an offer from Big tech (and that’s in a most optimistic scenario for Sourcegraph)

E: Would you rank any of these as more important than the others or are they all roughly equal?

It really depends on what a new hire is looking for (growth / impact / equity upside),  my ex-FAANG colleagues were generally looking for #2 / #3, but we can’t / won’t fix #3, and fixing #1 will help with #2, so, order is roughly #1 -> #2 -> #3?
Design
Hey Erica! Happy to share I’d say…
More gender diversity in hiring (like, aggressively)
All of leadership demonstrating a unified focus on things like inclusion, open/transparent communication, and healthy work practices (not just certain folks at certain times)
Design investment. Workload across product and marketing has grown while our design team has shrunk significantly. I was even told there would be an additional brand designer when I was hired. I’ve since been told that will likely never happen, while the marketing team keeps growing (and their design support needs with it). I’d be very hesitant to recommend a fellow designer join a team that is chronically understaffed. Additionally, design is not represented at the exec level of a company who’s trying to create deeply engaging, high quality, well-crafted experiences. Both of these factors give the impression design is not valued as highly as it ought to be.

E: Do you have a relative ranking between them or are they all roughly equal for you?

I’d say they’re roughly equal
Eng
Reason I won't recommend to friends to work here anymore is zonal pay.
Eng
Two things that would make me more likely to recommend Sourcegraph:
Location-independent pay. Much of my professional network outside Sourcegraph is in Michigan, which is a 20% haircut off of what used to be competitive salaries.
Embracing OSS. I am enthusiastic about working in public, as are many of my peers. The decision to move the monorepo private is a big blow.

E: What about you personally? Beyond the things you mentioned, are there things we can do to improve your happiness in your role

Feels like a waste of an opportunity to ask for change, but I’m actually feeling quite good in my role right now.
So instead, I’ve been really appreciating:
The stability in my team’s work, particularly around the svelte rewrite and the space we’ve had to actually make it lovable
The effort Peter is making to find (and create) opportunities for growth
The telegraphing of incoming change, and the space we’ve been given to prepare for it


Eng
I don't have a solution, but I can explain on why. Kindly keep my response anonymous.
Why I would not recommend others to work at Sourcegraph?
Negative sentiment built up from the past (pre Erika era ) where a group of teammates do not care. I believe passionate people thrive the most when they're working with others who are also passionate. Things are less fun when there's a gap, and energy will wear off over time.
On-call/support rotation was supposed to be a given (as documented in handbook), but some teams did not enforce it. Some engineers I talked to didn't know on-call was a thing. This also contributed to the discrepancy to on-call expectation between Cloud and non-Cloud part of the organization. We advertise Cloud for 24/7 coverage, but we do not have the same commitment across all teams.
Difficult to get help from other engineering teammates. Cloud cares a lot about our customer, and we do what we can to keep things running and them happy. However, I am not thrilled to be the person nudging people for help when it is supposed to be their job. I believe our engineering team can learn from CE teammates about customer obsession.
Comp is no longer attractive to non-US talents due to the zone-based pay policy. In Canada, it's not competitive for senior+ positions; Lack of discretionary budget at EM disposal to provide incentives to retain talents.
Doubt on whether Cody will make us worthy of the 2.7B valuation, and other factors such as ARR growth.
Some of the points above came up a lot when chatting with teammates in private, so I believe I am not the only one feeling this way.
Why I may consider recommending others to join right now?
Things are improving where remaining teammates care a lot more than before, but I still observe from time to time, specific example would be ignoring hard questions despite the subject matter falls under their direct ownership (it's not always worth starting a fight, and we usually just workaround it to unblock customers sooner rather than later).
Better support coverage and on-call practice is on our agenda (per our discussion yesterday), but it will still take time to materialize.
Cody org appears to be more organized now, but again, it will take time to materialize.
Sourcegraph has a cool product to work with and room for growth for the right people.
I am not saying "I am quiting cuz there's so many negative things". In the short run, I am happy with my current position, and working toward making our team to be more sustainable. In the medium/long run, it remains a .


Eng
I think I was probably on the happier end of the survey, probably the very high end, and thus perhaps not as representative.

For me it would be better work-life balance; it’s always hard to disconnect here. I literally took this week off as PTO so that I could focus on work without distractions.

I helped set the potentially unrealistic performance expectations we have on Eng, so obviously it’s a glass house. But the high pressure here, often caused by top-down deadlines, is why I personally feel uncomfortable disconnecting.
Eng
From what I’ve been hearing, enthusiasm has waned largely because of our trend away from features that set us apart from the norm and toward behaviors that mimic those of other companies. It probably started with our move away from OSS last year (do I have my timeline right?). These are changes that favor the corporation, usually at the expense of the employee, like changing the time for exercising options after leaving the company.

I have recently put all of this together in my head, so it’s still kind of raw.  I’m not hearing outright complaints from anyone, but just an undercurrent of comments. I probably couldn’t even point out specifics, except recently Camden PM’d me “this is disappointing” linking to the announcement of making repos private.

Probably the disappointment is there because these teammates viewed these features as reflecting our core values, and now that they’re changing, they’re questioning what our core values are now.
Eng
 What is one thing that would make you feel more enthusiastic recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work?

I never felt negatively in any instance, Instead of recommending Sourcegraph at first place - I proudly talk about the accomplishment SG has did (public info such as milestones, blogs, tweets, conferences) and then try recommending to join SG.

Standing to the above point, I referred couple of my friends (ashok for cody team, venkat for ml) but looks like at they aren't great match to the role while comparing existing candidates. I'll definitely keep recommending SG to my friends/great colleagues 

Thank you


Eng
hi Erika, I will try to be very short and precise to save your time on reading 
in summary:
1. Sourcegraph has very interesting technology stack and good salary, so we are able to hire very good and ambitious people.
2. The ‘problem’ with great engineers and ambitious people is that they want to create things that make impact which last - and here is the issue with Sourcegraph: I guess nobody can promise that the work I (or anyone) is doing now is needed in 2-3 months time, b/c the company strategy is changing so quickly. This led to frustration and also many re-organisations of the company, which caused few laid-offs.
Solution options I could imagine:
Principal/architect group - I worked for many companies, and those having small group of ‘solution architects’ were really successful, have stable crew and were able to keep founders visions compatible with engineering work i.e. even if strategy is changing, they were able to somehow adapt already implemented projects so people felt they work matters.  Good example might be Cloud Team in Sourcegraph - apart from Dax (+4y in one company, which is quite long  ), nobody has left company on its own (some people were fired b/c of company strategy changes though) b/c we had vision (thanks to @Rafal Gajdulewicz) what are building in the long run and we could see the impact
More clear ownership - i.e. Source owns gitserver, so they take responsibility for it (incl. on-call), but when company decides to do something with it, their word matter the most - this way they feel the build and own something, vs being just a simple ‘contractor’
Hope that my loose thoughts can help a bit - happy to answer any questions or clarify things if needed 


Eng
Oh wow! That surprises me. I actually have almost nothing but good things to say about working here.

My only mark against sourcegraph is that they laid off someone I recommended for a job a month into them working here. (This was not a for cause firing). But it was before your time, and honestly I feel like it was the exception for sourcegraph, not the rule.

Speaking to my role as a junior, I feel extremely well-supported and feel that my contributions are noted by my superiors. The compensation is great too. Sorry all I have to say are good things!


Eng
I guess if I had to pick one thing, it would be more transparency into where the company has been and is going. Like, what's the PLAN? "It's a big opportunity", sure, how about some structure and detail and then a strategy to exploit that. I should be able to see the financial statements over years in a PDF, not slides. I miss epigraphs/epitaphs and the Meta practice of badge posts. We could be a bit more self-critical and people leaving is a great time to get open appraisals of that.
Eng


The trends in our Lattice anonymous pulse surveys show that EPD is not feeling very enthusiastic about Sourcegraph these days.
That's unfortunate to hear. But not entirely surprising. Both from what I've heard from other IC engineers, and seen myself, the company has some cultural and execution challenges. Also, FWIW, I may-or-may-not be one of the individuals whose anonymous feedback hasn't been especially positive lately.

... so I am asking everyone in EPD what we could do better. ...
I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work.

I reason I would be hesitant about recommending Sourcegraph to a close friend is because I can only assume they would be just as { frustrated, disappointed, dismayed } at the same things that I am. To put it bluntly, I'm not sure Sourcegraph is a good fit for me in the first place. Let alone such a great place that I would actively try to convince my friends and former colleagues to join.

It pains me to admit that. But I say it because I take great pride in being honest and direct. These are values I care deeply about. Similar values I hold dear are producing high-quality work and shipping software. Which is a great segue into what would make me feel more enthusiastic about Sourcegraph as a place to work.

I would feel more enthusiastic if Sourcegraph shared my values about software engineering, and shipping high-quality software, quickly.

While I do see vestiges of "well constructed" or "intentionally designed" things in the codebase, overall, I just don't get the sense that "high-quality software engineering" is something Sourcegraph cares about. Or is even capable of doing. We talk about it. But I've never actually seen it. I would describe the engineering culture here as a bunch of open-source hackers that just happen to get paid. I see individuals adding one-of features or hacks for high-priority customers, without any regard for the overall product. Or the system we are now maintaining. Or with an eye towards how we can make the overall codebase easier to understand or more reliable.

If you need concrete examples of (IMO) unacceptably low engineering standards, or completely careless design decisions, I can provide you with all the receipts you need.

And this tension -- how I view my own "seriousness" when it comes to creating software vs. the reality at Sourcegraph -- is really draining.  And as you are already aware, this tension is leading conflicts between me and other members of the team. Who may not feel as strongly about "engineering rigor" as I do. Or who believe -- perhaps correctly so! -- that Sourcegraph doesn't require that high of a bar with regard to standards.

For me, it's hard to be enthusiastic about building a product in this environment. But let me come at this from another direction:

I currently experience the text-book definition of burnout. And I have no doubt that my (loving and supportive) management would encourage me to take some time off. But the work isn't the problem. I'm not burnt out because I spent a good chunk of my weekend writing unit tests. In fact, I like the work. I'm proud of the work. I sincerely value making an improvement to the codebase and product.

The sense of burnout stems from my values not being shared by the organization.

If I didn't write those tests, and just went ahead with a large refactoring project... I doubt anybody would push back. In fact, I know there wouldn't be any push-back. Because who is going to be championing the need for that sort of thing? Certainly not whomever reviewed the initial PR that added all the code in the first place.

Pivoting back to the "enthusiasm about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work". If I think about my potential future at the company, is this it? Spending the next several years of my career carefully refactoring a technical debt and undoing haphazardly made product decisions? All while struggling to avoid alienating my colleagues with my unreasonably high expectations for code quality? Or for reliability? I don't want to be that crochet asshole that's always complaining about things.

It's A-OK if Sourcegraph doesn't aim to treat code quality or service reliability as seriously as, say, Google. But for me personally, if Sourcegraph did value these things as highly as Google, it would make me more enthused about working here. And on a product that aims to help developers do a thing that I am very passionate about.

So my ramblings about discontent and ennui aside, here are some concrete suggestions for what IMHO would make it easier to recommend Sourcegraph as a place to work for other engineers:
Focus. Not talk about focus. Not say we "will start to focus". But actually set out to build a product, and not a growing collection of hacks that approximate a product. (Exercise: Go look at the Linear projects in-flight, and then tell me what the "themes" the engineering team should be thinking about. Or what the top-level selling points will be for the next release.) Also it, seems odd that both the CEO and CTO both have their own one-off pet projects. It's none of my business and all... but if we are thinking about building X, then we should design and build X. Not hack together a tech demo, and then throw it over to someone like Chris Smith to build a "product" out of it.
Follow industry practices. If something is a big enough problem that we create an #inc-XXX channel, then it's surprising that there is no follow-up. Why don't we write, socialize, and review post-mortems? And then follow-up on the action items. And have accountability to ensure that we don't make the same mistakes again. I am perpetually shocked this isn't already the case. (Similarly, I have "notes" on how how Sourcegraph has approached operations and oncall for things like Cody Gateway.)
Live a product-focused world view. I don't know when Search jobs or Teams shipped. But at what point do their "Beta" and "Experimental" labels just communicate a sense of abandonment and neglect to our customers? I have heard repeatedly, from many people all across the company that historically we have perpetually fallen into the trap of "chasing some shiny new thing"... so perhaps this is just what we collectively accept is part of our DNA at Sourcegraph. But personally, that's not something I'm enthusiastic about.

Anyways, hopefully that is clear enough to be helpful in some way. If there is anything I can do to help you in your endeavor please let me know. Cheers!

I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work.
I've given this a good think and its really hard to answer. I've typed up and then deleted messages quite a lot  , my quarterly check in is coming up soon ad maybe I can discuss further then.
The two main things:
A reduction in the culture of heroics and more focus on health of teams
More confidence that engineering and customer feedback is making it to leadership and product. (sometimes sg feels very catch 22, I've personally seen some serious grapevine comms)
I honestly think a lot of what has hurt morale is just a long tail of beloved coworkers quitting or being laid off. I know the layoffs were awhile ago, but they had a major impact. Happy to chat more in our forthcoming quarterly check in.


Eng
Thanks for reaching out Erika !!

So far, I have felt very positive about working at Sourcegraph and I genuinely enjoy collaborating with such amazing colleagues. The clear direction from our leadership on the projects I am working on has been incredibly helpful. The direct involvement of Beyang and Rishabh in these projects has provided a clear scope, regular feedback on progress, and insights into potential improvements.

Additionally, our daily standups are very beneficial for discussing progress and updates. These meetings are really helpful for me to communicate any blockers I face, receiving early feedback on ongoing projects, and staying connected with the team. Another benefit of having daily standups I feel is that they reduce the burden of updating every detail on Slack (which takes a bit more time), and it is often faster to simply discuss with the group and take notes of high-level points.

I want to know what would make you, personally, feel more enthusiastic than you currently are about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work.

I thought a lot about this specifically about this exact question and couldn't come up with a great answer. But lets explore this a bit

Firstly, would I recommend Sourcegraph as a place to work to a colleague?

Actually I would, I recommended one of my previous sub managers to a role at sourcegraph recently(They are from Boston).

 Would I recommend it to every colleague?

I would absolutely recommend but I would offer some caveats
Timings : Firstly in certain teams if you are a manager/High level IC(which I am not) it would be much much nicer to be in North America than not.  That's not necessarily a sourcegraph thing but a team thing. I personally work quite late in Europe time fairly regularly not necessarily because I have to but because its more convenient and I personally don't mind because I get a lot of meaning out of working at sourcegraph(These are my personal feelings and can't be extrapolated to everyone though). If I didn't work later in european time things might be harder in communication coz if you look at a lot of low latency communications I had in the last few weeks they were all early in North America time and later in europe time. Note: once again I really don't mind this much coz I am young and single so my life priorities are slightly different right now. I would probably be living a different life in a few years though.  Also, I can think of some people who had issues with the late times in europe mainly because of family commitments etc(which are very understandable concerns).
Tooling : Another aspect that some people might find mildly confusing is the frequent changes in our tooling. This is something where I think the product managers might have more insight, but I’ve noticed that we sometimes switch tools without clear reasoning. For example, we’ve used GitHub, GitHub Issues, and GitHub’s project board in the past, and now we use Linear. Personally, I find Linear harder to use because I’m not sure how it all integrates. Additionally, we use various apps, the handbook, and Notion, which adds to the confusion. This tooling inconsistency makes me question if it actually boosts our productivity.

Those are the main points I can think of. Despite these issues, I want to emphasize that I really enjoy working at Sourcegraph. It’s the most meaningful job I’ve had in my career, and I would still absolutely recommend to everyone as a great place to work. While these issues don’t personally bother me (mainly because I am an IC who gets to work on really cool problems day to day) but I can understand why they might be a concern for others as I have seen other people mention these things to me.

Hey Erika, thanks for reaching out. For what it's worth I recommended a candidate recently.
I've got two things that make me less likely to recommend SG to a friend/ex-colleague
Recommending that someone come work with me knowing they'll only make 60% of what I make because of location-based pay makes me very uncomfortable
I feel like communication and marketing have recently become more AI-hype focused than I feel comfortable with. I'd be much more comfortable being loud about Sourcegraph if that wouldn't mean putting "All programmers will be replaced by AI in the next 5 years" content on my mostly language/compiler focused followers/mutuals (they know better).


Eng
The biggest downside right now is probably the region-based salaries. Living in Zone 3, I find it a bit harder to recommend SG to local folks I know since the 40% drop from Zone 1 can be a bit much. I'd also feel a bit guilty because I've been grandfathered in and they'd be making significantly less for the same work.

I know a lot has been said about this so I won't prattle on too much - it's a difficult problem and I don't really have any good, non-obvious suggestions.

E: If you have an opinion on this, I'd love your thought on if it's location based pay in general that is problematic or if it's the steepness of our drop. (Or some other aspect!)

It's probably a bit of both to be honest 🤷Location-based pay seems a bit unequitable in general... And our drops are indeed steep, to the point where we aren't the clear choice for the best folks we are trying to hire in zones 3 & 4 IMO. 
Eng
Good question, and I am happy that you're top of that.
As for me, I am pretty happy and excited to work here and continuously recommend my friends to work here! I am eager to have the JD of both Dax and Eric replacements to broadcast to them all!
I am also very happy that we found our way to communicate and we are working great together (well, at least from my POV :)).
Ah... I did not have a chance yet to thank you for backing me up on discussions with other teams. THANK YOU! 
-----
As you seek data points, I will list things I heard that could be of interest to you...
I often hear complaints from the people I talk with about some things in the company that I could imagine factor into the question above. I will list a few that I heard of (and keep in mind that I can't say for certain that these would necessary mean those folks were necessarily unhappy.)
The thing we discussed earlier about the rumor that if you're not working on something shiny, you get bad reviews
If you are not the DRI of something you don't get credit
Quinn's "dive bombs" into threads (actual phrasing I heard) that wreaks havoc in the priorities and force moving to a "show better light to the boss" which may not be the best course of action for the issue at hand
In the case of the Release team, their extreme difficulty in working with TS
These are not Infra-specific, but I am combating them as if they were to help.
In the Infra, I have been working on all of them:
Communicating #1 and #2 from our chat. I may do some more broadcasts to help curb that rumor.
For #3, you and I worked with Quinn to help coordinate better with the teams.
And for #4 we are actively working with Aimee and Andrew to improve.


Eng
I am generally enthusiastic about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work. If asked about the qualities that contribute to success at Sourcegraph, besides strong technical skills, I would highlight the ability to handle ambiguity, self-motivation to overcome obstacles, proactivity, strong communication skills, and openness to changing teams and adapting to shifting priorities.
Eng
I consistently answer “yes” to this question - no need to hide anything here. I like the place, the people, and the work. However if I would recommend a friend to work here, I have a very high bar for “strong yes”, since anything negative when I recommend the place will also affect the personal relationship.
What would it take for me to say strong yes:
Recommending a place to work means I think they are a really good fit for some role. We’ve had a lot of team instability and last minute reassignments of new hires in the past year or so, so even if I would think person X is a great fit for “git expert on source”, I would not be certain they would actually join for that in the end, or they might be reassigned to something else within 6 months, and then the job might not necessarily match their skill set or interests anymore.
I would love a longer-term roadmap than just 3-6 months so that I can tell people more about our vision and a rough idea of “what they’d do in 1y from now” - are we gonna build self-driving cars, context sources, or excavators kind of level precision.
Low impact, but I noticed that I thought about that before: People will be comparing total compensation as part of the offer, and I don’t have a great handle on “how much is stock worth” at the moment, so I wouldn’t know if I can tell them “yes Sourcegraph could pay comparably to company X that offered you Y dollars”. It’s been a few years since we had our last investment round, the market changed two times since then and we have about zero idea about the value.


Eng
I think the 2 major factors which play a role here, based on my own assessment and the feedback I collected from the departures in the last 6 months are:
constant change.
not feeling appreciated.


Eng
In the pursuit of AI-associated $$$ and growth, I think we are:
Doing a disservice to our existing customers who have brought us to this strage by having many important functions on life support
Losing differentiation
Harming our brand (see point 1 for enterprise features) and for PLG, we say "Unlimited Autocompletions", but I keep hearing reports of people running into rate limiting, we've had to walk back statements related to "Graph context" in messaging.
Not consistently engineering things in a way that's built to last (e.g. OpenCtx -- look at the amount of feature code vs tests -- calling some APIs is of course easy, the challenge is going to be enterprise customizations and maintenance, which makes having solid testing infrastructure vital).
When I joined 2.5 years back, I had a very clear picture of how Sourcegraph was different from every other dev tool company, and how it could lean into that more. At this point, it feels like we're becoming more like a mish-mash of other companies in the space without a clear identity.

I know that sounds quite negative, but I'm here because I think there's still a bunch of smart, well-intentioned people here who care about improving the customer & user experience as a whole.
Eng
tl;dr: Sourcegraph is a nice place to work, but I wouldn't recommend it to my peers in Germany because the recent salary change has made it uncompetitive.
Eng
The two main themes that stand out for me are:
There’s been quite a lot of changes in the past 8 months or so. I totally understand that this is now new in the startup scene but the frequency of these changes kind of feel like we aren’t stable and anything can happen at anytime.
The second is because of these frequent changes, a lot of folks are getting burned out and i think that is the reason for the negative reviews on Lattice.
Apologies for the late reply, it’s been a packed week for me.
Eng
it’s been awhile since i do the pulse surveys but i’d still recommend Sourcegraph to people that I want to work with, i’m just not sure about things that’d make me feel more enthusiastic about it :lolsob: I will think about this over the weekend and let you know next week!
Eng
I think I’d press the ⅗ or  ⅘ button, depending on mood.
To get me to 5 / 5, I think:
Better management – many 1-1s canceled, didn’t have the min. 25 min/week, today’s is my 3rd 1-1 canceled without notice in a row.
Less ambiguity (the bad type)

Verbal follow-up notes:
Management
Heard people complain about management in general. Lots of manager changes. Many managers don't provide a lot of people management to people.
Really important to have a manager who he can discuss things with.
Has had 7-8 managers so far in a bit over 2 years.
In many of these cases, didn't get a monthly 1:1 regularly.
When there aren't regular 1:1s you get unhealthy corridor talk
Ambiguity
Still finds it difficult to explain to people his role before. Now he's clearly in an IC role. But for the last half year it was hard to tell. Had one person on his team, another person he was kind of dotted line managing. Didn't really understand the role expectations.
E: Other?
Would like a greater sense of job security. Layoffs were nearly a year ago, but still feels threatened about that. If fired tomorrow, would feel a lot less surprised than he would have a year ago.
Expectation for a healthy environment is that he could trust the company that if he under performed against expectations he would get very clear feedback and have time to improve. Unexpected termination happened to many people and it generated insecurity.
Feels very sad about the monorepo going private. Understands the reasoning and it makes sense. But also it was a huge plus to him that his work was out in the public. Not a great feeling.
Would originally have been a 6/5. The decrease is largely due to the culture changes. But is still very enthusiastic about the people and the quality of our talent. Also very excited about the space where we are. AI assistant space is something he's really enthusiastic about.
Eng
EPD AMA is today, so I might have missed the wagon, but still dropping some thoughts just in case:

If I can quote only one thing, it would be just more stability. I wish I could be sure of not just what tomorrow is going to be about, but at least up to the next month too.

It feels we're constantly in conflict in between making sure we ship a stable/reliable products to our customers and at the same time, we're in pioneering mode with Cody. It feels we're constantly on edge trying to reconcile the two. We want to be better at planning and less unpredictable in how we work, but then an event will whirlwind into that and it feels like we're back to square one.

Sometimes I feel we get asked about our opinions, without fully understanding what will happen out of it [1] and it contributes to that sentiment. To be perfectly honest, it's always at the back of my head when SQS asks something.

Just a little example: as much as I like and strongly agree with the decision to switch to a monorepo and making it private, which for the latter is something that I mentioned a few times as problematic, I realized while writing this, why are we sharing that decision so hastily? But for example on that one I didn't think for a second that this would lead to "let's make it private right now".

Can't we slow things down for a bit, work out a plan and announce that we're putting on the roadmap to make sg/sg private? The decisions for everything going in sg/sg says that it's effective immediately. I suppose it's mostly about new initiatives, not about "hey folks, merge your code back in sg right now!". The "what a friday from @joe (go/joe-ooo)" is saying out loud what I suspect a lot of us think.

Perhaps I'm just reading this example wrong though. Please tell me if that's the case, it would help me a ton. I also believe I should stand up more for this type of things, but often it feels like I'm not answering asap, the decision will happen before I could even get back to the thread.

[1]: Not saying I'm against fast decisions at all, I'm a strong supporter of the "boss is the boss, period", we need leaders to call the shots, otherwise it derives into zombie mode and nothing happens and we slowly die (edit: as a company, let's not make it too dramatic ) 
Eng
Hey Erika. I think the main thing for me that makes me not want to recommend Sourcegraph as a place of work currently is due to the zone based pay. I feel our current designation (Zone 3) for South Africa is unwarrented but I haven’t had the time to gather proof why
Eng (meeting notes)

eNPS
Was trying to type a thing there
Feeling of not being able to focus on anything makes it hard to feel like he would recommend someone to work here. Makes it feel like this isn't for just anyone.
E: What would increase the sense the stability enough to be worth recommending?
Not sure if it's a team specific thing.
When they were still split between having IAM and Repo team, it felt like he could take a lot more ownership of IAM related things, like code host connections. Ownership is the right term. You see an issue and can just fix it.
Now, attention is super divided between just about everything. Every time you come back to something, even something you worked on last month, it feels like new code.
Also, just doesn't know anyone he would recommend a job to. A lot of people he knows wouldn't be a good fit for Sourcegraph.
E: Have seen examples like this too.
It's a weird thing of trying to maintain a high bar of quality you want to work with, you realize how small the pool is in your immediate surroundings.
Sympathizes with what E said in all hands about how there's a bubble in SF and good quality people to pull from.
E: Stablity/ownership is one of the two big themes I've seen. The other is location based pay.
That makes sense. Especially for people outside the US, there's a tradeoff in life stability vs income. Because usually most European companies have very strong labor laws. Once you're hired it's hard for a company to get rid of you.
With US labor rules it's a lot easier to let someone go. You have to be able to tell an acquaintance "come work at this company for the same pay but less security"


Eng
hey Erika, I was out on PTO. For me a big thing would be the company doing better financially. We've had layoffs and major growth would alleviate concerns of new ones. I can't think of "small wins" that would make much difference. I would still highly recommend working at Sourcegraph for people in Zone 1 and 2, no doubt.
Eng
E: Top of mind?
Message E sent to everyone a couple weeks ago
What have been the themes?
E: More neutral sentiment than negative (or positive), desire for stability, location based pay
Has there been any feedback about the business sentiment?
E: Not as much but some. Largely
Not seeing much growth or signs of future growth. Has heard that pipegen has been challenging.
E: We are seeing some weakness on both pipegen and win rate. Working on making them better, but still need to improve.
Something that came up around the time Corey was leaving was that Tommy was burnt out and frustration with the product. Was giving feedback from the trials but it wasn't being action.
Saw similar feedback from other customers. E.g., Databricks cut back a lot of spend and one of the things they cited was Code Intel, which we also reduced investment.
E: Definitely seeing tension about this. We have some clarification coming that we're an enterprise software company, but there's still the limited resources between new and older parts of product.
People team is getting feedback from folks. Has heard via that that people are really burnt out.
The statement from leadership had been that we were going to do less... but it seems like we're doing more and more.
It feels like we're accelerating the rate of burn out on the company.
E: Working on trying to get more strict about limiting work in progress, focusing for now on Cody Core
Cody Prime seems like it's in the worst state
Doesn't feel like the C-suite understands how much pressure there is on everyone.
At least with the people he's talked with, there's a sense that this will never end
E: Yeah, need to work on a foundation of making sure people are able to do their work, finish it, and have it be valued. This won't solve everything, but it's a foundation.
Sentinel shows that this is a reoccurring pattern that goes back a long time
E: How is it going for Noah personally?
Wants to say it's good, but can't be too detached from how the rest of the company is doing.
Feels that everyone is pressured and that flows down.
E.g., Nelson and the Release team feel more stressed on the Infra side of things.
Being around this makes everyone feel anxious.
Feels particularly hard to take PTO these days. Should have done this. Never feels like the right time.
Within the bubble it's pretty good, but then Quinn appears out of nowhere as a whirlwind
When dealing with people outside of their immediate team, it feels harder to deal with them at the moment. They seem to have so much going on that they don't have the brain cycles to work with Dev Infra
Dev Infra is finding out about issues only days or weeks after they start but that throws a monkey wrench into their plans
Compounding on all this
For all the old timers, there's a feeling that the general culture is being slowly eroded
E: Yeah, it's definitely a culture change. I think individually these changes are for good reasons, but we used to be a company that prided ourselves on being different and with these changes, we're becoming more standard. Justification that "90% of companies do it this way" is true... but the change is that we used to pride ourselves on not being part of that 90%

### Assistant - 2024-07-02 15:53:48

Here are the survey responses coded into categories/tags based on common themes:

### Themes:
1. **Job Satisfaction**
2. **Process and Priorities**
3. **Compensation and Pay Structure**
4. **Work Environment and Culture**
5. **Leadership and Management**
6. **Communication and Transparency**
7. **Growth and Development Opportunities**

### Responses:

**Eng**
- **Job Satisfaction:** "I feel pretty content but I am still riding new-guy high"
- **Process and Priorities:** "I do sense frustration on shifting priorities and being asked to do lots of competing things without enough staffing from a few people."

**Design**
- **Leadership and Management:** "Had a retro fresh off the Chris changes. Design before Chris felt like engineering always did what they wanted and design was on back heels. So folks on team wanted to be doing more. When Chris joined, there were tight units, designers were involved in planning and moving things forward."
- **Process and Priorities:** "Team is okay with the process updates with Chris gone, but feels like there is a disconnect between what we say we’ll do and what we’ll really be doing."
- **Communication and Transparency:** "It’s hard to sell this working model to a designer. Can’t easily answer questions on process and planning and how design can influence."
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "Design didn’t have a seat at the table in product roadmap planning. Designers feel like they can’t get their proposals through."

**Eng**
- **Job Satisfaction:** "I honestly feel incredibly enthusiastic about recommending Sourcegraph and do every chance I get."
- **Process and Priorities:** "lack of clear ownership of product/general product issues"
- **Growth and Development Opportunities:** "clear pathways for advancement beyond IC5."
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "More service ownership culture in product teams"

**Product**
- **Process and Priorities:** "we've made almost 0 strides in leveraging context as our differentiator, even though we've been talking about it for >1 year"
- **Communication and Transparency:** "collaborating with teammates has been very hard. with major timezone differences and the chaos that's slack, it's hard to make sense of what's going on and feel a sense of 'working together'."
- **Compensation and Pay Structure:** "comp is very low, our equity when compared against public comps, after exercise costs, is effectively $0"

**Eng**
- **Growth and Development Opportunities:** "No way to grow by learning from others: EM function was (historically) very weak at Sourcegraph"
- **Leadership and Management:** "Senior ICs are either siloed, or spend their time juggling multiple fires, and mentoring / being a force multiplier is not valued"
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "ownership (and promotions) are assigned based on proximity to founders, so a newcomer has a very low chance of making major impact"

**Design**
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** "More gender diversity in hiring (like, aggressively)"
- **Leadership and Management:** "All of leadership demonstrating a unified focus on things like inclusion, open/transparent communication, and healthy work practices (not just certain folks at certain times)"
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "Design investment. Workload across product and marketing has grown while our design team has shrunk significantly."

**Eng**
- **Compensation and Pay Structure:** "Reason I won't recommend to friends to work here anymore is zonal pay."

**Eng**
- **Compensation and Pay Structure:** "Location-independent pay. Much of my professional network outside Sourcegraph is in Michigan, which is a 20% haircut off of what used to be competitive salaries."
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "Embracing OSS. I am enthusiastic about working in public, as are many of my peers. The decision to move the monorepo private is a big blow."

**Eng**
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "Negative sentiment built up from the past (pre Erika era ) where a group of teammates do not care."
- **Leadership and Management:** "On-call/support rotation was supposed to be a given (as documented in handbook), but some teams did not enforce it."
- **Compensation and Pay Structure:** "Comp is no longer attractive to non-US talents due to the zone-based pay policy."

**Eng**
- **Job Satisfaction:** "For me it would be better work-life balance; it’s always hard to disconnect here."

**Eng**
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "From what I’ve been hearing, enthusiasm has waned largely because of our trend away from features that set us apart from the norm and toward behaviors that mimic those of other companies."

**Eng**
- **Job Satisfaction:** "I never felt negatively in any instance, Instead of recommending Sourcegraph at first place - I proudly talk about the accomplishment SG has did."

**Eng**
- **Leadership and Management:** "Sourcegraph has very interesting technology stack and good salary, so we are able to hire very good and ambitious people."
- **Process and Priorities:** "The problem with great engineers and ambitious people is that they want to create things that make impact which last - and here is the issue with Sourcegraph: I guess nobody can promise that the work I (or anyone) is doing now is needed in 2-3 months time, b/c the company strategy is changing so quickly."

**Eng**
- **Job Satisfaction:** "Oh wow! That surprises me. I actually have almost nothing but good things to say about working here."

**Eng**
- **Communication and Transparency:** "I guess if I had to pick one thing, it would be more transparency into where the company has been and is going."

**Eng**
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "I reason I would be hesitant about recommending Sourcegraph to a close friend is because I can only assume they would be just as { frustrated, disappointed, dismayed } at the same things that I am."

**Eng**
- **Work Environment and Culture:** "A reduction in the culture of heroics and more focus on health of teams."

**Eng**
- **Job Satisfaction:** "So far, I have felt very positive about working at Sourcegraph and I genuinely enjoy collaborating with such amazing colleagues."

**Eng**

Hi Erika, sorry for the delay in gathering my thoughts on this. I had this typed out but wanted to really think through it.
I currently recommend SG to my friends to apply, I have over the years sent along quite a few referrals, unfortunately they got close but were not the right fit for the roles.
However, recent changes have definitely reduced the monetary differentiation factor that made Sourcegraph more attractive in the past.  Of course that cant be helped but I think outside of a buy-in towards the vision of the company, we need to do things that differentiate us in the hiring phase. This will allow us to differentiate the company when pitching it to others. Maybe we need to update our benefits to stand out or maybe its something else but currently we stand either near or at industry norm in terms of benefits, pay and equity so we aren’t standing out above the rest.
Another reason I could see is that our culture has shifted significantly since I joined and it was one of the reasons why I was attracted to working here. However, now its less focused on the things that made our culture the differentiating factor. So maybe a focus on culture change towards the values we had before would go a long way.
The last thing is that we should address the reason for the number of departures recently since that can give people pause in terms of recommending to work here. I think addressing the root cause and working on retention would make teammates have confidence in recommending others to work here.
I am not sure if i provided an answer or i am just as vague as the question was  but these were some of the thoughts on my mind about this topic.

Heya! I believe @Eric Shamow shared a Stephen rant’ document with you, which was greatly inspired by that^ question (in addition to some questions I got from others recently.) In case he didn’t, here it is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17kH4y6vPYjWN8yPuSGfc09ReVW554teB2OAEAow4SJI/edit?usp=sharing
If you’d rather not read the whole thing (sorry for the lengthy doc), the tl;dr for my answer is that Sourcegraph is engineered/architected to be a technical system that 200 engineers maintain and work on, but we’ve only got 50 today. The result is that there are many different competing standards everywhere you look - and so it doesn’t matter which part of the engineering org you join, there will be great inconsistencies in how we do everything and it will be a great source of frustration, slowness, a challenge when getting alignment, etc. that you’ll just have to deal with. and there’s not much investment in reducing complexity to counteract it.
If we could address that more, I’d feel more enthusiastic recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work

Here is the final list of codes I settled on:
Async
Company Growth
Compensation and Pay Structure
Culture
Growth and Development Opportunities
Job Satisfaction
Leadership and Management
Process
Product/Engineering Quality
Roadmap
Stability
Work Environment

Here is the final set of coded comments: 
Async	collaborating with teammates has been very hard. with major timezone differences and the chaos that's slack, it's hard to make sense of what's going on and feel a sense of 'working together'.
Async	The way we build teams means that most people are alone in their timezone, and need to rely on themselves (or connections they can build without anyone helping them)
Async	Firstly in certain teams if you are a manager/High level IC(which I am not) it would be much much nicer to be in North America than not. 
Company Growth	For me a big thing would be the company doing better financially.  We've had layoffs and major growth would alleviate concerns of new ones.
Company Growth	"our revenue growth is slow, macro aside

comp is very low, our equity when compared against public comps, after exercise costs, is effectively $0

i know we discuss IPO as the aspiration, but I believe if we were to look at things a bit more soberly, I would wager that people see themselves as working jobs and they want to get paid. So if we're not even considering an acquisition that are positive for the shareholder + employee, then that's pretty demotivating. Additionally, I personally find the comparisons to dethroning msft silly if not straight haughty, and i think it does more to demotivate than to inspire confidence"
Company Growth	Not seeing much growth or signs of future growth. Has heard that pipegen has been challenging.
Company Growth	"Equity compensation - we tell candidates that “you join a startup due to equity upside”, but our grants are based on a round raised 3 years ago, during an unprecedented valuation bubble, while we were growing 300% YoY.

We now struggle to grow 10% YoY and our FMV is ~11% of Round D, so it would take log_base_1.1 of 9 == 23 years to grow back to our Round D valuation, and:

- we don’t have 23 years of runway
- even if we got back to Round D valuation, an IC3 grant would end up being worth ~1 year salary (before taxes)

Our location-independent comp made up for this in the past, but for new hires, an IC3 would be much better off doubling down on LeetCode and getting an offer from Big tech (and that’s in a most optimistic scenario for Sourcegraph)"
Company Growth	Doubt on whether Cody will make us worthy of the 2.7B valuation, and other factors such as ARR growth.
Company Growth	Low impact, but I noticed that I thought about that before: People will be comparing total compensation as part of the offer, and I don’t have a great handle on “how much is stock worth” at the moment, so I wouldn’t know if I can tell them “yes Sourcegraph could pay comparably to company X that offered you Y dollars”. It’s been a few years since we had our last investment round, the market changed two times since then and we have about zero idea about the value.
Compensation and Pay Structure	Reason I won't recommend to friends to work here anymore is zonal pay.
Compensation and Pay Structure	Location-independent pay. Much of my professional network outside Sourcegraph is in Michigan, which is a 20% haircut off of what used to be competitive salaries.
Compensation and Pay Structure	Comp is no longer attractive to non-US talents due to the zone-based pay policy.
Compensation and Pay Structure	I've got two things that make me less likely to recommend SG to a friend/ex-colleague: Recommending that someone come work with me knowing they'll only make 60% of what I make because of location-based pay makes me very uncomfortable.
Compensation and Pay Structure	The biggest downside right now is probably the region-based salaries. Living in Zone 3, I find it a bit harder to recommend SG to local folks I know since the 40% drop from Zone 1 can be a bit much.
Compensation and Pay Structure	tl;dr: Sourcegraph is a nice place to work, but I wouldn't recommend it to my peers in Germany because the recent salary change has made it uncompetitive.
Compensation and Pay Structure	Hey Erika. I think the main thing for me that makes me not want to recommend Sourcegraph as a place of work currently is due to the zone based pay.
Compensation and Pay Structure	"However, recent changes have definitely reduced the monetary differentiation factor that made Sourcegraph more attractive in the past.

Of course that can't be helped but I think outside of a buy-in towards the vision of the company, we need to do things that differentiate us in the hiring phase. This will allow us to differentiate the company when pitching it to others. Maybe we need to update our benefits to stand out or maybe it's something else but currently we stand either near or at industry norm in terms of benefits, pay, and equity so we aren’t standing out above the rest."
Compensation and Pay Structure	I would still highly recommend working at Sourcegraph for people in Zone 1 and 2, no doubt.
Culture	ownership (and promotions) are assigned based on proximity to founders, so a newcomer has a very low chance of making major impact
Culture	Embracing OSS. I am enthusiastic about working in public, as are many of my peers. The decision to move the monorepo private is a big blow.
Culture	A reduction in the culture of heroics and more focus on health of teams.
Culture	Another reason I could see is that our culture has shifted significantly since I joined and it was one of the reasons why I was attracted to working here. However, now it's less focused on the things that made our culture the differentiating factor.
Culture	When I joined 2.5 years back, I had a very clear picture of how Sourcegraph was different from every other dev tool company, and how it could lean into that more. At this point, it feels like we're becoming more like a mish-mash of other companies in the space without a clear identity.
Diversity and Inclusion	More gender diversity in hiring (like, aggressively)
Growth and Development Opportunities	clear pathways for advancement beyond IC5.
Growth and Development Opportunities	No way to grow by learning from others: EM function was (historically) very weak at Sourcegraph
Job Satisfaction	 i’d still recommend Sourcegraph to people that I want to work with
Job Satisfaction	I think I was probably on the happier end of the survey, probably the very high end, and thus perhaps not as representative.
Job Satisfaction	I feel pretty content but I am still riding new-guy high
Job Satisfaction	I honestly feel incredibly enthusiastic about recommending Sourcegraph and do every chance I get.
Job Satisfaction	I never felt negatively in any instance, Instead of recommending Sourcegraph at first place - I proudly talk about the accomplishment SG has did.
Job Satisfaction	Oh wow! That surprises me. I actually have almost nothing but good things to say about working here.
Job Satisfaction	So far, I have felt very positive about working at Sourcegraph and I genuinely enjoy collaborating with such amazing colleagues.
Job Satisfaction	As for me, I am pretty happy and excited to work here and continuously recommend my friends to work here!
Job Satisfaction	I am generally enthusiastic about recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work.
Job Satisfaction	I consistently answer 'yes' to this question - no need to hide anything here. I like the place, the people, and the work.
Job Satisfaction	it’s been awhile since i do the pulse surveys but i’d still recommend Sourcegraph to people that I want to work with.
Job Satisfaction	I currently recommend SG to my friends to apply, I have over the years sent along quite a few referrals, unfortunately they got close but were not the right fit for the roles.
Job Satisfaction	Sourcegraph has very interesting technology stack and good salary, so we are able to hire very good and ambitious people.
Job Satisfaction	For me it would be better work-life balance; it’s always hard to disconnect here.
Job Satisfaction	Senior ICs are either siloed, or spend their time juggling multiple fires, and mentoring / being a force multiplier is not valued
Leadership and Management	All of leadership demonstrating a unified focus on things like inclusion, open/transparent communication, and healthy work practices (not just certain folks at certain times)
Leadership and Management	Better management – many 1-1s canceled, didn’t have the min. 25 min/week, today’s is my 3rd 1-1 canceled without notice in a row.
Process	Had a retro fresh off the Chris changes. Design before Chris felt like engineering always did what they wanted and design was on back heels. So folks on team wanted to be doing more. When Chris joined, there were tight units, designers were involved in planning and moving things forward.
Process	Team is okay with the process updates with Chris gone, but feels like there is a disconnect between what we say we’ll do and what we’ll really be doing.
Process	It’s hard to sell this working model [lots of change, CEO driving individual projects] to a designer. Can’t easily answer questions on process and planning and how design can influence.
Process	Design didn’t have a seat at the table in product roadmap planning. Designers feel like they can’t get their proposals through.
Process	Design investment. Workload across product and marketing has grown while our design team has shrunk significantly.
Process	Another aspect that some people might find mildly confusing is the frequent changes in our tooling. This is something where I think the product managers might have more insight, but I’ve noticed that we sometimes switch tools without clear reasoning. For example, we’ve used GitHub, GitHub Issues, and GitHub’s project board in the past, and now we use Linear. Personally, I find Linear harder to use because I’m not sure how it all integrates. Additionally, we use various apps, the handbook, and Notion, which adds to the confusion. This tooling inconsistency makes me question if it actually boosts our productivity.
Product/Engineering Quality	lack of clear ownership of product/general product issues
Product/Engineering Quality	More confidence that engineering and customer feedback is making it to leadership and product. 
Product/Engineering Quality	Sourcegraph is engineered/architected to be a technical system that 200 engineers maintain and work on, but we’ve only got 50 today. The result is that there are many different competing standards everywhere you look - and so it doesn’t matter which part of the engineering org you join, there will be great inconsistencies in how we do everything and it will be a great source of frustration, slowness, a challenge when getting alignment, etc. that you’ll just have to deal with. and there’s not much investment in reducing complexity to counteract it.
Product/Engineering Quality	most of our major engineering problems are ignored (and stay unsolved), so it’s unlikely that someone can deliver a major breakthrough
Product/Engineering Quality	It feels we're constantly in conflict in between making sure we ship a stable/reliable products to our customers and at the same time, we're in pioneering mode with Cody. It feels we're constantly on edge trying to reconcile the two. 
Product/Engineering Quality	More service ownership culture in product teams
Product/Engineering Quality	On-call/support rotation was supposed to be a given (as documented in handbook), but some teams did not enforce it.
Product/Engineering Quality	I would feel more enthusiastic if Sourcegraph shared my values about software engineering, and shipping high-quality software, quickly.
Roadmap	I guess if I had to pick one thing, it would be more transparency into where the company has been and is going.
Roadmap	I feel like communication and marketing have recently become more AI-hype focused than I feel comfortable with. I'd be much more comfortable being loud about Sourcegraph if that wouldn't mean putting "All programmers will be replaced by AI in the next 5 years" content on my mostly language/compiler focused followers/mutuals (they know better).
Roadmap	"In the pursuit of AI-associated $$$ and growth, I think we are: 
- Doing a disservice to our existing customers who have brought us to this stage by having many important functions on life support.
- Losing differentiation
- Harming our brand (see point 1 for enterprise features) and for PLG, we say ""Unlimited Autocompletions"", but I keep hearing reports of people running into rate limiting, we've had to walk back statements related to ""Graph context"" in messaging.
- Not consistently engineering things in a way that's built to last (e.g. OpenCtx -- look at the amount of feature code vs tests -- calling some APIs is of course easy, the challenge is going to be enterprise customizations and maintenance, which makes having solid testing infrastructure vital).
"
Roadmap	we've made almost 0 strides in leveraging context as our differentiator, even though we've been talking about it for >1 year
Roadmap	From what I’ve been hearing, enthusiasm has waned largely because of our trend away from features that set us apart from the norm and toward behaviors that mimic those of other companies.
Roadmap	we don’t follow any grand plan, and even if we choose a direction, we either fail to put sufficient resources behind it, or immediately start uncoordinated pivots
Stability	I do sense frustration on shifting priorities and being asked to do lots of competing things without enough staffing from a few people.
Stability	The statement from leadership had been that we were going to do less... but it seems like we're doing more and more.
Stability	Doesn't feel like the C-suite understands how much pressure there is on everyone.
Stability	If I can quote only one thing, it would be just more stability. I wish I could be sure of not just what tomorrow is going to be about, but at least up to the next month too.
Stability	Feeling of not being able to focus on anything makes it hard to feel like he would recommend someone to work here.
Stability	The 'problem' with great engineers and ambitious people is that they want to create things that make impact which last - and here is the issue with Sourcegraph: I guess nobody can promise that the work I (or anyone) is doing now is needed in 2-3 months time, b/c the company strategy is changing so quickly.
Stability	I think the 2 major factors which play a role here, based on my own assessment and the feedback I collected from the departures in the last 6 months are: constant change and not feeling appreciated.
Stability	There’s been quite a lot of changes in the past 8 months or so. I totally understand that this is now new in the startup scene but the frequency of these changes kind of feel like we aren’t stable and anything can happen at anytime.
Stability	I would love a longer-term roadmap than just 3-6 months so that I can tell people more about our vision and a rough idea of “what they’d do in 1y from now” - are we gonna build self-driving cars, context sources, or excavators kind of level precision.
Work Environment	Negative sentiment built up from the past where a group of teammates do not care.
Work Environment	The last thing is that we should address the reason for the number of departures recently since that can give people pause in terms of recommending to work here.
Work Environment	"General economic/industry anxiety
The market is scary & Sourcegraph is small
There are some existing post-RIF scars here, and I think people still wear it on their sleeves - that can be offputting to candidates"
Work Environment	Would like a greater sense of job security. Layoffs were nearly a year ago, but still feels threatened about that. If fired tomorrow, would feel a lot less surprised than he would have a year ago.
Work Environment	Difficult to get help from other engineering teammates. 
Work Environment	Quinn's "dive bombs" into threads (actual phrasing I heard) that wreaks havoc in the priorities and force moving to a "show better light to the boss" which may not be the best course of action for the issue at hand
Work Environment	"if you're not working on something shiny, you get bad reviews
If you are not the DRI of something you don't get credit"
Work Environment	Recommending a place to work means I think they are a really good fit for some role. We’ve had a lot of team instability and last minute reassignments of new hires in the past year or so, so even if I would think person X is a great fit for “git expert on source”, I would not be certain they would actually join for that in the end, or they might be reassigned to something else within 6 months, and then the job might not necessarily match their skill set or interests anymore.

What is one thing that would make you feel more enthusiastic recommending Sourcegraph as a place to work?

TL;DR: A (clearer) product vision/direction helps us build longer plans, which reduces context-switching, which is, I believe, the main problem in Sourcegraph at the moment.

I remember when I joined Sourcegraph I was part of the Code Insights team and it was very very comfortable to work there, because
This team had a very direct and clear product vision (We probably got lucky to have Joel Kwartel as a product manager)
We (mostly our product—Joel) were doing quarter plans; we more or less understood what we would do in the next months.
Because of this we could make more visionary tech decisions. 

Comparing this with the current state, I think the biggest problem is our lack of product vision. I realised this very recently when Quinn stepped up as a product for Cody Web, and I immediately got this feeling back that we’re not just patching our product here and there, but there is a direction and plan.

It feels like Sourcegraph has become more self/eng driven, but maybe even too much. Sometimes, the engineering department might come up with some product plans, but I think it’s not healthy to have a team (like the code search team, for example) without product input at all.

I don’t believe we can replace product people with combined engs minds. It looks like our product department is too high level, maybe I think this way because code search wasn’t in the product spotlight in the past few years.

Absolutely! Some thoughts, I've actively been involved in referring/recruiting ever since I joined Sourcegraph:
I've referred multiple people to Sourcegraph in the past with @Christoph Hegemann being the last one who ended in a hire (I cold reached out to him via Twitter DM when I saw him tweeting about looking for a role).
I've tweeted a couple of times recently to advertise our upcoming openings in Cody, which resulted in me doing two casual "interviews" with potential candidates: Justin Kaeser team lead for Bazel at JetBrains - not a match for the M4 role, and Lars Kappert author of Knip (JS/TS devtooling) - could still be a strong candidate, he's looking for a new job/gig/role.

The roles we have currently have open are focused on the US, and the IC roles are very junior. My personal network is stronger in Europe and for more senior candidates (Lars is probably IC4+) so I don't think I'll be able to help out as much this round.

not feeling very enthusiastic about Sourcegraph these days

I would be more enthusiastic about Sourcegraph if we became more serious about holding a high bar for teammates. I've raised numerous performance issues in the past (directly to people, some to you, some to others) and I don't think we have yet built a strong culture around raising the bar, building high-quality products, iterating/shipping fast, etc.

One concrete example: I repeatedly raised performance concerns to @stevey about @David Veszelovszki after I took over the JetBrains project. He left the project in a terrible state and it took months to undo the damage. David got transferred to PLG, I stopped thinking about it until I saw that Teams&Invites was slipping, and seemingly for repeating the exact same mistakes David did for JetBrains (duplicating existing infrastructure). I haven't spent time digging into details because I prefer to focus on my own projects so I'm maybe reading too much between the lines. Still, David is an IC4! Meanwhile, we have IC2/IC3 teammates who are performing way better than him (for example, @Beatrix should be IC3, Philipp should have been IC4, etc.)

Other people in a similar situation include @Taylor Sperry and @Daniel Marques, although I'm more forgiving there because they are less senior than David. I have not yet seen signs that Taylor is qualified to make product decisions about IDE clients, and Daniel has still not sent a single PR to Cody (and only 4 PRs to the JB repo) despite our public job listing requiring PMs/designers to code.

RESPONSE
Overall I think we are doing a good job as a company.

One recommendation:

We do a great job of thanking and congratulating teams for shipping new features. We also track overall metrics like Daily Active Users (DAUs) for the company, as well as metrics for search and Cody (using GitDown).

To improve even further, we could start sharing and celebrating feature-level metrics. For example, if we launched a feature in February, we can look at how the usage metrics have evolved over the past few months.

(Note: This might already be happening, but I usually follow the GitDown reports and may not be aware)
