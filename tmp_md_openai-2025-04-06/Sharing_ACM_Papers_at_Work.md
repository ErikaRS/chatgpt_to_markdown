Sharing a purchased academic paper, like one from ACM, within your team generally depends on the licensing agreement or terms of use associated with the purchase. Typically, academic papers purchased individually are intended for personal use only. However, there are some scenarios to consider:

1. **Individual License**: If the paper was purchased under an individual license, it is usually not permissible to share it with others, even within the same team or company.

2. **Institutional or Corporate Subscription**: If your company holds an institutional or corporate subscription to ACM or similar databases, then sharing within the organization might be allowed under the terms of that subscription.

3. **Author's Rights**: Sometimes, authors retain the right to share their papers and may distribute them independently (like through their personal or university web pages). 

4. **Fair Use and Internal Use**: In some cases, limited sharing for educational or research purposes within an organization might be considered fair use, but this can be a legal gray area.

To be certain, you should check the specific terms of your purchase or subscription, or consult your company's legal or compliance department. Sharing copyrighted material without proper authorization could lead to legal issues for both you and your company.
