A term for the things you can't question in an organization or society is "taboo" or "sacred cow." A taboo refers to a social or cultural prohibition against discussing, questioning, or challenging certain subjects, beliefs, or practices. A sacred cow is a metaphor for an idea, custom, or institution that is considered immune from criticism or questioning due to its perceived importance or sanctity. These terms can be used to describe beliefs or practices that are seen as untouchable or beyond reproach in a particular context.
