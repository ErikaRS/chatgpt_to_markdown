While reading, try to practice the principles you learn, whether it's in a work setting, in personal projects, or even in everyday life. Leadership skills need to be exercised like a muscle.

Remember that everyone's leadership journey is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Take the advice that resonates with you, and don't be afraid to forge your own path based on your personal experiences and values.
