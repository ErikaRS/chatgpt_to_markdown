How to unclog a toilet that won't yield to a plunger

When a toilet is stubbornly clogged and the plunger isn’t cutting it, here are some increasingly forceful methods you can try, along with what’s going on behind the scenes:

---

### **1. Hot Water & Dish Soap**
**How:**  
- Pour about half a cup of dish soap into the bowl.
- Let it sit for 10–15 minutes to lubricate the blockage.
- Heat a bucket of water (not boiling—it can crack porcelain).
- Pour it from waist height into the bowl to add force.

**Why it works:**  
The soap reduces friction, and the force and heat help soften and push the clog.

---

### **2. Plumbing Snake (Toilet Auger)**
**How:**  
- Use a toilet auger (not a regular snake—it’s made for porcelain).
- Feed it into the drain, twist, and push gently to break up the clog.

**Why it works:**  
Snakes mechanically break or hook onto deep clogs that plungers can't reach.

---

### **3. Enzyme Waste Remover (for organic clogs)**
**How:**  
- Pour a septic-safe enzyme product into the bowl.
- Let it sit overnight.
- Try flushing the next day.

**Why it works:**  
These enzymes digest organic material (like waste or toilet paper), though they’re slower.

---

### **4. Wet/Dry Vacuum (Shop-Vac)**
**How:**  
- **First:** vacuum out as much water as possible.
- Create a seal with a rag and hose.
- Try to either **suck** the clog out or **blow** it through the pipes.

**Why it works:**  
The vacuum gives direct pressure control, either reversing or forcing the clog through.

---

### **5. Pull the Toilet (as a last resort)**
**How:**  
- Shut off the water and disconnect the supply line.
- Remove the bolts at the base.
- Lift the toilet and inspect or snake from below.

**Why it works:**  
If the clog is stuck in the trap built into the toilet, this is often the only fix.

---

### Reflect on This Later:
- **Which method worked, and why?**  
  Was it about breaking up material, applying pressure, or dissolving the clog?

- **How might you prevent future clogs?**  
  For example: switching to thinner toilet paper, educating household members, or scheduling pipe inspections if clogs are frequent.
