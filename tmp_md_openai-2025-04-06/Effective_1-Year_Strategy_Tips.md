What makes a good 1 year strategy statement, especially in a domain with a lot of change? 

### Assistant - 2023-12-06 09:57:09

Creating a good one-year strategy statement in a domain characterized by significant change involves several key elements:

1. **Clear and Concise**: A good strategy statement should be straightforward and easy to understand, avoiding jargon or overly complex language. It should clearly state what the organization aims to achieve within the year.

2. **Adaptability**: Given the rapid changes in the domain, the strategy should be flexible. It should allow for adjustments as new information or circumstances arise, without losing sight of the overall goal.

3. **Realistic Goals**: The objectives set in the statement should be achievable within the one-year timeframe. They should be ambitious enough to drive progress but realistic enough to be attainable.

4. **Alignment with Overall Vision and Mission**: The strategy should align with the broader vision and mission of the organization. It should be a step towards the long-term objectives, even as it focuses on the short-term.

5. **Focus on Key Areas**: Identify the most critical areas for action or improvement. In a rapidly changing environment, it's important to prioritize efforts on aspects that will have the most significant impact or that are most vulnerable to change.

6. **Measurable Objectives**: The statement should include specific, measurable objectives. This allows for tracking progress and making necessary adjustments. Metrics should be relevant and meaningful.

7. **Awareness of External Environment**: The strategy should reflect an understanding of the external environment, including market trends, technological advancements, regulatory changes, and competitor actions.

8. **Internal Capabilities and Resources**: It should consider the organization's internal capabilities and resources. This includes not only financial and physical resources but also human skills and organizational culture.

9. **Stakeholder Considerations**: The strategy should take into account the needs and expectations of key stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, and investors.

10. **Risk Management**: Address potential risks and challenges that might arise during the year. Include plans for how these will be managed or mitigated.

11. **Actionable Steps**: Finally, the statement should outline clear, actionable steps or initiatives that will be taken to achieve the objectives. This gives everyone in the organization a clear sense of direction and what is expected of them.

In summary, a good one-year strategy statement in a rapidly changing domain should be clear, adaptable, realistic, aligned with the overall mission, focused, measurable, externally aware, resource-conscious, stakeholder-inclusive, risk-aware, and action-oriented.

Given that guidance, summarize the following set of multiple attempts at strategy statements into a concise, 30 word summary:
Chris Sells Erika Rice Scherpelz Be the destination for code understanding, root cause analysis, code changes, example API usage and code-focused collaboration on the web, in the IDE and on the CLI, focusing on our differentiation from IDE-based search:
Multi-repo, multi-provider, scalable to millions of LOC
“Smart search” beyond literal and regex using our intent analysis to map formal queries, keyword searches and NLS to get to the code you need
AI-assisted workflows, e.g. code review, root cause analysis from bug reports, mass changes, etc.
(Coordinated, robust mass changes across the org’s codebase)


Our FY 2025 goal is to be the premier destination for code understanding, root cause analysis, and collaborative code changes, accessible via web, IDE, and CLI. Our unique offering includes multi-repository, multi-provider search scalable to millions of lines of code, advanced "smart search" capabilities, and AI-assisted workflows for code review, root cause analysis, and coordinated mass changes across organizational codebases.

Make Code Search pivotal
Developers adopt Code Search more readily, easier to sell
Developers who have adopted it start bringing in others into the ecosystem through link-sharing, using CS to explain code, etc. Code Search becomes an integral part of their ecosystem
Increases demand for more licenses? (View only? -> “Request full access”)
Empower the ecosystem further:
Batch Changes
API
Cody
Our FY25 strategy focuses on enhancing Search adoption among developers, becoming an essential tool within their ecosystem. By simplifying use and encouraging collaboration through link-sharing and explanatory features, we will drive widespread adoption and demand internally. Furthermore, we will empower the ecosystem with expanded features such as Batch Changes and API integrations, further solidifying Search as a critical development tool.

“Make Code Search the only place with all their code.”

Virality, lovable, collaborate
Reduce time to magic moment. Finding magic moments. We want you to learn the value quickly. Then come back because you cant get enough. 
Two sides to code search – Don’t do things that users hate. Do things that stand out as differentiated. 
Integrating Code Search and Cody to make sure users get the most from SOURCEGRAPH
By EY2024, professional developers 
Maximize touchpoints. Finding other touchpoints which make the most sense for Sourcegraph to own. 
How do I tell others about it (ex: share links)



The Search Suite is THE starting place for developer work. 

lovability to bring the virality coefficient above one, integrate our differentiated features into every step of the dev workflow. We will lean on Sourcegraph’s differentiators by easily indexing ALL of a company’s code.
