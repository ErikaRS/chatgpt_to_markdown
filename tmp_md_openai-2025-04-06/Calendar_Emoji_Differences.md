Why are there two standard calendar emoji with dates? These ones: 📅 📆 And what are their names?

The two standard calendar emoji represent different types of calendars:

1. **📅 (Calendar Emoji)** - This emoji is generally referred to simply as "Calendar." It depicts a single-page calendar or wall calendar with a specific date visible. This one often symbolizes events, dates, or planning, and the visible date may vary by platform.

2. **📆 (Tear-Off Calendar Emoji)** - This one is called "Tear-Off Calendar." It represents a day-specific, tearable desk or wall calendar, also showing a specific date. The idea of this emoji is more about a daily calendar that you would tear off each day to reveal the next.

The visible dates on both emojis may vary by platform, and sometimes have historical or special significance. For example, many versions show **July 17**—which is famously known as "World Emoji Day" (because that’s the date shown on Apple's calendar emoji).

The distinction between these two emojis is in their style: the **📅 Calendar** represents a monthly planner, while the **📆 Tear-Off Calendar** symbolizes a more casual, day-to-day approach to tracking dates.

By why? Why out of all the emoji to add two minor variations of, did they choose the calendar?

That's a great question! The decision to include both types of calendar emoji might seem odd, especially given the many other objects or concepts that only have a single representation or none at all. There are a few reasons why these two calendar emojis exist:

1. **Historical Origins**: Unicode, which standardizes emoji, often draws inspiration from pre-existing pictographic conventions. The **📅 Calendar** and **📆 Tear-Off Calendar** are inspired by two different styles of physical calendars that have distinct uses. The tear-off calendar, for instance, was a familiar office or household item, commonly seen on desks or walls. Including both may have been about capturing different types of widely recognized calendar forms that serve different purposes.

2. **Platform Representation**: When emoji were first being introduced, major tech platforms like Apple, Google, and Microsoft aimed to cover as many practical communication symbols as possible, often considering different cultural and usage contexts. Calendars are widely recognized, universally useful symbols, and including more than one variation allows emoji to cover different nuances of time management—like a monthly planner versus a daily agenda.

3. **Cultural Context**: In Japan, where emoji originated, day-to-day tear-off calendars are quite common, and they’re often part of traditional daily rituals. The **📆 Tear-Off Calendar** can evoke that culturally significant daily marking, whereas the **📅 Calendar** feels more like a broader monthly view. When emoji became popular globally, it made sense to keep both forms that were familiar to Japanese users and may also be recognizable across other regions.

4. **Early Unicode Sets**: Emoji were originally designed with sets that conveyed different variations on a theme to ensure coverage across many potential situations. This is why you have other minor variations like **🗓️ Spiral Calendar** or **🗒️ Spiral Notepad**—they’re essentially attempts to fill out a complete toolkit for communication. The decision may have been less about the importance of calendars themselves and more about ensuring the range of objects available felt complete to users.

5. **Practical Use Cases**: The inclusion of both types can also come down to different practical uses in digital communication. The **📅 Calendar** can imply a planned event or a specific date on a broader monthly scope, while the **📆 Tear-Off Calendar** might be used to imply urgency or focus on today’s date. This nuance gives people more expressive options when talking about time.

In short, while it might seem odd that there are two variations of such a specific object, it comes down to Unicode's desire to reflect different real-world objects that serve related but slightly different purposes—and to give people more nuanced ways to communicate dates, plans, or time-related topics. It's a reflection of emoji's origins and the cultural context in which they developed.
