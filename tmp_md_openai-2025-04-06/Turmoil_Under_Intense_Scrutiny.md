But what is the phrase "too many ? in the fire"?

Ah, you're referring to the phrase "too many irons in the fire." This idiom means being involved in too many activities or projects at the same time, often to the detriment of one's ability to manage them effectively. It suggests a situation where someone is overextended or at risk of failing because they are trying to do too much at once.
