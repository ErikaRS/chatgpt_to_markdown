If I wanted to update the term "mythical man-month" to something less gender specific and which reflects the faster pace of modern development, what would be a good choice for "something" in "something dev-days"?

A suitable term for "something" in "something dev-days" that is less gender-specific and reflects the faster pace of modern development could be "Agile."

That's not quite what I meant. What I want to retain is the idea from the concept of the mythical man-month that a man-month is a myth because people are not fungible and communication is not scalable. But I want to update the unit of measurement from "man-month" to "dev-days" while retaining the catchy pithiness of the original.

### Assistant - 2023-04-28 11:07:11

I understand now. To retain the concept of the mythical man-month while using the "dev-days" unit and ensuring it remains catchy and gender-neutral, you could use the term "Illusory Dev-Days." This term captures the idea that simply adding more developers to a project won't necessarily speed up development, as communication and collaboration complexities increase.

How does "deceptive dev-days" compare in catchiness to "illusory dev-days"? How does "delusive dev-days" compare? My feeling is that "delusive" sounds best but is too obscure a word. 

### Assistant - 2023-04-28 11:09:07

Both "deceptive dev-days" and "delusive dev-days" have a certain catchiness to them, but they convey slightly different nuances. "Deceptive dev-days" implies that the concept might be intentionally misleading, while "delusive dev-days" suggests that the notion is simply misleading or false without necessarily implying intention.

As for obscurity, "delusive" is indeed a less commonly used word than "deceptive." However, its rarity might actually make it more memorable, as it adds an element of curiosity or intrigue. If you're looking for the catchiest option and are not too concerned about obscurity, "delusive dev-days" might be the better choice. But if you prefer a more familiar term, "deceptive dev-days" would be suitable as well.

How do either compare to "illusory dev-days" on catchiness?

### Assistant - 2023-04-28 11:09:37

Comparing the catchiness of "illusory dev-days," "deceptive dev-days," and "delusive dev-days" ultimately comes down to personal preference and the specific context in which the phrase will be used. 

"Illusory dev-days" has a slightly more sophisticated and mysterious tone, while "deceptive dev-days" and "delusive dev-days" convey a more direct sense of something being misleading or false. In terms of catchiness, "illusory dev-days" might stand out due to its more unique and intriguing quality. However, "deceptive dev-days" and "delusive dev-days" are also catchy in their own right.

It's important to consider your target audience and the message you want to convey when choosing between these options. All three phrases have their own appeal, and any one of them could work well depending on your goals and context.
