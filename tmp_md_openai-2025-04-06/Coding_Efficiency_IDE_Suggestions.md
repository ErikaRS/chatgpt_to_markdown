Cluster these user stories (sometimes with potential solutions) based on the software development lifecycle:
As a junior developer, I want to be able to understand why certain code examples are better than others so that I can strengthen my development skills more quickly as I do my day-to-day work. (IDE)
As an (IC) pro developer, I want to be able to search my codebase to understand how to execute on my task (aka should be in the IDE)
As an (IC) pro developer onboarding onto a new codebase, I want to be able to get up to speed quickly on that codebase so that I can execute on a task quickly
As a developer I want to know how well aligned is the code I review with the company standards because then we don’t have to refactor the code later.
As a designer, I want to be able to find and navigate the code of a build on Web to better collaborate with my dev counterpart
As a developer, I want to share relevant information with people I am collaborating with so that they can get answers to their questions. 
As a developer, I want to be able to share a piece of code with a teammate to get their perspective on what this code does
As a developer, I want to understand what has changed in an area so that I can keep my knowledge of the code up to date. 
Potential how: In my IDE, I want to be able to get an overview summary of what has changed relative to what I care about. (i.e., I don’t want to see every single CL and I don’t need detail about areas that I never work with).

As a (more senior) pro developer, I want to be able to can through my codebase at a high level to understand how the codebase is evolving  (aka should be in the Web)
As a (more senior) pro developer, I want to be able to can through my codebase at a high level to understand if a engineering coding pattern is being followed (aka should be in the Web)
As a developer, I want to identify areas of code that get a lot of bugs so that I can add additional testing. 
As a developer, I want to find code that helps me quickly build a prototype so that I can determine the feasibility of an idea. 
As a developer, I want to know who is the owner of the code that I found so that I can reach out and ask them questions.
As a security engineer, I want to understand where we are at risk for some vulnerability so that I can assess and reduce our risk profile. 
Potential how: On the web, I would like to see a list of starting points of higher risk areas for further investigation. I would further like to be able to manually refine and supplement that through search.


As a developer, I want to understand what design docs, monitoring, logs, design files relate to this code so I can understand the broader context in which the code exists.
Potential how: In the IDE, annotate code with links to relevant stuff. 
As a developer I want to identity bad patterns/security vulnerabilities in the code before I copy paste for a new feature
As a manager, I want to understand overall productivity and quality so that I can understand how to help my team be more effective.  
Potential how: On the web, I would like to see both pre-defined and custom defined views of key metrics and aggregations. 
As a developer, I want to understand what code my change will break so I can preemptively fix issues. 
Potential how: In my IDE (because that’s where my not-yet-checked-in-changes are), I want to get a list of areas impacted by my change ranked by risk and with an explanation of why they are risky.
Why enterprise? Depends on whole code base to really be complete.

To cluster these user stories based on the software development lifecycle (SDLC) phases, it's helpful to first outline the typical phases of SDLC:

1. **Planning**: Includes requirements gathering and defining the scope of the project.
2. **Analysis and Design**: Involves analyzing requirements and designing the system architecture.
3. **Implementation (Coding)**: The actual coding/programming phase.
4. **Testing**: Involves the testing of created software.
5. **Deployment**: The phase where the software is made available for use.
6. **Maintenance**: Includes updates, refinements, bug fixing, and optimizations post-deployment.
