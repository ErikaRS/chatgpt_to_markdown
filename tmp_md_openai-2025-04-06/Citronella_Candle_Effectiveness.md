Citronella candles are primarily effective against mosquitoes, but their impact on other bugs is limited. The scent of citronella can deter some insects like flies to a certain extent, but it’s not reliable for keeping all types of bugs away. The effectiveness of citronella candles also depends on factors like wind, the concentration of citronella, and the proximity of the candle to where you need protection. For broader insect control, additional repellents or strategies might be necessary.

Why do children get more wound up as it gets later in the evening?

Children often become more wound up as it gets later in the evening due to a combination of factors related to their natural rhythms, overstimulation, and overtiredness:

1. **Overtiredness**: As kids become increasingly tired, their bodies can paradoxically respond by producing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can give them a sudden burst of energy, making them hyperactive or wound up, even when they’re actually very tired.

2. **Overstimulation**: Activities throughout the day, such as playtime, screen time, or excitement before bed, can overstimulate their minds and bodies. As bedtime approaches, this built-up stimulation may show up as restlessness or hyperactivity.

3. **Circadian Rhythms**: As bedtime nears, their natural circadian rhythms signal it’s time to wind down. However, if the environment or activities don’t align with this, the body may try to compensate by staying active, leading to a second wind.

4. **Routine Changes**: Inconsistent bedtime routines or extended wakefulness beyond their usual schedule can throw off their internal clock. When kids stay up later than usual, they may become wired as they struggle against their body’s natural signals.

5. **Social or Environmental Cues**: The presence of other people, especially if there’s ongoing activity or interaction, can make children more excited or energized. They may pick up on the cues that it’s still “playtime” rather than bedtime.

A consistent bedtime routine and a calming environment can help mitigate these late-evening bursts of energy.
