What is a  more general time for someone who coaches or mentors? In business contexts, coaches generally use active listening and questioning to help people solve their own problems. Mentors share their own experience as it relates to the mentee's challenges. However, there's a more holistic version where someone coaches and mentors and also evaluates. What might one call that person?

A person who combines the roles of coaching, mentoring, and evaluating in a business context is often referred to as a "Consultant" or an "Advisor." These terms encompass the guidance and expertise of mentoring, the problem-solving and empowerment approach of coaching, and the evaluative insights that come with assessing performance or strategies. Additionally, the term "Executive Coach" might also be used, especially if this individual works with high-level management, blending coaching with strategic advice and performance evaluation. Another term could be "Development Coach," indicating a focus on both personal and professional development, including evaluation. These roles emphasize a holistic approach to professional development, blending various methods to enhance an individual's performance and decision-making skills in a business environment.
