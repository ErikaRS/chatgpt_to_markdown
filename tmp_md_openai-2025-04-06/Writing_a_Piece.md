Here is the current draft:
# **Leading high-performing engineering teams at Sourcegraph**

At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time… and it feels like everything needed to be done yesterday. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, prioritize effectively, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed.

### **Ineffective managers: fixers vs. phantoms**

Ineffective managers fall into two categories: **fixers** or **phantoms**.

The **fixer** jumps in at every issue, giving step-by-step instructions and solving problems themselves. This undermines autonomy, leaving engineers dependent and stifling creativity.

The **phantom** assumes autonomy means hands-off management, offering little guidance. While the team may have freedom, they risk misalignment and wasted effort without clear direction.

Both approaches hinder high agency: fixers smother it, while phantoms let it run without guidance.

### **The impactful manager: coach, not hero**

Impactful managers act as **coaches**, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute.

### **1\. Deliver business needs**

Impactful managers understand that engineering doesn’t exist in a bubble. They focus on outcomes that benefit the business. They foster shared responsibility across teams, ensuring cross-team and cross-functional alignment. They collaborate closely with Product, Design, TPM, Technical Success, and Marketing to meet the broader needs of the business. Their job is to ensure the right stakeholders are involved at the right time and to balance competing demands in a way that maximizes impact across the company.

One of the biggest challenges we face is balancing customer-specific work and escalations with work that benefits the broader user base. Customer requests can be urgent and critical for business success, but the long-term health of the product depends on improvements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this balance, pushing back if customer requests are impeding their ability to progress on other work.

When cross-functional partners such as Product or Design are unavailable, impactful managers advocate for those perspectives, making decisions that reflect the business as a whole. This helps ensure that engineering efforts are always aligned with larger priorities.

Techniques for this:

* **Cross-functional meetings** to ensure alignment with stakeholders.  
* **Clear prioritization** to weigh customer-specific work against broader product goals.  
* **Acting as an advocate** for stakeholders, ensuring decisions reflect the full company perspective.

Ineffective managers either prioritize short-term customer work to the detriment of the broader product or overlook customer needs, causing friction between teams.

### **2\. Prioritize and push for delivery**

At Sourcegraph, starting work is easy... but finishing is what delivers value. Impactful managers are hands-on, working alongside their teams when needed, whether by participating in coding or providing direct feedback. They ensure teams prioritize tasks that deliver the most value to customers and the business. Every engineer should understand how their work moves the business and the developer experience forward.

Techniques for this:

* **Prioritization** of projects in Linear, getting stakeholder input and escalating decisions when needed.  
* **Timeboxing** work to focus on deliverables.  
* **Regular check-ins** to ensure alignment on goals and progress on top priorities.

Ineffective managers either allow the team to spread too thin or fail to prioritize, leading to activity without output.

### **3\. Cultivate high agency**

Impactful managers build autonomy by **asking the right questions** rather than providing all the answers. They foster an environment where engineers are expected to act fast, take ownership, and make decisions. The expectation is not to wait for explicit approval, but to act in the best interest of developers and the business. When engineers face challenges, impactful managers guide them to think through solutions, helping them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.

Techniques for this:

* **One-on-one coaching** to help engineers think critically.  
* **Socratic questioning** to guide engineers to solutions.  
* **Feedback on RFCs and project overviews** to help engineers outline their thought process.

Ineffective managers either solve problems themselves or fail to address them, preventing engineers from growing their autonomy.

### **4\. Create conditions for effective execution**

Impactful managers set **clear goals** aligned with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. Everything we do is for developers, and every effort is aimed at delivering results that make a tangible impact. Projects should be well scoped and defined, giving teams clarity and purpose without micromanagement.

Impactful managers enable alignment and accountability by **promoting transparency** within their teams and across the entire organization. They create a culture where honest feedback is encouraged, allowing teams to learn quickly from both successes and failures. 

Impactful managers **trust their engineers to execute** once the goals are clear. They expect engineers to take responsibility for delivering results, while maintaining transparency in how progress is communicated. When roles and responsibilities are clearly assigned, teams can work autonomously while staying connected to the broader vision.

**Techniques for this:**

* **Project scoping** should target clear definitions and alignment with goals.  
* **Kickoff meetings** should define objectives, set expectations, and assign clear roles.  
* **Transparent communication** provides open information flow and regular feedback.  
* **Clear roles and responsibilities** enable alignment while preserving autonomy.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving teams without a clear sense of purpose. Without transparency and clear guidance, teams lose focus and momentum, ultimately affecting the impact of their work.

### **5\. Balance speed and stability**

Speed is critical at Sourcegraph, but not just speed in the present. True velocity pairs fast execution with solutions that enable greater velocity in the future. Impactful managers ensure engineers build solutions that meet today’s needs without over-engineering for tomorrow. Things move quickly in our space, and we’re better served by simple, robust, and easy-to-modify code than by overgeneralized systems. This doesn’t mean cutting corners, but it does mean solving today’s problems without overbuilding.

Impactful managers ensure that speed remains sustainable. Fast delivery only works if it doesn’t accumulate too much technical debt that will slow the team down later. Engineers are expected to take ownership of their code’s quality—delivering quickly *and* ensuring the codebase remains scalable.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to velocity investments—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. (Testing and documentation are always required.) This approach reduces technical debt build up. Additionally, impactful managers identify code hotspots that slow development and prioritize cleanup projects to address them.

Techniques for this:

* **Schedule planning** that accounts for 25% of time for velocity improvements.  
* **Tracking hotspots** in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.

Ineffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term stability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt. Or they allow their teams to build overengineered designs that are hard to modify as requirements change. Both these create teams that execute slowly.

### **6\. Celebrate wins and build resilience**

Impactful managers celebrate wins and frame failures as opportunities to drive future success. They celebrate wins, big or small. They frame failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.

Techniques for this:

* **Demo days and company demos** to showcase achievements and celebrate progress.  
* **Retrospectives** to learn from mistakes (and successes\!)  without assigning blame.  
* **Public recognition** (e.g., in \#thanks and \#progress) to reinforce team successes and build momentum.

Ineffective managers either ignore achievements or punish failure, creating a culture of fear rather than innovation.

### **Conclusion: nurture high-performing teams**

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers empower their teams to focus on what matters, take action, and deliver real value to customers and the business. They create an environment where autonomy thrives, accountability is embraced, and every challenge is an opportunity to learn and improve.

Integrate a management angle on this comment into "1. Deliver business needs"

The ideal zone is where a dev on our team understands what the customer needs AND feels the need on their own as well, so that they can execute tons of fast feedback loops in their head as they build. Devs can do this when building for devs because they can gain a higher-fidelity understanding of what the customer's problem is (vs. if they were building for, say, doctors).

Our devs should try to get into this zone as much as possible. Anything outside this zone is like 1/10th as productive and fun.

I tried to integrate your comment into the "1. Deliver business needs" section a couple of times, but it seems there are still issues matching the document formatting.

Modify the text around "providing direct feedback" to address this point

There are times when managers should be providing answers, where providing these answers clearly and quickly actually creates clarity on what needs to be done, rather than let the team stumble about trying to find answers to questions that already have answers. Managers need the trust of the team to do this effectively. When a major competitor releases a directly competitive feature and we need to react quickly, we don't have time to conduct the Socratic method for every member of the eng team.

Add a third bullet point to "ineffective managers", which is the manager who coddles their team and doesn't actually deliver on business results, the manager who can't call bullshit because they are entirely reliant on secondhand information to make important decisions, and the manager who can't roll up their sleeves and get into the actual code when a disagreement needs to be sorted through.

### Assistant - 2024-10-06 16:29:29

Here are five alternative names for "cultivator" that sound a bit more negative and, where possible, start with "f" or "ph":

1. **Facade Manager** - They appear supportive, but lack the substance to deliver real results.
2. **Flatterer** - They focus on keeping everyone happy rather than delivering business value.
3. **Fumbler** - They drop the ball on delivering outcomes, causing confusion and delays.
4. **Phony** - They rely on secondhand information and fail to engage deeply enough to make real decisions.
5. **Feigner** - They pretend to be hands-on but ultimately avoid the hard work needed to resolve issues.

Do any of these resonate with you, or would you like me to refine these further?

Suggest 10 other names for the cultivator section, preferably ones that start with "ph" or "f" 

### Assistant - 2024-10-06 16:32:56

Here are ten alternative names for the "cultivator" section, with a preference for names that start with "ph" or "f":

1. **Facade Manager** - They appear supportive but lack substance in delivering real results.
2. **Feigner** - They pretend to be effective, but don't actually deliver meaningful outcomes.
3. **Fumbler** - They fail to take decisive action, leading to team underperformance.
4. **Flatterer** - They prioritize keeping everyone happy instead of pushing for results.
5. **Phony** - They project an image of competence without the skills to back it up.
6. **Follower** - They lack initiative, merely echoing others' decisions without adding value.
7. **Fogger** - They obscure issues, preventing the team from facing hard truths and making progress.
8. **Floater** - They drift without making tough decisions, causing the team to stagnate.
9. **Facade Feeder** - They build superficial confidence in their team but avoid actual accountability.
10. **Falterer** - They hesitate and fail to step up when leadership is most needed.

Do any of these resonate with you, or would you like me to refine these further?

We strive for simple, robust, and easy-to-modify code, which allows us to move quickly without compromising quality. This means addressing today’s problems efficiently, without overbuilding or accumulating technical debt.\n\nImpactful managers hold a high bar for both speed and stability, recognizing that sustainable speed is achieved through maintaining quality. Engineers are expected to take ownership of their code’s quality—delivering quickly while ensuring the codebase remains scalable and maintainable.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to velocity investments—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring.

Impactful managers ensure engineering delivers outcomes that benefit the business. They foster shared responsibility and cross-functional alignment, collaborating with stakeholders like Product, Design, and Marketing. Their role includes balancing competing demands to maximize impact and ensuring that the right stakeholders are involved at the right time.

Impactful managers also make sure developers understand and feel customer needs, enabling them to iterate quickly through internalized feedback loops. This helps them make rapid, informed decisions to build impactful solutions.

A key challenge is balancing customer-specific work with broader improvements. Customer requests can be urgent, but the product's long-term health depends on enhancements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this balance, pushing back when necessary.

When cross-functional partners are unavailable, impactful managers advocate for those perspectives, making decisions that reflect the business as a whole and ensuring alignment with larger priorities.

Impactful managers also ensure that developers understand customer needs and feel these needs on their own. This enables them to iterate quickly, as they have internalized feedback loops that allow them to make rapid and informed decisions while building impactful solutions.

One of the biggest challenges we face is balancing customer-specific work and escalations with work that benefits the broader user base. Customer requests can be urgent and critical for business success, but the long-term health of the product depends on improvements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this balance, pushing back if customer requests are impeding their ability to progress on other work.

  "content": "# **Leading high-performing engineering teams at Sourcegraph**\n\nAt Sourcegraph, there\u2019s always more work than time\u2026 and it feels like everything needed to be done yesterday. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, prioritize effectively, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed.\n\n### **Ineffective managers: fixers, phantoms, and friends**\n\nIneffective managers fall into two categories: **fixers** or **phantoms**.\n\nThe **fixer** jumps in at every issue, giving step-by-step instructions and solving problems themselves. This undermines autonomy, leaves engineers dependent, and stifles creativity. Fixers struggle to delegate and fail to develop their team's skills, ultimately slowing the team down.\n\nThe **phantom** assumes autonomy means hands-off management, offering little guidance. They avoid involvement, leaving the team without direction or support. This often leads to misalignment, wasted effort, and poor outcomes due to a lack of oversight and structure.\n\nThe **friend** coddles their team, fails to deliver results, and cannot effectively challenge ideas. They rely on secondhand information and avoid getting into the code when needed, which causes drag and divides the team from the company.\n\nAll three approaches hinder high agency: fixers smother it, phantoms let it run without guidance, and friends decouple it from meaningful results.\n\n### **The impactful manager: coach, not hero**\n\nImpactful managers act as **coaches**, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute. However, impactful managers also ensure accountability by setting clear expectations, monitoring progress, and doing their part to keep projects on track. They balance empowerment with hands-on involvement to ensure that delivery standards and deadlines are consistently met.\n\n### **1. Deliver business needs**\n\nImpactful managers ensure engineering delivers outcomes that benefit the business. They make sure developers don't just understand customer needs. They feel them. This enables devs to iterate quickly toward high quality solutions through **internalized feedback loops**.\n\nImpactful managers understand that engineering doesn\u2019t exist in a bubble. They ensure **cross-team and cross-functional alignment**, collaborating closely with Product, Design, TPM, Technical Success, and Marketing. When cross-functional partners such as Product or Design are unavailable, impactful managers **advocate for those perspectives**, making decisions that reflect the business as a whole. This helps ensure that engineering efforts are always aligned with larger priorities.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we face is balancing customer-specific work with work that benefits the broader user base. Customer requests can be urgent and critical for business success, but the long-term health of the product depends on improvements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this **balance**, pushing back if customer requests are impeding their ability to progress on other work. \n\n**Techniques for this:**\n\n- **Encourage internalized feedback loops** by ensuring developers use our products in their work and directly watch/read/gather customer feedback.\n- **Cross-functional meetings** to ensure alignment with stakeholders.\n- **Clear prioritization** to weigh customer-specific work against broader product goals.\n- **Acting as an advocate** for stakeholders, ensuring decisions reflect the full company perspective.\n\nIneffective managers either prioritize short-term customer work to the detriment of the broader product or overlook customer needs, causing friction between teams.\n\n### **2. Prioritize and push for delivery**\n\nAt Sourcegraph, starting work is easy... but finishing is what delivers value. Impactful managers are hands-on, working alongside their teams when needed, whether by participating in coding and design or providing direct answers when the team needs clarity on next steps. They ensure teams prioritize tasks that deliver the most value to customers and the business. Every engineer should understand how their work moves the business and the developer experience forward.\n\n**Techniques for this:**\n\n- **Prioritization** of projects in Linear, getting stakeholder input and escalating decisions when needed.\n- **Timeboxing** work to focus on deliverables.\n- **Regular check-ins** to ensure alignment on goals and progress on top priorities.\n\nIneffective managers either allow the team to spread too thin or fail to prioritize, leading to activity without output.\n\n### **3. Cultivate high agency**\n\nImpactful managers build autonomy by **asking the right questions** rather than providing all the answers. However, there are times when providing answers directly is crucial, especially when clarity is needed quickly. This helps avoid unnecessary delays when the path forward is already known, such as when reacting to competitive pressures. Impactful managers balance fostering autonomy with providing guidance as needed, ensuring that engineers are expected to act fast, take ownership, and make decisions in the best interest of developers and the business. When engineers face challenges, impactful managers guide them to think through solutions, helping them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.\n\n**Techniques for this:**\n\n- **One-on-one coaching** to help engineers think critically.\n- **Socratic questioning** to guide engineers to solutions.\n- **Feedback on RFCs and project overviews** to help engineers outline their thought process.\n\nIneffective managers either solve problems themselves or fail to address them, preventing engineers from growing their autonomy.\n\n### **4. Create conditions for effective execution**\n\nImpactful managers set **clear goals** aligned with Sourcegraph\u2019s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers.

Leading high-performing engineering teams at Sourcegraph
At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time… and it feels like everything needed to be done yesterday. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, prioritize effectively, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed.
Ineffective managers: fixers vs. phantoms
Ineffective managers fall into two categories: fixers or phantoms.
The fixer jumps in at every issue, giving step-by-step instructions and solving problems themselves. This undermines autonomy, leaving engineers dependent and stifling creativity.
The phantom assumes autonomy means hands-off management, offering little guidance. While the team may have freedom, they risk misalignment and wasted effort without clear direction.
Both approaches hinder high agency: fixers smother it, while phantoms let it run without guidance.
The impactful manager: coach, not hero
Impactful managers act as coaches, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute.
1. Deliver business needs
Impactful managers understand that engineering doesn’t exist in a bubble. They focus on outcomes that benefit the business. They foster shared responsibility across teams, ensuring cross-team and cross-functional alignment. They collaborate closely with Product, Design, TPM, Technical Success, and Marketing to meet the broader needs of the business. Their job is to ensure the right stakeholders are involved at the right time and to balance competing demands in a way that maximizes impact across the company.
One of the biggest challenges we face is balancing customer-specific work and escalations with work that benefits the broader user base. Customer requests can be urgent and critical for business success, but the long-term health of the product depends on improvements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this balance, pushing back if customer requests are impeding their ability to progress on other work.
When cross-functional partners such as Product or Design are unavailable, impactful managers advocate for those perspectives, making decisions that reflect the business as a whole. This helps ensure that engineering efforts are always aligned with larger priorities.
Techniques for this:
Cross-functional meetings to ensure alignment with stakeholders.
Clear prioritization to weigh customer-specific work against broader product goals.
Acting as an advocate for stakeholders, ensuring decisions reflect the full company perspective.
Ineffective managers either prioritize short-term customer work to the detriment of the broader product or overlook customer needs, causing friction between teams.
2. Prioritize and push for delivery
At Sourcegraph, starting work is easy... but finishing is what delivers value. Impactful managers are hands-on, working alongside their teams when needed, whether by participating in coding or providing direct feedback. They ensure teams prioritize tasks that deliver the most value to customers and the business. Every engineer should understand how their work moves the business and the developer experience forward.
Techniques for this:
Prioritization of projects in Linear, getting stakeholder input and escalating decisions when needed.
Timeboxing work to focus on deliverables.
Regular check-ins to ensure alignment on goals and progress on top priorities.
Ineffective managers either allow the team to spread too thin or fail to prioritize, leading to activity without output.
3. Cultivate high agency
Impactful managers build autonomy by asking the right questions rather than providing all the answers. They foster an environment where engineers are expected to act fast, take ownership, and make decisions. The expectation is not to wait for explicit approval, but to act in the best interest of developers and the business. When engineers face challenges, impactful managers guide them to think through solutions, helping them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.
Techniques for this:
One-on-one coaching to help engineers think critically.
Socratic questioning to guide engineers to solutions.
Feedback on RFCs and project overviews to help engineers outline their thought process.
Ineffective managers either solve problems themselves or fail to address them, preventing engineers from growing their autonomy.
4. Create conditions for effective execution
Impactful managers set clear goals aligned with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. Everything we do is for developers, and every effort is aimed at delivering results that make a tangible impact. Projects should be well scoped and defined, giving teams clarity and purpose without micromanagement.
Impactful managers enable alignment and accountability by promoting transparency within their teams and across the entire organization. They create a culture where honest feedback is encouraged, allowing teams to learn quickly from both successes and failures. 
Impactful managers trust their engineers to execute once the goals are clear. They expect engineers to take responsibility for delivering results, while maintaining transparency in how progress is communicated. When roles and responsibilities are clearly assigned, teams can work autonomously while staying connected to the broader vision.
Techniques for this:
Project scoping should target clear definitions and alignment with goals.
Kickoff meetings should define objectives, set expectations, and assign clear roles.
Transparent communication provides open information flow and regular feedback.
Clear roles and responsibilities enable alignment while preserving autonomy.
Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving teams without a clear sense of purpose. Without transparency and clear guidance, teams lose focus and momentum, ultimately affecting the impact of their work.
5. Balance speed and stability
Speed is critical at Sourcegraph, but not just speed in the present. True velocity pairs fast execution with solutions that enable greater velocity in the future. Impactful managers ensure engineers build solutions that meet today’s needs without over-engineering for tomorrow. Things move quickly in our space, and we’re better served by simple, robust, and easy-to-modify code than by overgeneralized systems. This doesn’t mean cutting corners, but it does mean solving today’s problems without overbuilding.
Impactful managers ensure that speed remains sustainable. Fast delivery only works if it doesn’t accumulate too much technical debt that will slow the team down later. Engineers are expected to take ownership of their code’s quality—delivering quickly and ensuring the codebase remains scalable.
A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to velocity investments—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. (Testing and documentation are always required.) This approach reduces technical debt build up. Additionally, impactful managers identify code hotspots that slow development and prioritize cleanup projects to address them.
Techniques for this:
Schedule planning that accounts for 25% of time for velocity improvements.
Tracking hotspots in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.
Ineffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term stability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt. Or they allow their teams to build overengineered designs that are hard to modify as requirements change. Both these create teams that execute slowly.
6. Celebrate wins and build resilience
Impactful managers celebrate wins and frame failures as opportunities to drive future success. They celebrate wins, big or small. They frame failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.
Techniques for this:
Demo days and company demos to showcase achievements and celebrate progress.
Retrospectives to learn from mistakes (and successes!)  without assigning blame.
Public recognition (e.g., in #thanks and #progress) to reinforce team successes and build momentum.
Ineffective managers either ignore achievements or punish failure, creating a culture of fear rather than innovation.
Conclusion: nurture high-performing teams
At Sourcegraph, impactful managers empower their teams to focus on what matters, take action, and deliver real value to customers and the business. They create an environment where autonomy thrives, accountability is embraced, and every challenge is an opportunity to learn and improve.

Here is the diff between the new and current versions of the document, focusing only on content changes and ignoring formatting:

1. **Title and Introduction**
   - The title remains the same.
   - Introduction is unchanged.

2. **Ineffective Managers:**
   - Changed section title from "fixers vs. phantoms" to "fixers, phantoms, and friends."
   - Added **friend** as a third type of ineffective manager:
     - The **friend** coddles their team, fails to deliver results, and cannot effectively challenge ideas. They rely on secondhand information and avoid getting into the code when needed, which causes drag and divides the team from the company.

3. **Impactful Manager:**
   - Added more detail about impactful managers ensuring accountability: "They balance empowerment with hands-on involvement to ensure that delivery standards and deadlines are consistently met."

4. **Deliver Business Needs:**
   - Added emphasis on developers internalizing customer needs: "They make sure developers don't just understand customer needs. They feel them. This enables devs to iterate quickly toward high quality solutions through **internalized feedback loops**."
   - Modified balance section to emphasize pushing back if customer requests are impeding progress on other work.

5. **Techniques for Delivering Business Needs:**
   - Added a technique: "**Encourage internalized feedback loops** by ensuring developers use our products in their work and directly watch/read/gather customer feedback."

6. **Prioritize and Push for Delivery:**
   - No significant changes to the core content.

7. **Cultivate High Agency:**
   - Emphasized that there are times when providing direct answers is crucial, particularly in competitive situations.

8. **Create Conditions for Effective Execution:**
   - Added the concept of developers getting "into the zone" by internalizing feedback loops: "This state allows them to make rapid, informed decisions that boost productivity and enjoyment. Anything outside this zone is significantly less productive and less enjoyable."

9. **Balance Speed and Stability:**
   - Updated to emphasize that speed and stability are complementary: "Speed and stability are not at odds; they often go hand in hand."
   - Removed some redundancy related to setting a high bar for both speed and stability.
   - Added a rule of thumb: allocate 25% of project time to velocity improvements.

10. **Assess Team Performance:**
    - Moved the "Assess team performance" section before "Create conditions for effective execution."
    - Focused on identifying team members as **bullets** (task executors) and **barrels** (project owners).

11. **Conclusion:**
    - Unchanged from the current version.
