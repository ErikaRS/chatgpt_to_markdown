Eng-Product-Design decision log for the last month

# Week of 9 Dec 2024

## Cody Core EM (@Grace Shih) will make product decisions for IDE extensions

---

### What?

@Kalan Chan has been acting as interim PM for the Cody IDE extensions. Going forward, @Grace Shih (Cody Core EM) will take that on.

### Why?

This will give @Kalan Chan more bandwidth for one box, a complex cross-team, cross-functional initiative that needs his attention. As for why @Grace Shih, 

- For Visual Studio and Eclipse, the decision is mostly "how much parity when" which is mostly a staffing question, which you own.
- For VS Code and JetBrains, the decisions are either linked to other projects (e.g., one box or teams) or they're primarily technical in scope

Both of these sets of decisions are well scoped to be handled within the Cody Core team.

## Fastpath for Autocomplete is not a  blocker for Multi-tenant for Jan 29th release (change to previous decision)

---

### What?

On [Jan 29th](https://www.notion.so/Exec-team-decision-log-433eb6df050e464098d1ab28b64652db?pvs=21) we will launch multi-tenant, which will move Pro users to a more Enterprise-like architecture, which will remove the “fastpath” where autocomplete requests go directly to the Gateway instead of through the SG instance. As a consequence, we will likely expect to see an increase in autocomplete latency for a subset of users (we believe non-US users to be most affected by this change) 

### Why?

The benefits of the Multi-tenant should outweigh the slight regression in autocomplete experience, and we will complete the investigation on what can be done to improve autocomplete for such setups, including Enterprises, and prioritize that effect accordingly to other product priorities

## We are committing to building autocomplete for Visual Studios  and will try to bundle it as part of the GA launch (change to previous decision)

DRI: @Kalan Chan 

### What?

Disclaimer: Visual Studio GA is not dependent on autocomplete, the primary focus will be a stable client and high quality chat. 

The Visual Studio team will aim to get autocomplete shipped as an experimental feature by end of December 2024 for customers to try. We will try to bundle autocomplete as stable feature with Visual Studio GA by FY2025 Q4 (best estimate). 

The date for Visual Studio GA is not concrete, it really depends how busy we are with the one box and MTSG launch on 1/29 but we will commit to GA somewhere in that time frame. The team feels confident about timelines, so we will try and bundle it all together to distribute it in one launch.

### Why?

Autocomplete is a must have feature for us to compete with Copilot, but it is not higher priority than providing our customers with a high quality and stable product. The Visual Studio team is committed to shipping autocomplete to unlock expansion opportunities with multiple interested customers (ex - Bet365, Keysight, Bridgewater) to fully replace Copilot in their organizations.

---

## Sourcegraph 6.0 release will cut Jan 15

### What?

On [Jan 29th](https://www.notion.so/Exec-team-decision-log-433eb6df050e464098d1ab28b64652db?pvs=21) we will have a marketing moment for Sourcegraph centered around one box and teams (a.k.a. multi-tenant). Here is what you should know about it:

- It's going to be a major version bump! **6.0 here we go!**
- We will be cutting from main on **January 15th**
- We will be releasing to customers on **January 29th**
- Backporting will be allowed only for critical changes and must be approved by @Quinn Slack or @Erika Rice Scherpelz

### Why?

From a GTM perspective, this delay between cut and release allows GTM to know exactly what is in the release and plan marketing and sales materials accordingly. From an EPD perspective, this reduces the time pressure on cutting the release and fixing critical issues.

### More info

## We will build a custom token refresh mechanism on VS Code, JetBrains, and JetBrains Gateway for Bridgewater

### What?

To unblock the Bridgewater deal, EPD has decided to build a custom token refresh mechanism for Bridgewater based on the implementation they want. Cody Core will support the custom work around managing their `credentialhelper` script on VS Code, JetBrains and JetBrains remote, and also support Bridgewater specifically if they have auth issues related to this implementation.

We are targeting to land this deal and the work needed (TBD) by 1/31/2025. Support for additional editors like Visual Studio is planned but not required to land the deal. 

### Why?

Bridgewater is a prestigious name in the financial industry, and securing this deal will create expansion opportunities for One Box, Code Search and the upcoming Agent/API product. Despite various implementation challenges, Bridgewater maintains strong interest in partnering with us, presenting an opportunity to fully replace GitHub Copilot across their engineering organization.

---

## We will merge the JetBrains repo into the VSCode, etc. repo

DRI: @Dominic Cooney 

To make JetBrains development easier and more efficient, we will move JetBrains development to the sourcegraph/cody repository. sourcegraph/jetbrains will be progressively retired (short term, it still collects issues from the JetBrains error reporter.) We have no immediate plans to move VS, Eclipse, emacs or neovim. [See RFC1010 for details.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TNFxxPoi3u_a2CMXtYEfZZ4L1WdVWEhvyZpRJIWp8ng/edit?tab=t.0)

## Eng hiring can be global for backend positions

### What?

All roles on Cody Core and Code Search remain SF-targeted, except where noted. Backend roles have no location restrictions.

### Why?

Thanks to the great progress we’ve made with SF hiring (2 PMs, 1 Eng IC, 1 Eng manager), we’re easing up location restrictions. However, we’re continuing to focus on SF for Cody Core and Code Search because these teams work very closely with PM. Cody Core and Code Search own the bulk of our UI, where rapid iteration and direct feedback have a large impact.

### More details

# Decisions made - Nov 11

## TPM Coverage across IDE, OneBox, API & Teams

---

Kalan will cover IDE parity & One Box
Ron will cover API & Teams (Multi-tenant)

Note: PM/s (Aravind) will continue to drive Self-hosted models (no TPM coverage). 

[reference slack thread](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01MFR66F0T/p1731335697217279?thread_ts=1731107145.369869&cid=C01MFR66F0T) (private channel)

## Intent detection will require Gateway for first one box release

---

### What

We will not support automatic intent detection for non-Gateway (BYOK, self-hosted models) customers for Jan 29th. We will support it eventually. As a consequence, non-Gateway customers will always have to manually select intent, with chat as the default

### Why

Intent will soon be behind the Gateway. This means that non-Gateway customers cannot access it. We want to move to a CPU based intent detection that can easily be deployed as part of a standard Sourcegraph instance, but we do not want to do that for Jan 29th.

The reason for the delay is two fold:

- Moving intent detection from GPU to CPU will require performance optimization work that is orthogonal to the quality work. The quality work is critical and impacts all customers.
- Keeping intent detection behind the Gateway allows us to iterate more quickly. Having intent detection as part of the deployment means we can only improve it at the customer upgrade cadence. Something behind the Gateway we can deploy at will, faster even than our release cycle. Thus, we think we should keep intent detection behind Gateway until we've gotten intent detection to a quality level where we are comfortable saying, "yeah, we're cool if the customer stays on this version for awhile even though the newer version is better".

Although this inconsistency increases the complexity of one box, non-Gateway customers are already special case, so this doesn’t materially change their situation.

See this [thread](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C0C324C91/p1731502552662049) for more details.

### Next steps

- Continue to iterate on intent detection quality
- Make sure one box works without automatic intent detection for non-Gateway customers
- Come up with a plan for getting intent detection moved to CPU. Note that all customers will use CPU-based intent detection once it’s available, not just non-Gateway customers.

### Assistant - 2024-12-13 16:13:22

ACK. Please continue providing the data when ready.

Exec decision log for the last month
# Decisions made week of December 16, 2024

## (PENDING) Separating marketing moments from monthly releases

---

Going forward, we will streamline monthly releases and separate them from marketing moments. Key changes:

- Decouple launch moments from monthly releases
- Reinforce beta as a default phase for major new features
- Standardize quarterly marketing launch timing to second month of the fiscal quarter
- Streamline monthly release processes to reduce the work it takes to get them out
- Add 1-week soak time for `sg/sg` releases

### Why?

Our current process ties marketing launch moments directly to monthly product releases, creating rigid dependencies and limiting flexibility. This change aims to address these challenges by decoupling these processes, improving alignment between marketing and engineering, and enhancing the overall quality and visibility of our product development efforts.

### More background & next steps

For more details and next steps see [Proposal: Marketing Launch & Release Process Updates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EovdRbeFSQTUwk_7KPoAvKl6cj6hK_FhaIeZEke-iTY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.8nozctbmjyhv)

# Decisions made week of December 2, 2024

## **Hiring a Head of Product**

---

We are kicking off the search for a new Head of Product to lead the team into FY26 and beyond. In the interim, Beyang will step in as the product leader, helping Quinn focus on CEO priorities, marketing support, and FDE.

### Why?

With new PMs joining the team and a sharper enterprise focus driving success, we’re in a strong position to bring on a new leader to take us to the next level. 

### More background

Quinn initially took on Product leadership after the departure of our former Head of Product, balancing these responsibilities with his role as CEO. The decision to delay the search allowed the Product team to grow and align with strategic priorities, including a sharper focus on enterprise customers and closer collaboration between PMs, TPMs, Design, and Sales/TS.

During this period:

- New PMs like Alex Romano (November) and Derek Feriancek (starting December 31) have joined the team, adding expertise and capacity.
- The team’s connections with GTM and EPD have strengthened, supporting major deals and ensuring tight alignment across functions.
- The Product team has been instrumental in our enterprise success, which will remain a key focus going forward.

To ensure Quinn can dedicate time to broader company initiatives—such as supporting Marketing during the search for a new leader, launching Forward Deployed Engineering, and focusing on CEO responsibilities—Beyang will take on interim leadership of the Product team.

# Decisions made week of November 11, 2024

## Marketing (PMM) will own the first call pitch deck

---

Marketing (specifically the PMM team) will have the responsibility/ownership of making sure that the first call pitch deck (and other central sales assets) are always kept up to date with the latest company and product messaging. Brock will be the approver and Quinn/Brock will be contributors.

The source of truth for messaging would be the [Company-level Message House](https://www.notion.so/Company-level-Message-House-38b7a083ef334e6a9bc2156fa548c689?pvs=21) 

### Why?

We need to ensure that we are telling a consistent story to our customers and prospects across all our touch points - the website, the one-pagers, the sales decks, events, social, videos, etc.

## EPD commitments for H1 FY26

---

You can find the commitments outlined in [FY26 H1 EPD Commitments](https://www.notion.so/FY26-H1-EPD-Commitments-137a8e11265880d8addbcf3d5fd8c5fc?pvs=21) 

As we go into FY26 planning, EPD has made commitments on some deliverables for early FY26, focusing on delivering high-quality, impactful features early in the year to support our effort to reach $100M revenue as fast as possible. 

Key commitments include IDE parity, One Box GA, Cody API beta, Teams launch, and self-hosted models, with an emphasis on collaboration between EPD and GTM teams to ensure success. These commitments prioritize strategic delivery dates and scope to align with long sales cycles and maximize impact.

### Why?

There's more discussion of this in the doc (and a bunch more FAQs!) but we use commitments when stakeholders are depending on us to deliver something by a certain time. E.g., for revenue commitments, a customer commitment, or a marketing moment.

## PLG free tier users will not be supported on Teams (multi-tenant), including one box functionality

---

For the January 29 release of Teams, it has been decided that the free tier will exclude one box functionality and private remote code context. Free tier users will still have access to Cody and classic code search for open source code on dotcom, but will not have access to private code indexing or multi-tenant functionality.

See: https://linear.app/sourcegraph/issue/PROD-374/final-decision-for-one-boxcontext-sources-for-sourcegraph-free-teams

### **Why?**

We want to maintain a high-quality user experience while managing technical scope. Allowing free users access to one box functionality would create challenges, especially with the potential removal of symf support in the future. Also, positioning Sourcegraph’s value on **users' own code** rather than open source code, sets the right expectations and makes our ICP focus clear. 

### More background

Teams won’t have a free tier initially, but we might add one depending on what we learn

### Assistant - 2024-12-13 16:13:58

ACK. Let me know when all the data has been provided.

:ring: EPD Commitments :ring:
tl;dr: Take a look at the planned EPD commitments.
As we go into FY26 planning, we need to make commitments to the company on some deliverables for early FY26 to that the GTM team can incorporate them into revenue planning. Here are our commitments around IDE parity, one box, API, multi-tenant and self-hosted models.
Please take a look and share your thoughts and questions! (Here, on the note, wherevs.)
FAQ
Why commitments?
There's more discussion of this in the doc (and a bunch more FAQs!) but we use commitments when stakeholders are depending on us to deliver something by a certain time. E.g., for revenue commitments, a customer commitment, or a marketing moment.
What's up with Jan 29th?
A couple of our commitments, specifically one box and Teams (aka multitenant) have a Jan 29th commitment date.
See my next post for why.

:rocket: FY26 H1 EPD Commitments
It’s time to make some commitments!
Created by Erika Rice ScherpelzCreated by Erika Rice Scherpelz | Nov 7th | Added by Notion

:calendar: Why Jan 29th? :calendar:
You may be thinking: This January 29th commitment date came out of nowhere. What is it? Why is it important? Are we holding ourselves to an arbitrary date just for fun?
Shipping a unified product — which product-wise includes one box and architecturally includes Teams (aka multitenant) — has been a core part of our FY25 strategy: Build toward one lovable code intelligence product.
Okay, you may say, but why so strict on the Jan 29th date? This is because we have ambitious revenue goals for next year. That means Q1 revenue is super critical (as are Q2, Q3, Q4 :smile:). And if something ships in Q1, then from a Sales perspective, it doesn't have much impact.
One box and Teams are critical because they expand our differentiation and our reach.
Without one box, we're just another in a class of very similar AI coding assistants. I think we're the best, but being the best alone is not enough in such a large and undifferentiated field, especially when there's an established default option (Github Copilot).
Teams expands our addressable market by providing a solution that serves teams or small companies who are too small for our enterprise offering but need more than the "single player" functionality of PLG.
All that said, it won't help us win if we ship a sub-par product, so we need to think about how we can build a well scoped, high quality product within the time constraints. And if that is too challenging, it's better to escalate that discussion early rather than wait and slip. (edited) 

:clipboard: Eng interview guidelines update :clipboard:
We will set level expectations for candidates based on years of experience and/or current level. We will remove down leveling as an option except where the years of experience is borderline (+/- one year of the boundary between levels).
Also, in such a competitive market, we need to be willing to accept more uncertainty. We should targeting 80%+ confidence with our yes decisions instead of the (made-up-number alert) 95% that I feel is our usual standard.

:package: One box planning offsite summary :package:
During our one box planning offsite in Amsterdam :flag-nl:, the team turned an uncertain and open-ended challenge into an ambitious but clearly scoped plan. There are still risks, but now they're managed!
:ty: Thanks again to 
@rob
, 
@Peter Guy
, 
@Naman
, 
@taiyab
, 
@Camden Cheek
, 
@Felix Kling
, and 
@Jan Hartman
 for all your incredible work and commitment throughout this offsite! :ty:

We focused on three main areas: natural language search, intent detection, and one box interface interaction.
Here's a high-level overview of what we accomplished:
Defined key milestones and broke down work into actionable steps, focusing on high-risk components.
Made significant progress on a UI/UX design, including scopes, filters, and search personalization improvements.
Got started with implementation, including moving search results to the new Search API, experimenting with ProseMirror for a more expressive input, and CPU based intent detection.
Our next milestone on November 28th aims to gather internal feedback :spiral_calendar_pad: on these core elements, including natural language search, scopes, and intent detection.

:arrows_counterclockwise: Postgres Version Update
We're switching from Postgres 12 to Postgres 16. To ensure your local environment is updated:
1. Run sg update
2. Run sg setup
These commands will install the correct Postgres version for your development environment and ensure you're correctly set up.
P.S: Your data won't be migrated from your old database.

:earth_africa: Eng hiring updates :earth_asia:
We are loosening up location restrictions for many of the roles in eng (details). As noted in that doc
All roles on Cody Core and Code Search remain SF-targeted, except where noted. Backend roles have no location restrictions.
Why? Thanks to the great progress we’ve made with SF hiring (2 PMs, 1 Eng IC, 1 Eng manager), we’re easing up location restrictions. However, we’re continuing to focus on SF for Cody Core and Code Search because these teams work very closely with PM. Cody Core and Code Search own the bulk of our UI, where rapid iteration and direct feedback have a large impact.
Please let me or your manager know if you have any questions!

:rocket: Sourcegraph 6.0 January release schedule :rocket:
On Jan 29th we will have a marketing moment for Sourcegraph centered around one box and teams (a.k.a. multi-tenant). Here is what you should know about it:
It's going to be a major version bump! 6.0 here we go!
We will be cutting from main on January 15th
We will be releasing to customers on January 29th
Backporting will be allowed only for critical changes and must be approved by 
@beyang
 or 
@Erika RS
 (switched from 
@sqs
 now that 
@beyang
 is interim head of product)
From a GTM perspective, this delay between cut and release allows GTM to know exactly what is in the release and plan marketing and sales materials accordingly. From an EPD perspective, this reduces the time pressure on cutting the release and fixing critical issues.
For more detail, keep an eye on the EPD-Marketing Project Plan. The source of truth for this decision is the EPD decision log. The source of truth for the release schedule generally is the release page.

Background: When a customer escalation comes up, teams often need input about how to prioritize it against other work.

FY26 H1 EPD commitments

It’s time to make some commitments! 

As we get closer to FY26, we must align our EPD efforts with the growth goals that will get us to $100m. Our goals are ambitious but critical to be #1. These items are the subset of the overall [priorities](https://linear.app/sourcegraph/initiative/productprioritiesfy2025-3af5d4eb9fad/overview) that we are upgrading to commitments. See the FAQ for more details.

You may notice that these commitments are focused on early FY26. This is intentional. Our largest deals have long cycles, often 6 months or more. The things we want to bet on for FY26 revenue are the things we deliver early, ideally by the start of or early Q1. 

This is an aggressive but feasible plan. We’ll put it at risk if we move staffing away from these key projects, so we must carefully assess any proposed staffing changes that impact any of this work. Hiring can derisk this work some, but given hiring and ramp up time, only minimally.

## **Key Priorities for H1 2026**

### **IDE Parity**

- **Commitment:** By end of Q1, JetBrains quality concerns should be a distant memory. Visual Studio chat-only GA in Q1 with a to-be-determined timeline for additional features such as autocomplete and in-line edits. (Eclipse timeline still waiting on customer feedback and demand.)
- **Impact:** This one is first not because it’s the most strategically important, but because high quality coverage of the most highly used IDEs is table stakes. Let’s get there.
- **Risks:** The folks working on this are also involved in other priorities on this list. We need to make sure these efforts get sufficient attention.

### **One box GA**

- **Commitment:** Jan 29th GA
- **Impact:** One box brings together search, our historical strength and combines it with the flexibility of LLM generated output. This combined product will bring differentiation in a crowded market.
- **Risks**: Any delay in development or support resourcing may impact the timeline, and phased feature releases may be considered to mitigate risk.

### **Cody API: Experimental and Beta Phase Launch**

- **Commitment:** Beta by Q1, GA by end of April 2025
- **Impact**: The Cody API will provide a foundational building block for integrating AI-driven coding capabilities into customer workflows, enabling broader platform adoption.
- **Risks**: Staffing challenges may impact the onboarding rate or extend beta timelines, which could delay the GA release. We will be working closely with early adopters to get feedback and build out workflows.

### **Sourcegraph Teams launch (aka Workspaces aka Multi-tenant)**

- **Commitment:** Jan 29th all new paid users on Teams with opt-in for existing users, ramp up to all paid users on Teams as quickly as scaling allows.
- **Impact**: Having a self-serve, one box enabled Sourcegraph will reduce onboarding overhead for small teams, make it easier to set up trials, and generally positive impact sales cycles.
- **Risks**: There is some staffing overlap with one box. We are still scoping out the IDE client integration work.

### **Self-hosted Models GA**

- **Commitment:** By mid-January, this is generally available to *qualified* customers. We aim to recommend a prescribed path with specific models and deployments that we have tested and confident in supporting. Any customer who is outside of this prescribed path are not part of this commitment and will need to evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
- **Impact:** Although we believe that most customers will benefit from being using our services to get access to the highest quality models and capabilities, this isn’t always an option. Self-hosted models allow us to bring Enterprises with very high isolation requirements onto our platform.
- **Risks:** The prescribed path is not enough, and we will need to take on custom work. Another risk is we end up requiring additional work for scaling these types of deployments.

## **Commitment to GTM**

When we say that these efforts are prioritized, this means more than producing a high quality, well scoped technical product — although that’s critical! EPD will work closely with Sales and Support to make sure we have clarity on pricing, rollout strategy, documentation, customer qualification and all of the other pieces necessary to make sure we’re shipping products, not merely technologies. 

## Cody Strat + FDEs

We will be ramping up FDEs (forward deployed engineers). These engineers will be working directly with large strategic partners to unlock substantial deals. Today, that work is distributed throughout the eng team. Going forward, we expect to free up some eng capacity by moving that work to FDEs. However, until we have people in those roles, we’ll stick with the status quo. 

## **Looking Ahead**

I'm incredibly proud of the work our team has already put in. None of these projects are new. We will continue to focus and invest to deliver the product that will allow our Sales team to run fast because they are backed by a compelling, high quality product. 

## Next steps

- **Everyone:** Please reach out on `#epd-planning` if there are missing blockers or risks.
- **EMs**: Assess your team's bandwidth and ensure alignment with these priorities.

## FAQ

**Why these items?** 

- There are many reasons we create commitments. This particular list is based on the items that EPD and GTM agree are critical for their ability to set and hit FY26 revenue targets.

**How does this relate to the priorities in Linear?** 

- Our source of truth for priorities is [this Linear initiative](https://linear.app/sourcegraph/initiative/productprioritiesfy2025-3af5d4eb9fad/overview). This document only covers the subset of work we are upgrading to EPD commitments to the company. There is some work in the priorities list that is higher priority than some of these commitments. That is still correct, but if working on those higher priority items puts these commitment dates at risk, please escalate.

**Why is the Linear list FY25 and this is FY26?**  

- The first was named based on when we’re doing the work. The second on when we’re delivering the work.

**What is a commitment?** 

- A *commitment* means EPD will deliver a high-quality feature as agreed upon by a certain date, and will follow through at the expense (if needed) of non-committed projects. It could be deal-specific or customer-specific if it’s defined as such. Any change to scope or timing requires stakeholder approval.
- Work that is not on this list has a *target*. All work in progress should have a target. Targets give stakeholders a rough idea of what will be done and when. They can be changed although changes should be communicated broadly to stakeholders.
- [Reference](https://www.notion.so/Product-Planning-d70a4841b098455facc53a97ed400ec3?pvs=21)

**Why doesn’t project X have a commitment?**

- Commitments are important, but they reduce flexibility. We should not make projects into commitments unless we feel there is value to the company to associate them with specific, hard to move dates and scope. A commitment should be something we’re wiling to put other projects at risk to follow through on. We are selective about commitments because if we have too many commitments, it reduces our flexibility in derisking the items we are committed to.

**Some of these commitments are lower priority than other things. How does that work?**

- The project priority list ranks the projects in priority order. However, for projects with commitments, we should putting the commitment date and scope at risk. But as long as the commitment date isn't put at risk, the higher priority item should be done first. (If we always said “commitments first” then work that is important but doesn’t require a company level commitment could be starved indefinitely.)

Updates from our #progress channel

:palm_tree:  2:11 PM
Since the launch of Telemetry V2, we've been seamlessly receiving all events instrumented in our new SDKs from most Sourcegraph instances, including on-prem instances - in the last 30 days alone:
Telemetry Gateway (the MSP service which receives all this data) processed over 600 million events
333 Sourcegraph instances reported more than 5,000 events (there are only ~162 instances in Cloud!)
105 Sourcegraph instances reported more than 100,000 events
These events don't just come from Cody - all events from all product components, in clients and web apps and serverside, are able to emit granular telemetry by default through a universal system. We've been able to do this with confidence because the strict Telemetry V2 schema enables us to trust events by default, minimising risks around unintentionally sharing sensitive data that is not covered by agreements. This infrastructure also ensures we can scale even for very large volumes of events to serve our growing data needs: we recently saw dotcom export 1.5M events/hour without much of a hitch.
#thanks to the hard work from #discuss-analytics for taking Telemetry V2 and working to use it to its fullest potential :smile: :pray: Today, based on a proposal from the team to extend Telemetry V2, we've now rolled out "user metadata export" in Cloud, re-using much of the same infrastructure as V2 Telemetry to share user emails and in-instance organisations to help augment the insights we can offer our customers in Cody Analytics. This has been an increasingly-common ask from customers, and I'm excited to see the kinds of insights #discuss-customer-facing-analytics will be able to build from this data :tadanimated: (edited)

:rocket:Managed Sourcegraph Multi-Tenant Initiative: Phase 3 Complete :sparkles:
The Managed Multi-Tenant Sourcegraph working group held an offsite in Berlin last week to close out our phase 3 goals of having an end-to-end user experience and flow designed, partially built, and available for internal testing
While there we were also able to
Solidify UX flows/designs
Bootstrap multiple missing UX pages
Pair/swarm on high-risk, critical functionalities
Integrate an end-to-end onboarding experience for manual and automated testing
We made progress across the board and while there is still a lot left to do, we feel great that we landed core pieces of functionality to wrap up phase 3.
Highlights
Onboarding Flow:
The service is running and supports the critical onboarding flow (payment → workspace → repos → search). Though slightly clunky, it functions and we now have a clear design for improvement.
Functionality:
Initial support for recurring payments.
Initial repo onboarding functionality built, with backend support to add public repos without app installs and support seamless api installs.
Indexed text and symbol search support.
Initial work on member management settings pages and necessary APIs created to allow for inviting users.
User Experience:
Updated workspaces designs for onboarding flows.
Ensured the Svelte UI dev server works with hot-reloading for multi-tenancy.
Performance:
Built infrastructure for effective scale testing, allowing us to create thousands of tenants and monitor system performance.
Continued database performance analysis and optimization.
Quality:
Discovered and resolved numerous bugs and performance issues.
Try it out!
As we continue to iterate, we invite you to test it out with us!  Visit the workspaces page and join or create your own workspace. Please note that the experiences and functionality will evolve frequently over the two months, and we may purge all data occasionally.

:cody:  We just launched Deep Cody (an agent for chat!) for Pro users in VS Code pre-release 1.49.1733379007 about 12 hours ago, and the initial feedback we got have been very positive so far!
 Here are some feedback highlights from our users :sparkles:
Pretty impressed with the first thing that I asked DeepCody. Good stuff. This looks like the future.
DeepCody is absolute beast in web developing guys. Like guys, look at this, completly made by DeepCody with single prompt about 20 words: https://codepen.io/Fox-ems/pen/yyBebry
deep cody is beast. make the price 15$ in month. its worthy
the memory thing of deep cody that persists is the best thing I have seen in a while
Once DeepCody evolves and Sourcegraph comes up with an open-source VSC fork that competes with Cursor and Windsurf, it’s over. We’re only 1 step away from taking the AI space from others_
I had a very interesting experience with DeepCody. I needed to implement a complex test, and I tried Cursor Agent and Windsurf Agent, but they couldn’t handle it. With DeepCody... it directly implemented the tests from the first try, making them work properly.
This update has addressed some latency issues we had with Deep Cody, some improvement to its response format, and added a new memory tool (very early stage) that allows Cody to personalize its response :one-piece_swimsuit: It will be included in the v1.50.0 stable release that comes out next week, available in all Cody clients for our PLG Pro users.
Deep Cody is now disabled on the older version of VS code, so please make sure to upgrade your extension to 1.49.1733379007 if you want to try it out.
Deep Cody is an experimental feature, so we’d love to hear your thoughts on how we can make it even better. Please fee; free to share your feedback / ideas in #wg-deep-cody.!

Hi everyone, We have released the AutoEdits feature on the S2 instance for dogfooding!!
AutoEdits is more context-aware, using recent edits made in the editor as its primary context source. It replaces Autocomplete and addresses the following limitations of Autocomplete:
Provides suggestions for deletions and additions around the current cursor position.
Autocomplete requires typing to generate suggestions, whereas AutoEdits suggests relevant edits based on cursor movements.
Offers inline suggestions even when there is existing content after the cursor (suffix).
Here is a short Loom video demonstrating the feature in action.
AutoEdits is an experimental feature available for vscode. Please let us know your feedback and report any failure cases in the #wg-autonomous-coding channel. (edited)

The list of commitments doesn't read as a script. Update it. (E.g., I wouldn't say "One Box GA by January 29th". I'd say something like "On January 29th we'll be releasing..."

I've updated the introduction to highlight the historic opportunity to lead in reducing toil and increasing automation, as well as adjusted the commitments section to flow more naturally as a spoken script. Let me know if there are any additional edits you'd like!

### User - 2024-12-13 16:38:13

Update references from "Cody API" to "Cody Agents". In the section on it in the commitment sections, add something like "We have changed our focus from building a Cody API to building vertically oriented agents on top of that API."

It’s a cornerstone of our differentiation strategy, especially as we compete in a crowded field with established players like Cursor, Codeium, and GitHub Copilot. There is still a lot of work to do, and the team is working on pulling together an ambitious roadmap quickly with improvements to intent detection, natural language search, the search UI, and more all in progress.\n\n- **Cody Agents will enter EAP**: We have changed our focus from building a generic Cody API to building vertically oriented agents on top of that foundational API. These agents will provide tailored solutions for specific workflows, making the platform even more valuable for customers. Customers will be able to customize these to their own needs and build their own agents. Our first focus is creating a small number of high quality Agents.\n\n- **We’ll launch Multi-tenant**: This self-serve version of Sourcegraph will lower the barrier to adoption for teams and small-to-medium businesses.

And Deep Cody, our advanced chat agent, has been a standout\u2014it\u2019s already impressing users in the VS Code pre-release with its ability to tackle complex coding tasks.\n\n- **Postgres 16 Upgrade**: Postgres 12 was reaching its end-of-life, but thanks to close collaboration between the Release team and Technical Services, the upgrade to Postgres 16 has been smooth for our customers. This update unlocks four major versions' worth of new features, which we\u2019ll fully leverage starting in January.\n\n- **Cody Pro ARR Milestone**: We crossed \$888K in self-serve ARR for Cody Pro! This is a huge milestone that highlights the growing demand for Cody and validates the hard work of the team.\n\n- **Code AI Summit Success**: Our recent summit brought together 965 attendees from 715 companies.
