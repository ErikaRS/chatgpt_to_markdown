Product-Focused Planning
Our product planning and execution strategy is designed to align with the company's strategic objectives, marketing goals, and feedback from our customers. Planning is continuous with quarterly check-ins. 
It’s the product teams – engineering and product together – that have the expertise, context and pride of ownership to be best suited to propose the highest impact work that fits those goals. And they’re the team that can do the correct eng scoping.
Planning Process
Planning is continuous, guided by (details below):
The company's strategic objectives and product roadmap
Marketing goals
Feedback from our customers, especially top GTM requests
Internal needs such as scalability, reliability, performance, and security
Work items from these input sources are divided into three categories:
Work in progress: Work that the team has already started. These items have specified target dates, based on the work's scope and requirements.
Coming soon queue: This is a short (1-5) ordered list of planned work without set target dates, allowing for flexibility based on evolving needs. This work should represent the team’s most important upcoming work, across all categories. 
Backlog: An unordered set of work with no associated target dates or commitments. 
In this model, work can have two types of dates:
Commitment dates: set for work with external commitments (external to the company or external to EPD, such as to GTM or Marketing). Work can be committed without yet being started.
Changing a commitment date requires approval from the stakeholders involved. 
Target dates: set only for work in progress to give stakeholders a rough idea of when the work might be delivered. 
These dates can be changed by the team at will, giving the team flexibility to adjust based on trade-offs between date and scope (we should always aim for high quality).
When new work comes up (or revisiting backlog work), the team should go through the following process:
Does this work have an external commitment date? When does the work need to be started to meet that commitment date?
Changing a commitment date or the scope of a commitment requires buy in from whoever it’s a commitment to. 
Should this work interrupt work in progress?
Default answer is no! Interrupting work in progress should occur only for unavoidably urgent work like an incident or a commitment with a date outside of our control.
If it shouldn’t interrupt work in progress, should it go in the coming soon queue? If so, where?
If the coming soon queue gets longer than 5 items, the team will have to remove work items to ensure that the team is focused on a small set of top priorities. When items are removed from the coming soon queue, stakeholders should be informed. 
If it’s not coming soon, add it to the backlog (or close as won’t fix).
Strategic goals and product roadmap
Although the strategic goals are expected to be stable, the product roadmap is an evolving document based on customer needs, the competitive landscape, and customer feedback. The Product team owns the product roadmap, and PMs are responsible for working roadmap updates into team plans.
Marketing goals
A significant portion of our planning efforts will be centralized around features coordinated for marketing launches. This focus ensures that we deliver a cohesive and impactful set of features that support our marketing narratives. 
Marketing themes should be set 3-6 months in advance of the marketing event, with the Product team responsible for working the work associated with a marketing launch into the product roadmap and team plans. 
Customer Feedback and GTM Requests
Product Managers are responsible for aggregating customer feedback across different channels and working it into the product roadmap and team plans (small customer feedback items do not need to be in the roadmap). 
To aid Product Managers in gathering feedback from GTM, EPD and TS will work together to periodically create a list of top GTM product gaps. Product gaps can be raised more frequently, and issues should be escalated as needed. The top GTP product gaps is an opportunity to ensure that GTM requests are being reconsidered periodically. 
Internal needs
Engineering, Product, and Design teammates will have items that need to be addressed to meet foundational goals such as scalability, reliability, performance, and security. This includes ongoing maintenance, architectural improvements, and polishing of existing features. 
Quarterly Check-ins
Per-team check-ins are where we come together to ensure we’re aware of progress and aligned with direction. The purpose of the planning review is for each team to present their progress and a snapshot of their proposed work and get feedback from the exec team as to whether there is agreement on direction or if adjustments need to be made. 
A planning review will consist of content to cover at least the following topics:
Retrospective: 
How well did we do in accomplishing our goals since last quarter? 
What data supports those conclusions?
Status: 
How well is the product serving the needs of our customers and the business? 
How well have you hit your metrics targets?
Plan snapshot: 
What are your external commitments? What is the current work in progress? What work items are coming soon? 
How does this work meet our business goals and how does it serve the needs of our customers? 
What data are you using to drive your planning? 
Have you done the high-level eng scoping to give you confidence that your team will be able to get committed work done by the committed date? 
Note, not every team will have work that applies to every goal. Likewise, not every work item is expected to meet a strategic goal.
Success Metrics: 
What KPIs and targets have you set to measure the success of this work?
Risks/Open Questions/Needs: 
What are the biggests risks? What are the mitigations? 
What guidance would you like from the exec team? 
Do you have everything you need to be successful?
Excluded: 
What items are just below the line on your backlog? 
What requests to your team have you decided not to put on your backlog?
TPMs will schedule reviews for each team throughout the quarter to include interested members of the exec team, the leads of the product team (at least the EPD triad) and other interested stakeholders. At the end of a review, the execs and the product team will either be in alignment or the team will address the concerns and schedule a follow-up (repeat as needed). 
Review Effectiveness
Some tips for having an effective review:
Make sure the priorities for your work are clear – what’s Must Have (P0), Want To Have (P1) and Nice To Have (P2)? What could get cut?
Make sure the customer (internal and/or external) impact is clear – if we do this work, what’s the value to the customer?
Make sure the business impact is clear: how does this work help us achieve our strategic goals?
In addition to ensuring that the EPD team is aligned before heading into the review, try to get as much alignment with execs ahead of time as possible.
Engineer Scoping
For any launch, we have a finite amount of time and a finite number of engineers. Before setting a target date, EPD should have done a high level assessment to ensure a high level of confidence in the target date. As work items move from coming soon to work in progress, teams should continue to refine target dates.
The eng scoping work is the difference between eyeballing a list of requirements and hoping we can get them all done and actually having some confidence that we can accomplish what we want. And if we can’t, we want to know that ASAP so we can adjust dates or cut scope.
