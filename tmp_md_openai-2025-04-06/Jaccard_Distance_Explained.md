The Jaccard distance, also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient or Jaccard index, is a measure of similarity between two sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection of the sets divided by the size of their union. The resulting value ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates complete similarity.

Mathematically, the Jaccard distance (JD) between two sets A and B is calculated as:

JD(A, B) = 1 - (|A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|)

where |A| represents the cardinality (number of elements) of set A, and |A ∩ B| and |A ∪ B| represent the cardinalities of the intersection and union of sets A and B, respectively.

The Jaccard distance is often used in various fields, such as information retrieval, data mining, and bioinformatics, to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between sets of data. It is particularly useful when dealing with binary or categorical data, where the presence or absence of elements is of interest.
