Stephen R. Covey's book "First Things First" focuses on time management and life prioritization, expanding on the principles introduced in his earlier work, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People." The key messages of "First Things First" revolve around organizing one's life according to principles of personal leadership, prioritizing tasks based on their importance rather than their urgency, and leading a principle-centered life. Here are some of the core concepts:

1. **Quadrant II Time Management**: Covey introduces the time management matrix, dividing activities into four quadrants based on urgency and importance. Quadrant II (important but not urgent) is emphasized as the area where we should focus our time and energy for long-term effectiveness, including activities like planning, relationship building, and personal development.

2. **Principle-Centered Living**: The book argues for a principle-centered approach to prioritizing our lives, suggesting that decisions should be made based on personal values and principles rather than external pressures or temporary conditions.

3. **Mission Statement**: Covey advocates for the creation of a personal or family mission statement to guide decision-making and ensure actions align with one’s core values and long-term goals.

4. **The Role of Vision and Values**: Emphasizing the importance of having a clear vision and solid values, the book suggests these are essential for prioritizing our lives effectively, enabling us to say "no" to lesser things and "yes" to the most important.

5. **Synergy in Relationships**: The importance of building strong relationships and understanding interdependence is highlighted as key to effective personal and professional life management.

6. **Balance**: Covey discusses the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between work and personal life, ensuring that time is allocated not just to professional success but to all aspects of personal well-being.

7. **Renewal**: The concept of renewal or self-care is introduced as critical for maintaining the ability to prioritize effectively. This includes physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual renewal.

"First Things First" challenges the traditional notions of time management by emphasizing effectiveness over efficiency and aligning one’s daily actions with deeper values and principles. It's about living life in a way that is genuinely reflective of one’s priorities and making the most of the time we have.
