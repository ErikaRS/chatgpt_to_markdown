To start effectively, it's valuable to understand some broader context around your current task and how it aligns with your role and responsibilities:

### Overview of Skills and Context:

As a VP of Engineering responsible for significant organizational decisions (especially strategic ones around transitioning business models and product integrations), you draw from multiple skills and experiences:

- **Strategic thinking:** Essential for navigating the shift from enterprise-focused recurring revenue to self-serve, consumption-based models.
- **Technical depth with business acumen:** Balancing technical insights about modular computing platforms (mCPs), open-source strategies, and monetization pathways is critical.
- **Organizational alignment:** You're facilitating change in an environment where your senior peers (CEO/CTO) are more technology-oriented than business-driven, which means effectively managing upward and sideways becomes crucial.
- **Influence and communication:** Your ability to clearly convey complex strategic shifts to multiple stakeholders—engineering teams, sales, product, and leadership—is fundamental.
- **Understanding complementary strategies:** Familiarity with the "commoditize your complement" concept is key; you're strategically leveraging open-source adoption to drive monetization in adjacent proprietary offerings.

### Related Roles and Work:

The task you're undertaking involves multiple roles commonly found in organizations going through growth or transformation:

- **Product Managers (PMs)**: Typically involved in defining pricing and go-to-market strategies, PMs rely on clear strategic direction.
- **Business Development/Strategy Leads**: Usually responsible for shaping broader partnership and integration strategies, including platform expansions and integrations.
- **Architects and Senior Engineers**: Deeply involved in ensuring technical readiness for open-source integrations, modularity, and security.
- **Sales and Marketing Teams**: Essential stakeholders for shifting to consumption-based models and effectively positioning new product capabilities.
- **Developer Relations/Community Engagement Specialists**: Particularly relevant if you're leveraging open-source; they'll ensure strong community adoption, feedback, and engagement.

### Broader Contextual Information:

- **Market dynamics**: Many organizations are shifting toward consumption-based models to increase flexibility, user engagement, and capture value aligned with customer usage.
- **Open source strategy implications**: Open sourcing can accelerate adoption and drive developer interest but requires strategic alignment with clear monetization pathways and robust community management.
- **"Better together" strategies**: Successfully positioning products as complementary requires a compelling narrative and clear integration benefits.
- **Security and Access Control**: Particularly in consumption-based and open-source scenarios, strong security and clear user access controls are foundational to sustained trust and enterprise adoption.

With this overview, you're well-positioned to approach the business plan strategically and thoughtfully. Let's proceed with the specific task at hand. Could you specify your next step or any particular questions or components you'd like to focus on next?

Also, remember to pause afterward and reflect on how this strategic exploration helped you solidify your understanding—reflection is key to integrating learning deeply.

Help me brainstorm alternative metaphors / simpler explanations for the idea that low performance in your core responsibility can cap your potential performance review rating no matter how much extra good stuff you do.

Them
Hey! After some more thought I do have a question (hopefully clear this is more inquisitive than pointed - all things in life considered I’m glad to be here in the role I am.)
My question is this: running with my theoretical of ‘if I had made the decision to deprioritize/harm the customers I ended up helping’ - and with some sentiment you articulated along the lines of ‘if I was in a different role, I’d have been excelling at it’ in mind - I wonder whether..
(a) This is on X team, they met expectations + on yet-to-be-established different role, they excelled == meeting expectations
or (b) on X team, they didn't meet expectations + on yet-to-be-established different role, they excelled == meeting expectations
I am guessing the answer is mostly (b)? the reason I ask is because I am basically wondering to what extent we give consideration etc. to out-of-role contributions so I can make sure to take that into consideration in the future. I think I know the answer, but want to confirm so I don’t over-correct too aggressively


Me
If I had to choose between these two framings, I think it would be fair to call it (b) but with an important caveat: given how much of the X team aspects were outside of your control, even if we completely ignored the different role style work, I would not have recommended giving you a partially meets. But if we look at the team's performance for the year, then overall the team partially met and as TL, that reflects on you.
The way that I would suggest modeling this is that if your core responsibility is not doing well even if it's for reasons outside your control, that's going to cap your overall ceiling. The two ways to get around that are (a) improve things on the core responsibility or (b) explicitly transfer responsibility for that core responsibility.
Another metaphor: if a business fails to meet its earnings expectations in its core business, it will probably be dinged in the market for that even if they made up for it in overall earnings based on other lines of business. But if they meet those expectations, then their other achievements will be taken as even more awesome.
Does that make sense? Too theoretical?

You're looking for simpler metaphors or clearer explanations to convey the concept: "If you underperform in your core responsibility, your overall performance rating is capped, no matter how well you perform elsewhere."

Here are a few alternatives that might resonate clearly:

### Alternative Metaphors:

1. **The Cake and the Icing**  
   *"You can have amazing icing, but if the cake itself doesn't taste good, no one's going to say it's a great cake. Your core responsibilities are the cake; the extra contributions are the icing."*

2. **The Anchor and the Sailboat**  
   *"No matter how strong the wind or well-set the sails, if there's an anchor dragging along the bottom, the boat can only go so fast. Your core responsibilities are the anchor—you have to lift it first."*

3. **Leaky Bucket**  
   *"No matter how much water you pour into a bucket, if there's a hole at the bottom, you can’t fill it. The core responsibilities are patching that hole first."*

4. **Foundations vs. Decorations**  
   *"You can have beautiful decorations in your house, but if the foundation is cracked, people will still be worried about the house itself. Your core role is the foundation."*

5. **Main Course vs. Side Dishes**  
   *"If the main course isn't satisfying, it doesn’t matter how delicious the side dishes are—people leave disappointed."*

### Simple Explanation (Plain English):

*"Your overall performance is largely judged by your core role first. If your main responsibility isn’t hitting expectations, no matter how valuable your additional work is, it won’t fully offset that. Focus on ensuring your primary role meets expectations—then extra contributions significantly boost your standing."*

### Reflection Reminder:  
After you've shared these metaphors, pause to reflect on which one resonated most clearly. Understanding why a certain metaphor connects better will help you communicate more effectively in the future.
