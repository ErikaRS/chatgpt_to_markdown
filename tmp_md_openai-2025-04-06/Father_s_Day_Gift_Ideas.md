My husband is into board games, 3d printing, reading (especially sci fi and fantasy), good food, cooking, and nice drinks. He is fairly handy around the house. When he wants or needs something, he tends to just by it himself rather than waiting to get it as a gift, so he kind of "has it all".

What's a good father's day gift for him from a 5-year-old and a 9-year-old

Based on your husband's interests, here are some Father's Day gift ideas that your children could help put together:

1. **Board Game:** Since he's into board games, you can look into getting him a new game that he doesn't own yet. The children could help pick it out, and it can be something they can play together as a family. There are many age-appropriate board games out there, like "Ticket to Ride: First Journey" or "Catan Junior."

2. **Custom Apron:** For his love of cooking, a personalized apron could be a great gift. You can have one made with a message like "World's Best Dad and Chef". The children could help design it or choose the color.

3. **Recipe Box:** Have the kids decorate a small box and fill it with their favorite recipes that they've enjoyed cooking with dad. They can write the recipes on index cards and put them in the box.

4. **3D Printed Object:** Since he likes 3D printing, it could be really fun and touching if the kids could design something for him to print. There are simple CAD programs online that they could use to design a keychain, bookmark, or simple desk object, like a pencil holder, with the help of an adult. They could write a message or their names on it in the CAD program.

5. **Homemade Bookmarks:** If he's an avid reader, homemade bookmarks could be an ideal gift. Your children could make them from craft materials, possibly themed around his favorite books.

6. **Handmade Coasters:** This could be a fun and practical craft for the kids. They could be themed around his interests - sci-fi, fantasy, or board games. There are a lot of simple DIY coaster tutorials online.

7. **Father's Day Coupon Book:** The children could create a little coupon book with promises like "One free car wash" or "Breakfast in bed" or "Game night of your choice". It's a personal gift that would definitely be used and appreciated.

Remember that what makes these gifts special is not their monetary value, but the thought, effort, and love that your children put into them. And, they would enjoy spending time with their father doing the activities associated with these gifts.
