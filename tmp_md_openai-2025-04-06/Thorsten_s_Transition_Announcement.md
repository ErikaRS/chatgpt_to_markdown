A team member is converting from being a manager to an individual contributor. 

The original draft anouncement:
**Team changes: Thorsten returning to IC**

Hello team! After about a year of experimenting with being a manager, @thorsten is going back to being an IC. He will continue reporting to me. All of the folks on Search and Source will report to me until we can hire an EM, Platform to manage those teams and Graph.

Please let us know if you have any thoughts or questions!

The feedback: 
Hey! Agree on the proactive messaging here. I think one line you’d want to add is what I’ll be working on. For example: “He will continue reporting to me, but work on larger-scope projects as an IC, individually or helping out other teams” (or something like that). That removes the question of “wait, did they think about what he’ll do next? or is this a panic-step-down?”

The feedback on the feedback: 
Hi! Not sure your thoughts on the feedback, but I want to be careful with stating "larger-scope projects" or helping out other teams as he is an IC5 and we have other IC5's so want to be conscious he is being treated special...

Suggest a way of phrasing things that captures the concern from the first feedback (making it clear what thorsten will do next and that this was thoughtfully planned out) and the second feedback (not implying Thorsten is getting special treatment)

Certainly! Here's a revised announcement that takes into account both pieces of feedback:

---

**Team changes: Thorsten returning to IC**

Hello team! After about a year of experimenting with being a manager, @thorsten is transitioning back to the role of an Individual Contributor (IC). He will continue reporting to me. In this role, Thorsten will focus on key projects that align with his expertise and strengths, ensuring we continue to drive our team's mission forward. This move has been thoughtfully considered to best utilize Thorsten's talents and to meet our team's evolving needs.

All of the folks on Search and Source will report to me until we can hire an EM for Platform to manage those teams and Graph.

Please let us know if you have any thoughts or questions!

This phrasing emphasizes that Thorsten's transition is a well-considered move, highlights the positive impact he will have in his IC role, and avoids implying any special treatment.
