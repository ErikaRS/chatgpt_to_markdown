For a small, easy-to-transport pet that isn't a dog, consider the following options:

1. **Cats**: Cats are generally low-maintenance and can adapt to traveling if introduced to it gradually.
2. **Small Birds**: Birds like parakeets or canaries are relatively easy to transport with a suitable travel cage.
3. **Hamsters or Gerbils**: These small rodents are easy to care for and can be transported in a secure travel cage.
4. **Rabbits**: While slightly larger, rabbits can be transported in a pet carrier and are generally low-maintenance.
5. **Fish**: A small, portable fish tank can be an option, though care must be taken during travel to ensure the water stays stable.
6. **Reptiles**: Small reptiles like geckos or small snakes are easy to transport in appropriate containers and don't require frequent feeding.

Each of these pets has its own specific care requirements, so it's important to choose one that fits your lifestyle and travel routine.

Yes, rabbits often live longer and are generally happier when they have a companion. Rabbits are social animals and can benefit greatly from the company of another rabbit. Here are some additional considerations for keeping pet rabbits that might not be covered in standard lists:

1. **Bonding Process**: Introducing two rabbits requires a careful bonding process. Rabbits can be territorial, so it's important to introduce them slowly and in neutral territory to prevent fighting.

2. **Space Requirements**: Rabbits need plenty of space to hop around. A small cage is not sufficient; they need a large enclosure or a room where they can roam freely.

3. **Diet**: A rabbit's diet should consist mainly of hay, fresh vegetables, and a small amount of pellets. Hay is crucial for their digestive health and to keep their teeth worn down.

4. **Grooming**: Rabbits require regular grooming to prevent their fur from matting and to reduce the risk of hairballs. Long-haired breeds need more frequent grooming.

5. **Litter Training**: Rabbits can be litter trained, which makes them easier to manage indoors. Provide a litter box with a paper-based or wood pellet litter, not clay or clumping litter.

6. **Chewing**: Rabbits have a natural instinct to chew. Provide plenty of chew toys and rabbit-safe materials to prevent them from chewing on furniture or wires.

7. **Health Care**: Regular veterinary check-ups are essential. Rabbits can suffer from dental issues, gastrointestinal stasis, and other health problems that require prompt attention.

8. **Time and Attention**: Rabbits need daily social interaction and mental stimulation. Spend time playing with them and providing enrichment activities.

9. **Spaying/Neutering**: It's advisable to spay or neuter rabbits to prevent unwanted litters and reduce aggressive behavior. Spaying females also reduces the risk of uterine cancer.

10. **Temperature Sensitivity**: Rabbits are sensitive to extreme temperatures. Ensure they are kept in a cool, well-ventilated environment during hot weather and warm during cold weather.

Understanding these aspects of rabbit care can help ensure a happy and healthy life for your pet rabbits.
