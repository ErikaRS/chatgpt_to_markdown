Agency-taking or agency-giving beliefs
A useful tool during self-reflection, this framing helps us spot unproductive behaviors that may arise from various beliefs we hold. It is based on a deceptively simple distinction: given a belief we might have, is it taking agency away from us, or is it giving us agency?

An agency-taking belief usually stops us from doing what we want to accomplish. For instance, we might want to get into better physical shape, but to do that, we must spend money on joining an expensive fitness club or invest inordinately large amounts of time into strenuous exercise. Who has the time?! This belief is agency-taking, because it creates a barrier to us getting fit. If we change this belief to “maybe all it takes is a few minutes of daily exercise?”, we will suddenly gain more agency.

Similarly, we might believe that the only way to support our family is to stay at a place of employment we don’t enjoy. This belief takes away agency, given that there are certainly a lot more other options than the one our belief dictates. 

It is often not easy to tell whether a given belief is agency-taking or agency-giving. Just like with everything in self-reflection, we are masters of twisting what we see in ourselves to fit into a nicer story. There are two useful markers that can help. 

First, agency-giving beliefs usually touch something uncomfortable within us. They are usually asking us to contend with some inner truths that often feel best left unquestioned. After all, more agency means more uncertainty. Struggle and pain often accompanies shifting toward an agency-giving belief. If it’s easy, we’re probably moving the other way.

Second, agency-giving beliefs tend to lead to novel outcomes. If we feel like we’re trying to change our beliefs toward more agency, yet the outcomes remain the same, we are probably deluding ourselves. The lack of novel outcomes is a sure sign of an agency-taking belief taking hold.

Agency-giving beliefs don’t necessarily contain answers to hard questions. In themselves, they will not make us fit or find us a better job. However, they will help us start thinking about new possibilities and sharpen our sense of interesting opportunities. They will shift our agency toward us. We will still need to work – even harder than before – to properly recognize the possibilities and capitalize on those opportunities.

But at least we will have the shot at them – something that’s simply inaccessible behind the veil of agency-taking beliefs.

To illustrate the concept of agency-taking vs. agency-giving beliefs in the context of the essay, here are five pairs of emojis that could serve as symbolic representations:

1. 🚫🏃‍♂️ vs. 🏋️‍♂️💡
   - The first pair symbolizes the agency-taking belief that one cannot exercise due to barriers (🚫) vs. the agency-giving belief that exercising can be approached with new, manageable ideas (💡).

2. 💼😞 vs. 🌈👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
   - This set represents the belief that staying in an unenjoyable job is the only way to support a family (💼😞) vs. the belief in a spectrum of possibilities (🌈) for family support.

3. 🛌🔄 vs. 🚀🆕
   - Here, the emojis convey staying in comfort and repetition (🛌🔄) vs. embarking on new, challenging journeys (🚀🆕) that lead to novel outcomes.

4. 🙈⛓ vs. 🤺💥
   - This pair contrasts avoiding confronting uncomfortable truths (🙈⛓) with facing challenges head-on (🤺) to break free from constraints (💥).

5. 🚷🔁 vs. 🔑🌟
   - Lastly, the belief that one is stuck in unchanging, limiting circumstances (🚷🔁) vs. the belief that one has the key (🔑) to unlocking new, bright opportunities (🌟).

These pairs aim to visually encapsulate the dichotomy between beliefs that limit personal growth and empowerment versus those that foster it, aligning with the themes of the essay on self-reflection and personal agency.
