A company has a product that is still gaining new customers but has some issues around a challenging setup experience, ongoing debugging and configuration challenges, and some reliability and scaling problems. 

We want to pause work on new features and focus on making the overall experience smooth, scalable, reliable. What is a good term or phrase that captures all of those nuances? It can be English or non-English

The term you're looking for is "Technical Debt Repayment" or simply "Tech Debt Repayment". 

Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (and potentially limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. 

The metaphor is akin to financial debt, in the sense that it can be beneficial in the short term to allow for rapid progress, but like financial debt, the "interest" increases over time in the form of more work and resources needed to address the debt. When it's not properly managed, technical debt can lead to significant future expenses, complexity, and even complete project failure. 

In your scenario, the setup issues, debugging, configuration challenges, and reliability and scaling problems could all be considered technical debt that the company has accrued over time. The decision to pause work on new features to focus on resolving these issues is essentially a move to "repay" that technical debt.

Also related are the terms "Refactoring" and "Software Maintenance", though they're a bit narrower and don't cover all the nuances you mentioned. Refactoring refers to changing and improving the internal structure of software without changing its external behavior, while software maintenance refers to the activities required to keep a software system functional and up-to-date after it has been delivered to the user. Both of these activities are key components of technical debt repayment.

Those are great terms for describing the work. I'd love for something that captures the impact on customers. Like, what is a term that concisely captures why *customers* should care about this sort of work? What's the value to them?

"Customer Experience Optimization" could be a good term to capture the work from the customers' perspective. This phrase conveys that the company is focused on improving every aspect of the customer's interaction with the product, from setup to reliability, and underlines the idea that the aim of the work is to make the product more useful, reliable and enjoyable for the user.

"User Journey Enhancement" is another similar term that emphasizes the improvement of the entire experience of the user, from beginning to end. It suggests that the company wants to make sure that every interaction the customer has with the product is as smooth and effortless as possible.

These terms would help communicate to your customers that the goal of the work is to improve their experience with the product. They suggest that the company cares about the user's perspective and is actively investing resources in making sure that their experience is the best it can be. They also hint that any short-term disruption or lack of new features is part of a long-term strategy aimed at delivering a better product overall.

Are there 1 or 2 word phrases that capture some of the same idea, even if with a bit less detail?

### Assistant - 2023-08-01 16:03:42

Certainly, here are a few shorter terms that could still capture the essence of the concept:

1. "Optimization" - This single-word term can imply both the improvement of underlying technology and the enhancement of the user experience. It conveys the idea of making everything better, more efficient, and more effective.

2. "Refinement" - This term implies a focus on improvement, particularly in terms of polishing and enhancing an existing product to remove rough edges and improve the overall quality.

3. "Enhancement" - This term generally implies an improvement or augmentation, and could be used to suggest that the company is working to enhance the customer experience.

4. "Streamlining" - This term implies the removal of unnecessary complexity, and could be used to suggest that the company is working to make the product easier and more straightforward to use.

5. "Polishing" - This term indicates making something better by refining or perfecting it. It implies the last stage of a process, giving something the final touches to improve its appearance or functionality. 

Please note that these are somewhat more ambiguous and would likely need to be used in context or with additional explanation to fully convey the desired message to customers.
