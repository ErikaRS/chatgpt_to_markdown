This is an email from someone with whom I'm "friendish", a former best friend who is now just an acquaintance. Compose a response that is friendly, polite, and warm. Clearly mark areas where I should add personal details. 

Thank you, Erika!

I did have a wonderful birthday. We went to La Conner and did some shopping and went out to lunch. 

Matthew is growing. He started walking in February and just learned how to climb up onto the couch on my birthday! I will have to be extra watchful now because he doesnâ€™t know how to get off yet.

Jason is doing well and both of us still work at EvCC. His position is online part of the time, so it is nice to have him home. 

We moved to Marysville last September and are renting a duplex until we can buy something together. It is near Mom and Dadâ€™s house, so it is nice to hang out with the and have dinner together occasionally. 

Dad is retired and Mom is still working at the library. Sometimes we walk to the library to visit while she is there in the mornings.

Happy Birthday to you, too! Did you do anything special for your birthday? I am happy that we are still friends after all of these years. 

How are you and your family doing? Do you have any fun outings planned this year?

Hi Erika,

It's so great to hear from you, and I'm glad you had a wonderful birthday celebration in La Conner! It sounds like you had a lovely time shopping and going out for lunch.

It's amazing how quickly kids grow up, isn't it? I'm happy to hear that Matthew is walking and learning new skills. I can only imagine how much more watchful you'll have to be now that he's able to climb onto the couch. Just wait until he figures out how to get down on his own â€“ then you'll really have your hands full!

It's nice that both you and Jason are still working at EvCC and that he gets to work from home part-time. I'm sure that helps with managing family life. Your move to Marysville sounds like it was a great decision, especially since you're closer to your parents. It must be so lovely to have dinners and visits with them more often.

As for my birthday, I had a fantastic time! [Add personal details about your birthday celebration here]. I'm truly grateful for the wonderful people in my life, including you. It's always heartwarming to know that we've maintained our friendship over the years.

My family and I are doing well. [Add personal details about your family and their activities here]. As for fun outings, we have a few things planned for this year. [Add details about any planned outings or trips].

I'd love to catch up with you more. Maybe we could arrange a video chat or even a get-together sometime soon. Let me know if you'd be up for that! 

Take care, and please give my best to Jason, Matthew, and your parents.

Warmly,

[Your Name]
