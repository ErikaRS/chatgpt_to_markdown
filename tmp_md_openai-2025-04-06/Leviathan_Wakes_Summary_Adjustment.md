Maintaining my overall style, add 1-2 sentences about the plot to these notes about Leviathan Wakes by James Corey

First off, this book is just straight up good writing. The imagery (even when it was more gruesome than I prefer), the characterization, the plot development and twists, the moral reflections: this is legit literature.

That said while I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the rest, I personally dropped a star because I don't love the body horror. It isn't constant, but it is a core part of the book.

*Leviathan Wakes* by James S.A. Corey is a compelling blend of noir detective mystery and space opera. Set in a future where humanity has colonized the solar system, the novel follows two very different men—an idealistic ship captain and a jaded detective—who are drawn into the same harrowing mystery, one that threatens not just their lives but the fate of humanity itself.  

This book is, quite simply, masterfully written. The imagery—vivid and often unsettling—the depth of characterization, the expertly paced plot twists, and the thoughtful moral dilemmas elevate it beyond standard genre fiction. This is storytelling at its finest, gripping from the first page to the last.  

That said, while I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am eager to continue the series, I personally had to dock a star due to the body horror. It’s not omnipresent, but when it appears, it’s visceral and deeply unsettling—an integral but intense aspect of the story.
