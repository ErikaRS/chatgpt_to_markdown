Plan a menu for a Easter brunch for 14 people including one vegetarian and one person who avoids sugar. The hosts are willing to do some amount of cooking but not spend forever on it.

For your Easter brunch for 14 people, keeping in mind the dietary restrictions, I suggest a menu that balances ease of preparation with the needs of your guests, including the vegetarian and the person avoiding sugar. The idea is to offer dishes that are largely suitable for everyone, with minor adjustments to accommodate dietary restrictions without requiring entirely separate meals. Here’s a thoughtfully planned menu:

### Main Dishes:
1. **Quiche Lorraine & Vegetarian Quiche**: Prepare two types of quiche—one traditional Quiche Lorraine with bacon for the meat-eaters, and a vegetarian quiche filled with spinach, mushrooms, and cheese. Use store-bought pastry shells to save time.

2. **Herb-Roasted Turkey Breast**: A lean, sugar-free option that's easy to prepare and can be served cold or warm. It’s a crowd-pleaser and fits well with the brunch theme.

3. **Baked Ham**: Consider a naturally sweetened glaze (using fruit juices like apple or orange) for those avoiding refined sugars. Offer a small portion without the glaze for the person avoiding sugar.

### Sides:
1. **Spring Vegetable Medley**: A mix of asparagus, carrots, and green beans roasted with olive oil, salt, and pepper. This is a colorful, healthy, and easy side that everyone can enjoy.

2. **Cheese and Fruit Platter**: Assortment of cheeses (include some plant-based options) alongside fresh fruit like grapes, berries, and sliced apples. This requires no cooking and caters to all guests.

3. **Deviled Eggs**: A classic and simple side that's popular at brunches. For the person avoiding sugar, ensure the mayonnaise and mustard used are sugar-free.

### Salads:
1. **Mixed Green Salad with Vinaigrette**: Offer a simple mixed green salad with a variety of dressings on the side, including a basic olive oil and vinegar option for a sugar-free dressing.

2. **Potato Salad**: Make a traditional potato salad and consider using a light, yogurt-based dressing for the vegetarian option. Check condiments for added sugars for your guest avoiding sugar.

### Breads:
1. **Assorted Bread Basket**: Include a variety of breads, like whole wheat, sourdough, and a gluten-free option. Serve with butter, jam (sugar-free jam available), and a plant-based spread.

### Desserts:
1. **Fruit Salad**: A mix of seasonal fruits, dressed with a splash of lemon or lime juice and fresh mint. This is refreshing and naturally sweet without added sugar.

2. **Easter-themed Sugar-free Cake**: Bake or buy a cake that uses sugar substitutes suitable for the guest avoiding sugar. There are many recipes online that use ingredients like stevia or erythritol.

3. **Hot Cross Buns**: Offer traditional hot cross buns for those who enjoy them, and perhaps find a sugar-free recipe or version for the guest avoiding sugar.

### Beverages:
- **Coffee and Tea**: With options for milk, almond milk, and sugar substitutes.
- **Mimosas & Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Juice**: Allow guests to choose their preference, with a non-alcoholic option for those who don't drink or are avoiding sugar.
- **Water Infusions**: Serve water infused with fruits like lemon, lime, cucumber, or berries for a refreshing and decorative touch.

This menu is designed to offer a variety of flavors and options, ensuring that there’s something for everyone without requiring the hosts to spend excessive time in the kitchen. By preparing some items ahead of time and choosing simple yet delicious dishes, you can enjoy the celebration as much as your guests.
