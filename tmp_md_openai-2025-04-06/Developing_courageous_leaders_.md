These are my notes for the Introduction to Brene Brown's _Dare to Lead_. Given the notes and your understanding of the book, summarize the key points in 5-10 bullet points. Less is more.

In this book, Brown consolidates new and previous research on leadership to present an actionable set of skills to train brave leaders who build courageous cultures. Leaders are not just those with formal leadership roles but "anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential."

Brave leaders and courageous cultures are what we need to be successful in a complex, rapidly changing environment with seemingly intractable problems. Without bravery we avoid tough conversations, spend time managing problematic reactive behaviors, see trust diminish, avoid bold ideas and smart risks, get stuck, shame and blame, opt out of diversity and inclusion conversations, rush into ineffective solutions, have organizational values that are merely aspirational, and let perfectionism and fear keep us from growing. 

To counter this, you need daring leadership. You need courage. Fortunately, courage can be taught. For courage you need to rumble with vulnerability. You need to embrace the suck. You need to live into your values, brave trust, and learn to rise. The foundational skill is being willing to rumble in vulnerability — to show up with an open heart and mind. Self awareness and self love allow you to respond to your fear without putting up the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors we use to armor ourselves. 

You need to build courage into teams and organizations. Brave work, tough conversations, and whole hearts are the expectation. Armor is not rewarded. This requires caring for and being connected to the people you lead. This is the minimum threshold we owe them. We must guard the spaces where they can remove their armor. If we can't do this, if we reward blaming, shaming, cynicism, perfectionism, or emotional stoicism, then we can't expect innovation. This means we have to create cultures that make going without armor safe for everyone regardless of race, class, sex, gender, or other dimensions. To create courage, we need to take on the messy, human work of talking about fears, feelings, and scarcity.

Summarize 3-10 key points from this text. One of them should be a surprising "ah hah!" moment:

If we are brave enough, if we are daring enough to put ourselves out there, we will fail. Vulnerability is having the courage to show up when you can't control the outcome. Vulnerability, comes from a place of action. 

Taking action may open you to hurtful comments, so you need to remember to pay attention to the opinion of those who matter most to you, the people who care deeply about you and who are also willing to give you critical feedback when you need it. One tool for identifying these people is to take a one inch by 1 in piece of paper and write down the name of people whose opinions really matter. Having limited space requires you to edit. 

The chapter goes into 6 myths around vulnerability and why they are false. 
- Myth: Vulnerability is a weakness. Truth: Vulnerability is the feeling that people have during any time of uncertainty. 
- Myth:  Some people just do not do vulnerability. Truth: Everyone feels vulnerable at times. It is a matter of whether or not people engage with that vulnerability or try to avoid it.
- Myth: You can go it alone. Truth: humans are wired for connection. We need to depend on others and have others depend on us. 
- Myth: You can engineer out uncertainty and discomfort to reduce vulnerability. Truth: It is true that you can design a way many sources of *systemic* uncertainty and vulnerability, these are technical vulnerabilities like in security systems. However, that is not the same as the personal vulnerability of things such as having hard conversations with people you lead. 
- Myth:Trust needs to come before vulnerability. Truth: Both trust and vulnerability build on each other. Small acts of vulnerability build up trust over time. Without vulnerability, it is hard to build up trust. That does not mean trusting people unconditionally. Brown uses the metaphor of a marble jar. Some people, in the small everyday moments that build trust, do things that add marbles to their jar. Those with a full jar, who you've built up strong relationships with over time, are the ones that you should trust it in moments of large vulnerability. Others by their actions, failed to put marbles in the jar or even cause marbles to be spilled out. 
- Myth: Vulnerability is the same as disclosure. Truth: Disclosure can be appropriate or inappropriate depending on the intentions and expectations of the person making the disclosure. Vulnerability can also be shown without somebody making large personal disclosures. Vulnerability often means creating a safe container for *other people* to feel open and safe in the conversation, not dominating the conversation with your own feelings. Another way to put it is that embracing vulnerability means setting up the conditions for psychological safety, so that people feel comfortable being vulnerable in their work environment. This is the foundation on which creativity and innovation are built.  It may be appropriate to share within boundaries during a moment of vulnerability, but the person sharing should interrogate themselves for stealth intentions and stealth expectations that undermine the purpose of sharing.

One question leaders can ask their team is, "What does support from me look like?"

Humans are feeling creatures. To feel is to be vulnerable. Vulnerability and feeling make up the cornerstone of courage building. They are the foundation of creativity and innovation. Creativity and innovation require putting yourself out there without knowing the results, the very definition of a vulnerable situation

5. Trust and vulnerability build on each other through small acts, with the "marble jar" metaphor representing the accumulation of trust.
6. Vulnerability is not the same as disclosure; it involves creating a safe environment for others to feel open and comfortable in conversations.
7. "Ah hah!" moment: Embracing vulnerability sets up conditions for psychological safety, which is the foundation for creativity and innovation in a work environment.
8. Leaders can ask their team, "What does support from me look like?" to better understand and address their needs.
9. Feelings and vulnerability form the cornerstone of courage-building, essential for creativity and innovation.

Summarize 3-10 key points from this text. One should be a surprising, "ah hah!" moment:
Reading this chapter is somewhat like a river. It's hard to hold to any particular thread but you can feel the shape of it.

When you are called to have courage, it can be a challenge not to respond with fear. However, whether we are on the giving end or the receiving end, we must remember that **Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind.** Half truths, vague statements, talking about people can feel easier, but they are all unkind. 

When receiving clear feedback, you don't have to respond to it right away. Instead you can **circle back**, in 10 minutes, in an hour, the next day. The important thing is to set a time and then actually do it. The time in between can be used for destressing or for thinking about the commitments you want to make in response to the challenging conversation.

When you take the time away from the conversation, you may gain insight. One form of insight is seeing how your behavior is driven by fear. Fear leads us to assemble our armor. We go from feeling that we're not enough to fearing that others will think less of us to keeping it secret to blaming them and their issues to feeling self justified for our defensive behaviors. "People think it's a long walk from 'I'm not enough' to 'I'm better than them,' but it's actually just standing still. In the exact same place. In fear.

Facing our fears is a form a treasure hunting. The treasure we seek may be less fear, less scarcity, less anxiety, more working together. We need to enter the "cave" of our fear and understand what it is that we're not seeing.

One tool that can make these conversations easier is giving ourselves **permission slips**. Individuals write down one thing they give themselves permission to do or feel in the meeting and share it. It's a combination of setting an intention (e.g., to be present) and asking yourself to commit to a behavior.

As an aside, in the example running through the chapter of Brown's challenges with time management, she shared a nice format for meeting minutes:
1. One person captures the minutes, but others are responsible for noting items that should be captured in the minutes
2. The minutes needn't be exhaustive. They are as simple as
    - Date: 
    - Meeting intention:
    - Attendees:
    - Key decisions:
    - Tasks and ownership:
3. Meetings end 5 minutes early to review and agree on the minutes
4. The minutes are sent to a relevant Slack channel before everyone leaves the room so sharing doesn't become extra work

There's also an aside on the importance of being both optimistic and realistic and not to stereotype people into one bucket. Being stereotyped into the "realistic" bucket can stifle creativity. Being stereotyped into the "optimistic" bucket can cost you credibility and trust. Quoting Admiral Jim Stockdale in *Good to Great*, "You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end — which you can never afford to lose — with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be." You need gritty faith and gritty facts, and everyone must be responsible for both. 

Approaching rumbles with courage requires asking "What's my part?" It turns out that each of us always has some part to play in a group challenge, even if it was just not speaking up or staying curious. 

It takes courage to serve others. Brown shares a story of DeDe Halfhill on the importance of using relatable words like "lonely" instead of "disconnected" when talking to people about their challenges. **Real language is more likely to connect.** The people you connect with may come to you with their problems. You don't need to know how to solve their problems to help them. You can let them know that you are a fellow traveler on this journey, not a mapmaker. You can help them get professional help when needed, but you can also be willing to travel along side them. 

Our language has become sanitized, and we're afraid to use words like loneliness, empathy, compassion, belonging, feeling, fear, confidence, kindness, friendliness, mercy, and love in professional contexts. However, sanitizing our language does not get rid of these emotions or the problems that are caused when they are not acknowledged. It just decreases our comfort with expressing and holding space for these emotions. 

All of this can seem like it would take too much time, too much effort. However, remember that you don't have to solve the problems (although you may have to set boundaries around inappropriate behaviors). You can work on container-building and defining a place where people can express their hard emotions. You also can remember that if these feelings are not attended too, they will manifest as unproductive and ineffective behaviors. Better make space for them directly. And when it feels like you're not making progress, make space. Stop talking and when they speak, really listen. 

### Assistant - 2023-04-12 19:45:26

1. "Ah hah!" moment: Sanitized language may seem professional, but using real, relatable words like "loneliness" or "compassion" helps establish genuine connections and fosters understanding.
2. Clear communication is kind, while vague statements and half-truths are unkind. Clarity helps prevent misunderstandings and fosters trust.
3. During difficult conversations, it's okay to take a break and circle back later, allowing time to process and reflect on the feedback.
4. Recognizing our fears and understanding their role in our behavior can help us break free from defensive responses.
5. Permission slips are a tool to set intentions and commit to behaviors during challenging discussions.
6. An efficient meeting minutes format can help streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page.
7. Balancing optimism and realism is essential for both creativity and credibility, as both gritty faith and gritty facts are needed.
8. Asking "What's my part?" helps us recognize our role in group challenges and promotes personal accountability.
9. Offering support doesn't require solving others' problems, but rather being a fellow traveler on their journey and connecting with them.
10. Making space for difficult emotions in professional contexts can prevent unproductive behaviors and promote healthier communication.

Summarize 3-10 key points from this text. One should be a surprising, "ah hah!" moment:

This was a massive chapter which went over 15 pairs of armored behaviors and their vulnerable counterparts. When I'm doing the full notes I should go through and left out those pairs and some key points from them. The common theme though, is that although armored leadership can feel like be more natural choice, vulnerable leadership achieves better outcomes. Maybe harder in the moment, but over time it is easier because it builds up trust, provides clear and kind feedback, and saves all the energy that it takes to manage armored behaviors.

1. The common theme in the 15 pairs of armored and daring leadership is that vulnerable leadership achieves better outcomes by building trust, providing clear and kind feedback, and saving energy otherwise wasted on managing armored behaviors.
   Ah-hah! moment: Armored leadership may feel like the more natural choice, but vulnerable leadership is more effective in the long run.

2. Using power with, power to, and power within: These different types of power foster collaboration, give agency, and acknowledge potential, while recognizing differences and respecting others.

3. "Paint done for me" - a way to ensure alignment on expectations by clearly defining the desired outcome.

4. Cultivating commitment and shared purpose through the TASC (The Accountability and Success Checklist) framework: Task, Authority, Set up for Success, and Checklist, ensuring that responsibilities are clear, and individuals are set up to succeed.

5. Practicing gratitude and celebrating milestones and victories helps combat working from scarcity and squandering opportunities for joy and recognition.

6. Modeling clarity, kindness, and hope is a daring leadership approach that counters hiding behind cynicism.

7. Daring leaders use power with, power to, and power within, while armored leaders tend to use power over others.

8. Cultivating a culture of belonging, inclusivity, and diverse perspectives is a key element of daring leadership, as opposed to tolerating discrimination, echo chambers, and a "fitting in" culture.

9. Rewarding exhaustion as a status symbol and attaching productivity to self-worth is an armored leadership behavior, while daring leaders model and support rest, play, and recovery.

10. Daring leaders lead from the heart, while armored leaders lead from hurt, demonstrating the importance of empathy and understanding in effective leadership.

Summarize 3-10 key points from this text. One should be a surprising, "ah hah!" moment. Try to keep the original tone:

This section discusses what shame is and how it differs from other negative feelings such as guilt. It goes into detail about how empathy can be used as a tool to defeat shame. Another critical tool for fighting against shame is self compassion.

Shame is the "never good enough" emotion.  We all have shame. We're all afraid to talk about shame. But the less we talk about shame, the more control it has over our lives. 

- [Q] Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love, belonging, and connection.

Guilt = I did something bad.
Shame = I am bad.
Humiliation = I don't deserve this
Embarrassment = A fleeting feeling. I am not glad I didn't this but it doesn't define me. 

Shame shows up at work as perfectionism, favoritism, gossiping, back-channeling, comparison, self-worth tied to productivity, harassment, discrimination, power over, bullying, blaming, teasing, cover-ups. Symptoms of a shame driven culture include
- Shame is systemic
- Complicity is part of the culture
- Money and power trump ethics
- Accountability is dead
- Control and fear are management tools
- There's a trail of devastation and pain

The best tools for defeating shame are empathy and self-compassion. 

- [Q] Empathy is not connecting to an experience, it's connecting to the emotions that underpin an experience.

Empathy says, "Yes, this hurts. Yes, this is a big deal. Yes, this sucks." It does *not* focus on making things better. It does not bring in comparative suffering ("if you think that's bad..."). 

Key empathy skills include:
- Perspective taking
- Being nonjudgmental
- Understanding another person's feelings
- Communicating your understandings of that person's feelings
- Paying attention, neither minimizing nor exaggerating emotions

To become resilient to shame we must recognize shame and understand its triggers , zoom out to see the bigger picture, reach out to others, and speak about shame.

1. Ah-hah! moment: Shame is the "never good enough" emotion, and the less we talk about it, the more control it has over our lives.

2. Shame differs from guilt, humiliation, and embarrassment: guilt is about doing something bad, humiliation is about not deserving something, and embarrassment is a fleeting feeling that doesn't define us.

3. Shame shows up in the workplace as perfectionism, favoritism, gossiping, back-channeling, comparison, self-worth tied to productivity, harassment, discrimination, power over, bullying, blaming, teasing, and cover-ups.

4. Symptoms of a shame-driven culture include systemic shame, complicity, money and power trumping ethics, lack of accountability, control and fear as management tools, and a trail of devastation and pain.

5. Empathy and self-compassion are the best tools for defeating shame.

6. Empathy is about connecting to the emotions that underpin an experience, not the experience itself.

7. Key empathy skills include perspective-taking, being nonjudgmental, understanding another person's feelings, communicating your understanding of their feelings, and paying attention without minimizing or exaggerating emotions.

8. To become resilient to shame, one must recognize shame and understand its triggers, zoom out to see the bigger picture, reach out to others, and speak about shame.

Summarize 3-10 key points from this text. Less is more. One should be a surprising, "ah hah!" moment. Try to keep the original tone:

How do we allow ourselves to be vulnerable? How do we give ourselves the space to rumble? Two key tools are curiosity and grounded confidence. 

- [Q] Grounded Confidence = Rumble Skills + Curiosity + Practice

Curiosity is being actively open to learning more. It generally does not occur in a vacuum, but built on a foundation of partial knowledge. To be curious, you need to have enough knowledge to know that there's more to learn. 

Grounded confidence is the idea that if you are confident in your own, worth, your own values, your own belief, then you can more easily enter into vulnerability with others. This confidence cannot just be bluster or bravado. It needs to be built on a solid foundation of who you are.

Rumble starters and questions:
1. The story I make up... 
2. I'm curious about...
3. Tell me more.
4. That's not my experience (instead of "You're wrong about...")
5. I'm wondering...
6. Help me understand...
7. Walk me through...
8. We're both dug in. Tell me about your passion around this.
9. Tell me why this doesn't fit/work for you.
10. I'm working from that assumptions — what about you?
11. What problem are we trying to solve

### Assistant - 2023-04-12 19:51:14

1. Ah-hah! moment: Grounded Confidence = Rumble Skills + Curiosity + Practice.

2. Curiosity, a key tool for vulnerability, is being actively open to learning more and requires a foundation of partial knowledge.

3. Grounded confidence, another key tool, is built on a solid foundation of self-worth, values, and beliefs, allowing for easier vulnerability with others.

4. Rumble starters and questions can help navigate vulnerability and include phrases like "The story I make up...", "I'm curious about...", "Tell me more.", "That's not my experience.", "I'm wondering...", "Help me understand...", "Walk me through...", "We're both dug in. Tell me about your passion around this.", "Tell me why this doesn't fit/work for you.", and "I'm working from these assumptions — what about you?".

Summarize 3-10 key points from this text. Less is more. One should be a surprising, "ah hah!" moment. Try to keep the original tone:

Our values are what ground us, especially in the moments where cynics and critics try to bring us to our knees.
- [Q] A *value* is a way of being or believing that we hold most important.

Living into our values means practicing them, not just professing them. To do this, we need to understand what our values are. However, this is hard. We don't have one set of values for work and one for personal life. We have one set of values. And while there are many positive qualities we aspire to, when we take the time to whittle the list down to 2, we see that they are at the heart of what we hold most sacred.

- Step One: Name our values
    - For me, I ended up whittling down to **Belonging** and **Usefulness**. 
    - While there are many values on the list of candidates that are very important to me and which I strive to live too, when I ask myself *why* I value those, it generally comes back to those two.
    - [Q] Our values should be crystallized in our minds, so infallible, so precise and clear and unassailable that they don't feel like a choice — they are simply a definition of who we are in our lives. 
- Step Two: Taking values from BS to behavior
    - People are much more likely to talk their values than they are to practice them
    - To make values tangible, we must name 3-4 behaviors that support our values and three or four "slippery behaviors" that we're tempted to do even though they're counter to our values.
    - Support behaviors
        - Taking the time to reach out to others, especially when it feels awkward
        - Choosing what's valuable over what's easy
        - Taking the time to show up and create spaces where others can show up
    - Slippery behaviors
        - Letting it be someone else's problem
        - Letting cleverness overcome my desire to pull people in
        - Getting too busy to do what's useful or connection-creating
- Step Three: Create space for empathy and self-compassion
    - Don't be silent about the hard things
    - Thing about the systemic factors that may make things harder for some people; don't opt out of conversations about race
    - Listen, heard. "I see you. I hear you. I don't have all the answer, but I'm going to keep listening and asking questions."
    - Make our values our priorities. Build a support network to make this happen. 
    - Look for early warning indicators that you're living outside your values and signs that you're living in them.

The chapter also has a good discussion of how to give feedback. It starts by being in the right mindset: be ready to sit next to someone, not across from them. Then, be ready to put the problem in front of us, where we're working on mutual understanding, rather than  between us where it becomes an "us vs them" issue. Be ready to listen, ask questions, and accept that you may not understand the issue. Be ready to acknowledge what someone does well and recognize their strengths, not just pick apart mistakes. Understand how those strengths can help them overcome their challenges. Be ready to hold people accountable without shaming and blaming and while owning your own part in contributing to the situation. Be ready to thank people for their efforts, not just criticize. Be ready to talk about growth and opportunity. Be ready to model the vulnerability and openness you expect others to demonstrate. Think carefully about how you want to show up in the conversation and be true to your values.

The flip side of this is that you also need to stay aligned with your values when receiving feedback, even if the person giving it is not great at the job. Mastery requires feedback, so we should welcome it. Identify a method for accepting tough feedback that aligns with your values. For Brene it is "I'm brave enough to listen." For me, it might be "This will help me be more useful." It's also important to remember to take what works and leave the rest and to remember that the person giving feedback is probably doing so before they care.  This does not mean you need to accept all feedback. Listen, integrate it, and reflect it back. Acknowledge to the other person when it is hard but also be willing to dig into it.

It's important not just to know your own values but also to know the values of others. You don't really know people until you know their values. 

Having abstract values is not enough. You also need to know how to operationalize them. Operationalizing values, for either an organization or a person, means identifying concrete values that you are held accountable for demonstrating. These should be concrete enough that you can evaluate your success at demonstrating those values. This helps you live into your values and helps drive productive, consistent decision making You want to be thoughtful and decisive, not one or the other. "When you have a value printed on posters hanging in the halls but you don't dig into the behaviors that support it and teach people those behaviors, you're in BS territory. It starts to corrode trust."

One common call when it comes to values is assuming positive intent. Brene Brown posits that that is not enough. You need to to combine this with boundaries and integrtity. Living BIG (boundaries, integrity, and generosity) provides a sustainable way of assuming positive intent without letting others run roughshod all over you. Ask yourself, "What boundaries need to be in place for me to be in my integrity and generously with my assumptions about the intentions, words, and actions of others?" Work with the assumption that people are doing the best they can. It might not always be true, but things generally turn out better when you start from that assumption. 

We can assume positive intent and still expect people to set goals, grow, and change. Rather, positive intent is a "commitment to stop respecting and evaluating people based solely on what we think they should accomplish, and start respecting them for who they are and holding them accountable for what they're actually doing."

Summarize 3-10 key points from this text. Less is more. One should be a surprising, "ah hah!" moment. Try to keep the original tone:

If people feel that their trustworthiness is being questioned, they will shut down. Brown takes a page from Charles Feltman and defines trust as "choosing to risk making something you value vulnerable to another person's actions." Distrust means "what is important to me is not safe with this person in this situation (or any situation)."

Talking about trust is hard but it is critical to have these conversations directly. If we don't do this, we waste energy. Trust holds our teams together and makes them more effective. Trust is not a soft skill. It is a must-have that leads to sustainable, measurable, and tangible positive results. 

However, if we treat trust as something abstract, it will be too hard to point to. We need to point to specific behaviors and identify where a breach of trust lies. "The more exact we can be, the more likely it is that people can hear us, that we can give feedback on behavior and stay away from character, and that we can support real change."

The BRAVING Inventory is a rumble tool that guides us through conversations about trust. The elements are:
- Boundaries: You respect my boundaries. When they aren't clear, you ask. You're willing to say no.
- Reliability: You do what you say. You are aware of your competencies and limitations so you don't over promise. 
- Accountability: You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends.
- Vault: You don't share information or experiences that are not yours to share. You keep the confidences of others. 
- Integrity: You choose courage over comfort. You practice your values.
- Non-judgment: We can each ask for what we need and talk about how we feel without judgment.
- Generosity: You extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others. 

Operationalize it! Don't just consider these factors in the abstract. Develop one to two observable behaviors for each element that are specific to your culture. 

Remember that we cannot demand trust. Trust is built up in many small actions over time. 

Self trust is just as important as trusting others. We can apply the braving inventory to ourselves and making sure that we are giving ourselves the same elements we give others.

Summarize 3-10 key points from this text. Less is more. One should be a surprising, "ah hah!" moment. Try to keep the original tone:

If you know rising skills, you are more likely to exhibit courageous behavior because you know how to get back up. It's much more difficult to learn how to get up when you're already on the ground. You should expect to fall and be ready for that. However, it's important to go beyond "fail fast" as an empty slogan. You need to make sure people have techniques for putting these skills into practice. 

This is the purpose of the Learning to Rise process. The process consists of three parts: the reckoning, the rumble, and the revolution. The goal of this process is to walk into our story and own it. This allows us to write our own ending. 


The reckoning is when we recognize that we are in the grip of some emotion, often signaled by our bodies. Then we get curious about it. We are so often tempted to ignore our emotions, but it's much more productive to recognize our emotions and then work to understand what's really going on. People have many different strategies for ignoring their feeling. Avoid those. Once you've recognized the emotion, take some deep, slow breaths to create a sense of calm. 

Next, we rumble. In the absence of data, we make up stories. We love the "Aha! I solved it!" sense that a story gives us in the face of incomplete data. However, we have to recognize that these stories are rarely correct. One particular skill is to separate your reality from your reactions using prompts like, "The story I'm telling myself...". Then we can recognize that this first story is nearly always a "shitty/stormy first draft". Fear fills in the gaps. SFDs are a part of life, but we can create the time, space, and safety for people to reality check those drafts. We also need to be aware that these SFDs are often confabulations: lies *honestly* told. We can recognize our SFDs by taking time to reflect on our emotions, our body, our thinking our beliefs, our actions, and how they all contribute to the story we are making up. Writing down the SFD gives us the power to revise and retire it in favor of something better.

Questions to ask yourself when in the midst of a rumble:
- What more do I need to learn and understand about the situation? What do I know objectively? What assumptions am I making?
- What more do I need to learn and understand about other people in the story? What additional information do I need? What questions or clarifications might help?
- What more do I need to learn and understand about myself? What's underneath my response? What am I really feeling? What part did I play?

The difference between the story we make up and the underlying truth is where we acquire wisdom and experience and learning. 

You can apply the rumble process as a group where a group creates a safe environment for creating shitty first drafts and curiously explores what they tell us. Then the group gathers new information and learns from the delta. Finally, they act on these learnings and integrate them into their culture. 

Finally, we get to the revolution. We choose authenticity and worthiness over the easy path of criticism, cynicism, and fear. We must follow our personal call to courage and not let others define success for us. If we can do this as an organization, then we'll be able to be successful. Make time for joy and meaning because they are not distractions to achievement. They are core tools for helping you achieve.
