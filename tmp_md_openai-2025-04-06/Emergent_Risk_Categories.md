Acute risks are risks where the risk is low but the impact severe when it occurs. Everyday risks are more common but we generally know how to manage them them via norms and regulations. Then there are new areas of risk where the impact is diffuse and generally moderate but where we don't yet have well standardized norms. What is a good name for these sorts of risks?

You could refer to these types of risks as "Emergent Risks." This term encapsulates both the novelty of these risks and the uncertainty about their potential impacts and how to manage them. "Emergent" also conveys the idea that these risks are continuously evolving, which often characterizes risks associated with new technologies, changing societal norms, or shifting environmental conditions.

A more professional way of saying "passing the buck" might be "delegating responsibility", "diverting accountability", or "shifting responsibility." All of these phrases capture the essence of the original term but sound more formal and neutral in professional settings.

What's the complement to capping the upside but for the downside? Cap the downside doesn't sound right to me

### Assistant - 2023-07-03 19:06:20

You could say "limiting the downside", "mitigating the downside", or "minimizing the downside". These phrases refer to reducing the potential for negative outcomes, similar to how "capping the upside" refers to limiting the potential for positive outcomes.
