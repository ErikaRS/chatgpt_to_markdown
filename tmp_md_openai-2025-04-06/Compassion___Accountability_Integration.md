Here are my notes for a book. Given these ideas, draft a summary / review of the book. The overall tone should be informative, helpful, friendly, intelligent. My primary critiques of the book are that it seems a bit padded/redundant and that it seems more focused on teaching the value of compassion than on teaching people how to hold others accountable compassionately. The second part isn't a bad thing, but it's not what I was looking for in the book. My primary praise for the book is that it has some very strong core ideas. Both compassion and accountability are necessary. They are not opposites. They empower each other since both are required to allow people to be effective. Compassion is not solving problems for others, it's struggling with them, together. Compassionate accountability requires seeing other people as valuable, capable, and responsible. Conflict is a source of energy that can be used for drama or creativity. I compare this book to Radical Candor which is the better book overall. But what this book adds over that are the value/capability/responsibility model and the idea that conflict is a source of creative energy.

### Part I. The Big Idea: Compassionate Accountability

#### 1. The Evolution of Compassion
##### Contents
- Compassion’s Journey
    - Self-Compassion (before 2008)
    - Business Compassion (2008 to Present)
    - Inclusion Compassion (2017 to Present)
    - Pandemic Compassion (2020 to 2021)
    - The Solution: Compassionate Accountability

##### Notes
Discusses the different ways compassion has been been seen in the business world: as a personal practice, as a way of creating human-centered work environment, as an element of creating truly inclusive environments, and how compassion shifted from one extreme to another during the pandemic. 

Compassion is shown to be more than just tolerance, safety, caring, empathy, alleviation of suffering, kindness, nonviolence, or even inclusion. Rather, it's embracing that we are in this together. And to be effective compassion needs to include accountability. 
> Compassion without accountability doesn’t address the tough issues we are facing, nor does it acknowledge the inherent conflict when attempting to bring diverse viewpoints and skill sets together to solve big problems. Similarly, accountability without compassion results in toxic cultures that focus only on the endgame at the expense of people and relationships. 

#### 2. Compassion and Accountability Are Complementary
##### Contents
- The Difference between Accountability and Responsibility
    - Leaders Are Accountable to Others
    - Leaders Are Responsible for Their Behaviors (No More, No Less)
- The Consequences of Confusing Accountability and Responsibility
- What It Means to Hold People Accountable
- How Leaders Hold People Accountable
- Balance Is the Wrong Question
- Compassion Is about Struggling _With_
- What Is Compassionate Accountability?
- You Don’t Have to Choose or Compromise
- Main Points
##### Notes
###### Main points
- If we view compassion and accountability as opposites, we place them in competition with each other and have no choice but to choose a side or try to balance them.
- Balance is the wrong question. Compassion means “to suffer or struggle with.” Accountability is already embedded within compassion. Compassion requires accountability; they aren’t separate.
- Leaders no longer have to choose compassion or accountability, be a flip flopper, or engage in a tenuous balancing act between them. You can have both without compromising either.
- Compassionate Accountability can infuse every interaction and requires us to simultaneously affirm and uphold that people are valuable, capable, and responsible.

###### Other notable points
- Leaders are accountable, but they are not responsible for the behavior of others. Accountability is when you have to answer to someone else about an outcome. We are responsible for something when we are the ones who are supposed to create an outcome. When we take responsibility for the behavior of others we are "heroing" as Sue would put it. 
- Leaders hold other people accountable for their parts by: 
    - Clarifying and communicating, expectations, vision, goals
    - Giving feedback
    - Teaching and mentoring to build capacity
    - Helping people maintain focus
    - Connecting employee responsibilities to the broader company purpose
    - Offering affirmation, recognition, and support
    - Executing consequences
- When leaders confuse accountability and responsibility it results in low morale, confusion of roles, poor execution, ineffectiveness, and burnout. 
- "Compassion without accountability gets you nowhere. Accountability without compassion gets you alienated."
- Compassion isn't about taking away suffering. It's about struggling with. 

### Part II. The Model: The Compassion Mindset

#### 3. What Is the Compassion Mindset?
##### Contents
- Interactions, Cultures, and Brands
- What Is the Compassion Mindset?
- Assess Your Compassion Mindset
- Main Paints

##### Notes
###### Main points
- With Compassionate Accountability, leaders can reimagine their understanding and practice of compassion to include accountability without giving up either one. No drama, no compromises.
- Brand is driven by culture, which is driven by daily interactions. Leaders must become fluid with compassion in the small moments if they want to change the interactions that drive culture and create strong brands. 
- Compassion is the practice of demonstrating that people are valuable, capable, and responsible in every interaction. 
    - (Quoted from within the chapter)
    - *Practice* – Compassion is a behavioral skill set. The more we work at it, the better we get. This reinforces that compassion is a learnable skill. 
    - *Demonstrating* – Compassion is more than a feeling, concept, or principle. It must be observable through behavior. Unless we can all agree on observable behaviors, we can't measure or teach it, set goals around, or see if we are making progress.
    - *Valuable, capable, and responsible* –These three aspects of compassion are all necessary but not sufficient on their own. They work together and rely on each other. This reinforces that compassion is not in competition with accountability.
    - *In every interaction* – Every moment counts. Every conversation is an opportunity to be compassionate. 
- The compassion mindset is a decision and attitude that views the self and others as valuable, capable, and responsible. 
- The three switches of the compassion mindset are value, capability, and responsibility. Each one can be assessed through observable behaviors. When they are turned on, people can experience more connection, engagement, innovation, ownership, and loyalty and a thriving culture. 
- Survey your compassion mindset by identifying how strongly you embrace the six fundamental principles. 
    - (The principles, from the survey, not the main points)
    - People are unconditionally valuable and deserve to be respected 
    - Even if someone makes a mistake or fails to perform, they are still worthwhile as a person.
    - People are capable of positive change and contribution.
    - Under the right conditions, anyone can contribute. 
    - Pointing fingers gets us further away from a solution.
    - No matter what happened before, we share responsibility for what happens next. 

###### Other notable points
- Drama steals time and energy from what is important
- Compassion is the antidote to drama
- Brand is a lagging indicator of your culture. Culture, simply put, is the idea that "People like us do things like this." (Seth Godin). 

The three switches of compassion. We can see 
- value as innate (on) or conditional (off)
- capability as possible (on) or limited (off)
- responsibility as shared (on) or isloated (off)

##### Notes
###### Main points
- Turn on your capability switch with these five behaviors:
    - Seek first to understand.
    - Share ideas and resources to find the best solutions.
    - Invite people to be part of the solution.
    - Invest in each other’s success.
    - Turn failure into learning opportunities.


| Capability switch is off                              | Capability switch is on                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Seek for to be understood.                            | Seek first to understand.                                                  |
| Control and fight over resources (scarcity mindset.)  | Share resources (abundance mindset).                                       |
| Assume others can't or won't help solve the problem.  | Invite people to be part of the solution.                                  |
| Avoid investing in people.                            | Want more for your people than you want from them.                         |
| Mistakes are to be avoided. Failure is not an option. | Mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow. Failure is the best teacher. |

###### Other notable points 
- When the capability switch is off, we see barriers instead of opportunity.
- This prevents us from looking for the best solution and turns off creativity. 
- Closing communication gaps starts with asking employees what they need to do their jobs better, which may be different than what you think. 
- The goal is to build organizational capability to have good ideas. It doesn't matter who.
- Instead of rehashing the past, leaders can orient a team's curiosity to focus on how they want the future to look different. Get people to ask, "What could be different and better next time?"
- Other questions for turning failure into a learning opportunity:
    - Instead of asking "Who did it?" ask "What didn't work?"
    - Ask "What did we learn from this?"
    - Ask "What do we need to do to make amends for what happened?"
    - Ask "What can we do to increase our confidence going forward?"

| Use fear, intimidation, or shame to influence behaviors.                                                                                      | Use healthy, assertive communication around boundaries and commitments.                  |
| Approach conflicts as win-or-lose adversarial situations.                                                                                     | Engage in positive conflicts that create connection, trust, and ownership.               |
| Focus on self-preservation and self-promotion.                                                                                                | Keep focus on values and principles that unite people around a common purpose.           |

###### Other notable points
- We are each 100% responsible for our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, including what we do next. We're not responsible for those of others. 
- Isolated responsibility can look either like taking too much or like taking too little responsibility.
- Statements like "That really made me update" or "You disrespected me" or "I expected more from you, you let me down" or "If you do that again, I'll have no choice but to..." are all bids to avoid responsibility.
- Leaders need to own their feelings, take responsibility for what they want, and ask for help finding a solution. 
- Statements where we blame ourselves for the feelings of others, speak for someone else, or self-blame before knowing the facts are bids to take on too much responsibility, especially taking on responsibility for the feelings of others. 
- Stephen Karpman's Drama triangle (quoted):
    - *Victim* – In conflicts, victims take the position of “I’m not okay, you are okay,” and assume they are the problem. They compromise their own needs, feelings, and boundaries to keep the peace. They would rather lose the fight than assertively express their feelings.
    - _Persecutor_—In conflict, persecutors take the position of “I’m okay, you are not okay.” They assume they are right and others are wrong, and they go on the attack to prove their point. They justify their abusive behavior with the excuse that others deserve it.
    - _Rescuer_—In conflict, rescuers take the position of “I’m okay, and you would be okay if you let me fix you.” They swoop in with unsolicited advice as if others can’t think for themselves. They are solutions looking for a problem
- In the drama triangle, these roles become dependent on each other. Persecutors recruit victims so they can win. Victims recruit persecutors so they can lose and rescuers so they can feel helpless. Rescuers recruit victims to feel powerful. 
- The drama triangle results is wasting energy to play games instead of using it to solve problems.
- "Forgiveness is letting go of all hope for a better past."
- "Keeping our responsibility switch on in these types of situations involves three important steps: validating the other person’s experience without taking it on, inviting them to be part of the solution, and clarifying boundaries."
- "Boundaries are a foundation for strong relationships. Furthermore, when we don’t set and enforce boundaries, we can easily slip into forming negative opinions of others who seem to disrespect our wants and needs."
- "One of my partners, Rob Wert, is famous on our team for reminding us about “first principles.” When we get off on tangents or down a rabbit trail, Rob asks us to elevate our conversation back to what matters most. What fundamental principles and values are at stake? What are we ultimately trying to achieve? This helps us refocus from the particulars to the big picture. This reminder is especially helpful when we get too attached to one approach or perspective or distracted by details that aren’t helpful."
- "One way for leaders to escape this trap is to elevate their perspective from solutions to principles. Instead of focusing on solutions, focus on the values, principles, and goals that need to be met. Explain these to your team, then ask them to come up with solutions. Instead of focusing on finding solutions, you can evaluate if and how their solutions can serve those first principles."
- "The Barrett Values Centre has a saying: _“Values unite, beliefs divide.”_"

    - Change Starts with Me
- The Compassionate Accountability Assessment
- Setting Behavior Norms
- Embedding Compassionate Accountability: Where to Start
- Include These Three Questions in Every Survey
- Main Points

##### Notes
###### Main points
- When the switches are off, people will experience disconnection, division, and languishing. When the switches are on, people will experience connection, engagement, and a thriving culture.
- Each of the three switches is necessary but not sufficient on its own to ensure a culture of Compassionate Accountability.
- The main trends driving engagement for the new generation of employees can be addressed with the three switches.
- Change starts with you. You have control over only your own behaviors and choices.
- An honest evaluation of your culture using the Compassionate Accountability Assessment can help you determine whether you are in the danger zone, potential zone, opportunity zone, or strength zone.
- Setting behavior norms is a helpful way for leadership teams to embed Compassionate Accountability into their daily interactions.
- Start embedding compassionate accountability into your culture with these six areas of focus: talent acquisition; talent development; performance evaluation and support; discipline; mission vision and values; and key performance indicators.
- You can begin immediately by surveying your employees, customers, patients, or other stakeholders on where they experience switches in their daily interactions.

###### Other notes
- "When the value switch is off, teams and organizations engage in problem-solving and follow through, but people don’t feel safe. They worry about making mistakes and comply out of fear rather than connection and engagement."
- "When the capability switch is off, cultures often will have a family-like atmosphere, demonstrate loyalty to the organization’s mission and leadership, but lack innovation. They struggle to adapt and stay relevant."
- "When the responsibility switch is off, organizations suffer from a lack of consistency, integrity, and follow-through. They are more likely to fail during hard times because they don’t have a strong foundation."
- Employees want to know their work has purpose, a coach (not a boss), frequent feedback, focus on strengths, investment in growth and development.

##### Notes
###### Main points
- Compassionate Accountability is not another program but a mindset, skill set, and framework for struggling with others in any situation.
- Compassionate Accountability is not another training but a foundational set of principles and practices for thriving work cultures.
- Compassionate Accountability is not another prescription for difficult conversations but a template to engage differently for transformative results.
- Compassionate Accountability is not another theory but an actionable process for mindfulness, social and emotional intelligence, leadership agility, inclusion, presence, healthy conflict, and resiliency.

###### Other points
- Positive and compassionate conflict is healthy and a foundation for trust
- Drama diverts time and energy and leads to distress
- Large scale behavior change needs to be modeled by leaders first. 
- Get input and support from the broader organization. 
- Be proactive. It's hard-to-impossible to build new cultural habits after crisis hits.
- Match the intervention to the error:
    - Natural human errors: console and offer support
    - Errors that put someone at risk: discuss the situation
    - Reckless behavior: enforce appropriate consequences
- When dealing with errors, trust intentions (value), encourage learning from mistakes (capability), and ensure safety (responsibility)
- Focus on the foundational processes or outcomes which, if improved, would have the largest impact on success. 
- Implement metrics for what you want to improve. "What gets measured gets done."
- Conflict is a source of energy. When we misuse that energy, it becomes drama. When it use it well, we can use it to create. 
- Diversity can be a source of creative conflict if used well. 

### Part IV. Overcoming Barriers to Compassion

#### 9. Compassion Is Just for Bleeding Hearts
##### Contents
- Many Reasons and Many Ways to Act Compassionately
- Affective versus Cognitive Empathy
- Main Points

##### Notes
###### Main points
- _The barrier_—Defining compassion as empathy in action is limiting and creates barriers to entry for many leaders. They can’t embrace empathy as the on-ramp for developing compassion even though they support a more compassionate workplace.
- _The reality_—Empathy isn’t the only motivator for compassion. Different people have their own reasons for acting compassionately, and they do it in different ways. Furthermore, empathy has a cognitive component, so we can appreciate another’s experience and meet people where they are by using our heads, not just our hearts.
- _The hopeful message_—Anyone can find an on-ramp to expand their understanding and practice of compassion.
- _The lesson_—If we are trying to become more compassionate leaders, we must meet people where they are and invite them to make a positive difference by using their inborn motivators and strengths as a starting point.
- _The leadership accountability_—You are accountable for being a good steward of your personality, skills, and experience. As a leader, you are accountable for helping others become good stewards of their personality, skills, and experiences. Although you aren’t responsible for their behaviors, you are accountable to them for your behaviors, which means meeting them where they are, honoring who they are, and journeying together to a better future. That’s compassion: struggling with.

#### 10. Compassion Creates Dependence
##### Contents
- Alleviating Suffering Can Create Dependence
- Alleviating Suffering Can Lead to Burnout
- The Game-Changing Impact of Struggling with Others
- The Gift of Struggle
- Practicing Compassion Even When You Can’t Fix a Problem
- Main Points

##### Notes
###### Main points
- The barrier—Assuming the goal of compassion is to alleviate suffering can lead to relationships based on rescuing, which creates dependence and leads to burnout.
- The reality—Compassion actually means to “suffer with.” When we view compassion as an opportunity to get alongside people and walk together through the pain, we can find solutions that transform everyone involved in the relationship.
- The hopeful message—You no longer have to expect yourself to fix the problem to be compassionate. Anyone can practice compassion, even when alleviating the suffering isn’t possible or the best long-term option.
- The lesson—The starting point for compassion is to get open with each other about what we are going through, and embrace the gift of struggle. Even when we can’t fix the pain, we can be with each other through it. This, by itself, can open up perspectives we never saw before and transform relationships and systems.
- The leadership accountability—You are accountable for connecting with people at a human level, and that includes sharing your struggles. Only then can you expect others to do the same. Being vulnerable isn’t weak, and it isn’t a liability if you take responsibility to treat your own and others’ struggles with respect and kindness.

###### Other points
- It's not about alleviating suffering *for* others, it's about struggling together
- Suffering together: meet people where they are, understand leverage points for systematic solutions, eliminate dependence on external inputs (e.g., donations), clarify that everyone has important responsibilities (no free riders)

#### 11. Compassion Is Soft
##### Contents
- Compassion Is a Mindset, Not a Tactic
- Compassion Is a Choice, Not a Mandate
- Compassion Requires the Bravery to Be Vulnerable
- Compassion Requires the Confidence to Be Humble
- Compassion Requires the Courage to Walk the Talk
- If They Can, So Can You
- Main Points

##### Notes
###### Main points
- The barrier—When we view compassion as less relevant than other leadership skills or too soft to be taken seriously, we avoid doing the most important and difficult work of leadership.
- The reality—Compassion requires the bravery to be vulnerable, the confidence to be humble, and the courage to walk the talk. It’s not soft or easy.
- The hopeful message—When leaders invest in personal transformation and authentic connection, it pays off many times over.
- The lesson—Accept that compassion is a necessary and relevant leadership skill, and approach it like any other core competency.
- The leadership accountability—You are accountable for developing your emotional awareness and fluency because they are fundamental leadership competencies.

###### Other notable points
- Compassion requires bravery (to be vulnerable), confidence (to be humble), courage (to walk the talk).

#### 12. Compassion Is Selfless
##### Contents
- Compassion Includes You and Invites You to Be Your Best
- Compassion Is Intrinsically Rewarding
- Compassion Is Self-ful
- Main Points

##### Notes
###### Main points
- The barrier—If compassion means putting ourselves last, we won’t be able to sustain the difficult work, and we won’t experience the intrinsic satisfaction that comes with it.
- The reality—You are a valuable, capable, and responsible part of the compassion equation. You can and should take elegant care of yourself along the way.
- The hopeful message—When you become self-ful as a leader, you can experience the intrinsic, restorative benefits of compassion for yourself.
- The lesson—Take 100 percent responsibility for your feelings, thoughts, and actions. This means being self-ful so you can show up with the energy and enthusiasm to face the difficult challenges of being a leader.
- The leadership accountability—You are accountable for your feelings, thoughts, and actions. This means you can’t blame others for your experiences, and you can’t take over responsibility for others’ feelings, thoughts, and actions. You are accountable to stay on the right side of that fine line. When you do, others will be invited and inspired to do the same.


#### 13. Compassion Can’t Be Learned
##### Contents
- Compassion Can Be Learned
- How Does Change Happen?
- The Power of Mindset
- Main Points

##### Notes
- The barrier—If we believe that some people are just more compassionate by nature, this lowers self-confidence and holds us back from developing our compassion skills.
- The reality—Compassion, like any other leadership competency, can be learned.
- The hopeful message—Leaders no longer have to make excuses. They can be confident that their efforts will pay off.
- The lesson—Mindset matters. Instead of making excuses or losing confidence, make the choice to change your mindset. This will open up new possibilities for you to learn and grow.
- The leadership accountability—You are accountable for your mind-set. Every day in every interaction, you get to choose how you will view yourself and others and how you will show up as a leader.

**Book Review: Compassionate Accountability**

In a business world often characterized by the tension between compassion and accountability, this book presents a compelling case for why these two concepts are not opposites but, in fact, complementary forces that can drive success when combined effectively. The book offers a fresh perspective on leadership, emphasizing that true compassion must include accountability to foster genuine, productive, and healthy work environments.

### The Core Concept

The book introduces the idea of "Compassionate Accountability," a leadership model that integrates the necessity of compassion with the rigor of accountability. It argues that compassion isn't merely about alleviating suffering or being nice; rather, it involves a deeper commitment to struggling together, recognizing others as valuable, capable, and responsible. This holistic approach ensures that leaders do not have to choose between being compassionate or holding people accountable; they can—and should—do both.

### Key Strengths

One of the book's primary strengths is its emphasis on the mutual reinforcement between compassion and accountability. It posits that these elements are essential for enabling people to be effective and for building strong, resilient teams. The notion that conflict can be a source of creative energy, rather than just drama, is particularly insightful. By viewing conflict as an opportunity for innovation, leaders can harness this energy constructively.

### Practical Applications

The book is structured into several parts, each addressing different aspects of Compassionate Accountability. The first part lays the foundation by exploring the evolution of compassion in the business world and debunking the myth that compassion and accountability are at odds. The second part introduces "The Compassion Mindset" model, which revolves around three key switches: value, capability, and responsibility. These switches help leaders and organizations assess and enhance their approach to compassionate accountability.

The practical advice provided is thorough and actionable. For instance, turning on the "value switch" involves behaviors such as validating others' feelings without judgment and embracing vulnerability. The "capability switch" focuses on understanding, sharing resources, and learning from failures, while the "responsibility switch" emphasizes owning one's emotions, thoughts, and actions without overstepping into others' responsibilities.

### Critiques

While the book has strong core ideas, it does suffer from some padding and redundancy. At times, the content feels stretched, repeating similar concepts in different chapters without adding significant new insights. This can detract from the overall reading experience, making some sections feel less impactful.

Additionally, the book leans more towards teaching the value of compassion rather than providing detailed guidance on how to hold others accountable compassionately. For readers seeking specific strategies for implementing compassionate accountability, this focus might be slightly disappointing.

### Comparison with Radical Candor

Compared to "Radical Candor" by Kim Scott, this book offers unique contributions, particularly the value/capability/responsibility model and the concept of conflict as a source of creative energy. While "Radical Candor" remains a more comprehensive guide to candid and compassionate leadership, "Compassionate Accountability" enriches the conversation by highlighting the interconnectedness of compassion and accountability and offering a nuanced perspective on how leaders can balance these elements effectively.

### Conclusion

"Compassionate Accountability" is a thought-provoking read that challenges traditional leadership paradigms. It calls for a reimagined approach where compassion and accountability are not mutually exclusive but are integrated to foster healthier and more effective workplaces. Despite some repetitive sections, the book's core ideas and practical applications make it a valuable resource for leaders looking to cultivate a culture of compassionate accountability in their organizations.
