My kids are cranky. Someone at work is arguing with me over something that should have been clear months ago. Help me regain a moment of calm.

Let’s start by creating a small mental buffer between you and everything happening around you. Here’s a simple three-step approach to regain calm:

1. **Pause and Breathe:**  
   Take a deep breath in for four counts, hold it for four counts, then exhale slowly for six counts. Repeat this three times. It’s surprisingly effective at grounding you.

2. **Name What’s Happening:**  
   Label the emotions you’re feeling right now—maybe it’s frustration, overwhelm, or even guilt. Naming them can help you separate the feelings from yourself.  
   - For the kids: *"They're cranky because they’re probably tired or hungry—it’s not about me."*  
   - For the work issue: *"This disagreement is about clarity, not about me personally."*

3. **Reclaim a Moment for Yourself:**  
   Close your eyes and imagine a place where you feel safe and calm—a quiet beach, a cozy room, or a favorite park. Picture yourself there for 30 seconds. Focus on the details: the colors, the sounds, the sensations.

When you feel ready, decide on your next small step: for your kids, it might be a snack or distraction that helps reset the mood. For work, you could say, *"Let’s take a moment to refocus on our shared goal,"* and reframe the conversation later when you’re in a calmer state.

Finally, consider making space for some connection later: share a laugh with your kids or extend an olive branch at work. It can shift the energy around you. Let me know how it goes!
