How large is a chromosome? Give both a measurement and something to compare it to

Chromosomes vary in size, but on average, each chromosome is about 2 to 10 micrometers long. To give you a comparison, a human hair is about 75 micrometers in diameter, so a chromosome is much thinner than a strand of hair. It's also worth noting that chromosomes are only visible under a microscope during certain phases of cell division. In their most condensed form, during metaphase, they reach their maximum size and are then visible under a light microscope.

Why are they at their largest in their most condensed form? Doesn't condensed usually mean compact?

Yes, "condensed" typically means compacted or compressed, and this is also true for chromosomes. However, it's important to clarify what "large" means in this context.

When chromosomes condense, their long, thin strands of DNA tightly coil and fold. This condensation is crucial for cell division, as it makes the chromosomes short and thick, which are easier to segregate accurately into daughter cells. So, when we say chromosomes are at their "largest" during metaphase, we're referring to their most visible or distinct form, not their length.

In their uncondensed state (like during interphase), chromosomes are longer and thinner, more like extremely fine threads, and are dispersed throughout the nucleus, making them harder to distinguish under a microscope. During metaphase, this condensed state makes them shorter and thicker, akin to the way a coiled telephone cord is shorter but bulkier than an uncoiled one. This physical transformation makes them most visible and identifiable under a microscope.
