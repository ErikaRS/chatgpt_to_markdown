How can I help a leader to be successful when they are technically strong but tend to assume negative intent in their interactions with others? They have a reputation of not communicating effectively (e.g. always finding problems rather than looking for solutions, expecting people to adapt to their communication style instead of adapting to their needs — even with executive leadership and cross functional partners who cannot be expected to know how their team would). However, they also identify relevant problems and, when they do get in problem solving mode, find good solutions.

This person's manager wants to help them be successful in a highly collaborative workplace. However, they deeply mistrust their manager.

Helping a technically strong leader who tends to assume negative intent in interactions and has difficulty in effective communication requires a nuanced approach, focusing on building trust, enhancing self-awareness, and developing interpersonal skills. Here are strategies that can be considered to support this leader's growth and success:

### 1. **Build Trust**
- **Personal Connection**: The manager should strive to establish a personal connection, showing genuine interest in the leader's well-being, aspirations, and concerns. Regular one-on-one meetings in a non-threatening environment can facilitate this.
- **Confidentiality and Support**: Assure confidentiality and demonstrate unwavering support for the leader’s growth, emphasizing that the goal is not to criticize but to help them succeed in their role.

### 2. **Enhance Self-awareness**
- **Feedback and Self-reflection**: Encourage self-reflection by providing specific, constructive feedback on how their behavior affects others. Use examples to highlight the impact of assuming negative intent.
- **Personality Assessment Tools**: Utilize personality assessments or 360-degree feedback tools to help the leader gain insights into their communication style and how it is perceived by others.
- **Mentoring**: Pair them with a mentor who has strong emotional intelligence and effective communication skills. This mentor can serve as a role model and provide guidance on navigating complex interpersonal situations.

### 3. **Develop Interpersonal Skills**
- **Training and Coaching**: Invest in leadership coaching or workshops focused on emotional intelligence, effective communication, and conflict resolution.
- **Practice Active Listening**: Encourage the leader to practice active listening, showing empathy and understanding of other perspectives before responding. Role-playing exercises can be beneficial in developing this skill.
- **Solution-focused Approach**: Train them to adopt a solution-focused mindset, emphasizing the importance of identifying solutions alongside problems. Encourage them to praise others’ efforts and contributions to foster a positive work environment.

### 4. **Create Opportunities for Positive Interaction**
- **Collaborative Projects**: Involve them in cross-functional projects that require collaboration, ensuring they work with team members who have strong interpersonal skills. This can provide them with a model of effective communication and teamwork.
- **Recognition and Appreciation**: Publicly acknowledge their technical contributions and problem-solving abilities. Positive reinforcement can boost
