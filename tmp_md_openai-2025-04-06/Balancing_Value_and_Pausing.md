We’re not done until the customers get value: When there is a gap between what we say we’ve built and the customer experience in practice, that undermines trust. Let’s invest in fixing this gap, working with cross functional partners and utilizing customer feedback to define “done”. 

Iterate to success: Our product changes rapidly, so we should focus on adding value every quarter, rather than working on projects that will add value only after many quarters. However, that doesn’t mean building low quality software. We should expect to build on what we have done, so we should build it well. 

Q: How do we make sure that "we are able to pause after a quarter" and "We're not done until the customer gets value" are not contradicting?

Start of my answer: Good question! And I think it is going to vary by type of project.

Good question! Indeed, it is going to vary by the type of project, but let's delve deeper into how we can reconcile these two seemingly conflicting approaches – "pausing after a quarter" and "we're not done until the customer gets value".

Firstly, it's crucial to define what "pausing after a quarter" means in the context of your organization. This pause is not necessarily a full stop but rather a checkpoint. It's a time to evaluate progress, gather feedback, and make informed decisions about the next steps. The goal is to ensure that every quarter adds tangible value to the product, aligning with the principle of iterative development. 

To ensure these pauses are effective and do not contradict the goal of delivering value to the customer, consider the following strategies:

1. **Set Clear Milestones:** Define clear, achievable goals for each quarter that contribute to the overall product vision. These milestones should be designed to deliver incremental value to the customer, ensuring that even if work pauses, what has been delivered is useful and functional.

2. **Integrate Customer Feedback:** Regularly incorporate customer feedback into your development process. This ensures that what is being built aligns with customer needs and expectations. Pausing to reassess doesn’t mean work is incomplete; it means you’re verifying alignment with customer value.

3. **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Work closely with cross-functional teams to understand and align on what 'done' means for each phase. This ensures that even if a project is paused, all teams have a common understanding of the current state and value of the product.

4. **Quality Assurance:** Emphasize building well and avoiding technical debt. This approach ensures that even if a project is paused after a quarter, the work done is of high quality and can be built upon in the future.

5. **Agile Methodology:** Utilize agile methodologies to remain flexible and responsive. Agile frameworks are designed to accommodate changes and pivots, making it easier to align short-term efforts with long-term customer value.

6. **Effective Communication:** Keep open channels of communication with all stakeholders, including customers, throughout the development process. This helps in managing expectations and ensures that everyone understands the rationale behind pauses and shifts in direction.

7. **Review and Reflect:** Use the end of each quarter not only to pause and plan but also to review what has been achieved and how it aligns with customer value. Reflect on lessons learned and use these insights to inform future development cycles.

By integrating these strategies, your organization can effectively balance the need for periodic reassessment and the commitment to delivering customer value. This approach allows for flexibility and adaptability in your product development process, ensuring that you consistently meet customer needs while also staying agile and responsive to change.

Make it shorter (3-5 sentences) and chattier. Only capture the things that really point to the tension between these principles and leave out the things that are generally known good software development practices (like effective communicatioa, agile methodology, and QA)

Absolutely, balancing these two principles can be tricky! Think of the quarterly pause as a quick pit stop, not the end of the race. It's a chance to check if we're on track with delivering real value to our customers. To nail this, set clear, short-term goals that add up to something meaningful for the customer. And crucially, weave in customer feedback regularly – it's like having a co-pilot guiding you to make sure you're heading in the right direction!
