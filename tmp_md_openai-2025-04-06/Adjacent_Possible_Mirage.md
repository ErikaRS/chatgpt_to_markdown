This week‚Äôs lens: Trilemma.

You and your project colleague are puzzling over a problem: the product you build is laser-focused on its users and what‚Äôs good for business, but there‚Äôs still insufficient lift to hit your goals. It‚Äôs almost like there is some other unseen force tugging at you. After a lot of whiteboarding, exhausted, it dawns on you: you forgot about the surrounding ecosystem. There aren‚Äôt two parts in this puzzle, but rather three. And you can only have your product focus on two of them at a time.

Welcome to the world of trilemmas. Trilemmas are like dilemmas, but instead of two unfavorable or mutually exclusive choices, there are three. Trilemmas typically represent impossible spaces: we want to satisfy all three conditions somehow but can only afford their subset.

Trilemmas are all around us. The infamous project management triangle is a trilemma: among scope, cost, and time, you can only pick two. There‚Äôs also Zooko‚Äôs triangle, which posits that a network protocol can only satisfy two of the desired constraints (memorable, secure, or decentralized).

Unlike some lenses, trilemmas don‚Äôt offer solutions or paths forward. Instead, they clarify the situation in a way that allows the participants in this situation to recognize and respect the impossibility of its full resolution.

Recognizing that the scope of a project can‚Äôt keep growing without impacting cost or time is a very valuable insight ‚Äî and something that a skilled project manager will know by heart.

A good way to uncover a trilemma is to listen to an argument or discussion going in circles and try to discern a missing variable. If all assumptions in the conversation are implicitly based on different assumptions about the values of this variable, you might have a trilemma on your hands.

Given this, draft up a lens for "the adjacent possible mirage"

This week‚Äôs lens: The Adjacent Possible Mirage.

Imagine you and your team are working on a new innovation, eagerly pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Your brainstorming sessions are filled with excitement as you explore countless ideas, each seemingly within reach. However, as you attempt to implement these ideas, you find yourself hitting unforeseen obstacles. What seemed so attainable now feels elusive, like a mirage on the horizon.

Welcome to the concept of the Adjacent Possible Mirage. The "adjacent possible" refers to the idea that at any given moment, there are certain innovations or changes that are possible based on the current state of knowledge, technology, and resources. It's the next step in evolution, the immediate frontier. However, the mirage aspect highlights the deceptive nature of this frontier. Ideas that appear within grasp can often be misleadingly complex or unattainable due to hidden constraints.

The Adjacent Possible Mirage teaches us that while the allure of immediate potential is captivating, it requires a discerning eye to separate true possibilities from illusions. This lens encourages us to critically evaluate our goals, ensuring we have the resources, knowledge, and capabilities to bring our visions to fruition. Recognizing the mirage helps in setting realistic expectations, planning more effectively, and ultimately avoiding the frustration of chasing unattainable goals.

In practice, the Adjacent Possible Mirage urges teams to prototype and test early and often. By validating assumptions and identifying constraints early in the process, we can better navigate the complex landscape of innovation, ensuring that our efforts are directed towards feasible and impactful advancements.

Change the opening example to a different domain. Maybe social change, but keep it neutral and not political

Imagine you and your community group are working towards a social change initiative, inspired by a vision of a better future. Your discussions are filled with enthusiasm as you explore various strategies, each seeming like a clear path to progress. However, as you begin to implement these strategies, unexpected barriers arise. What once felt within reach now seems like an illusion, retreating further away with each step you take.

Clarify and streamline the language in this draft while keeping the overall flow and content:
When it comes to the world of social change, a better tomorrow always seems to be just around the corner. This belief can lead to enthusiasm and a willingness to tackle the unknown. However, as we start to implement our vision, unexpected barriers arise. What once felt within reach now seems like a dream, leading to disillusionment and cynicism. Welcome to the adjacent possible mirage. 

The adjacent possible refers to the idea that there is a limited set of moves we can make from where we currently stand. Every new invention is the adjacent possible of some previous invention. 

The adjacent possible mirage arises when our beliefs about our adjacent possible deviate from reality. What differentiates the mirage from outright self deception is that the adjacent possible mirage legitimately appears within our grasp. It contains hidden complexity and invisible constraints that we cannot see until we start the real work of realizing our vision. 

Because any candidate adjacent possible may be a mirage, we need to critically evaluate our end goals. Do we really understand the problem? Do we have the resources, knowledge, and capability to realize our goals? 

Recognizing the mirage shouldn‚Äôt deter us from pushing for change, but it can help us plan more effectively and avoid the frustration of getting stuck in the messy middle between dream and realization.

This week‚Äôs lens: The Adjacent Possible Mirage.

In the realm of social change, a better tomorrow often feels just within reach. This belief fuels enthusiasm and a willingness to tackle the unknown. However, as we start implementing our vision, unexpected barriers arise. What once seemed attainable now appears elusive, leading to disillusionment and cynicism. Welcome to the adjacent possible mirage.

The adjacent possible refers to the idea that there is a limited set of moves we can make from our current position. Every new invention is the adjacent possible of some previous invention.

The adjacent possible mirage occurs when our beliefs about what is possible deviate from reality. Unlike outright self-deception, the mirage appears legitimately within reach but contains hidden complexities and constraints that only become visible during the implementation process.

To navigate this, we need to critically evaluate our goals. Do we truly understand the problem? Do we have the resources, knowledge, and capability to achieve our goals?

Recognizing the mirage shouldn't deter us from pushing for change. Instead, it helps us plan more effectively and avoid the frustration of getting stuck between dream and realization.
