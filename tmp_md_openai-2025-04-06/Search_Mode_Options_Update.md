A product has different modes of interpreting search queries. We are changing the behavior and trying to figure out the write phrasing for the user visible copy. 

Current version:
Smart Search
[] Enable: Suggest variations of your query to find more results that may relate.
[] Disable: Only sow results that precisely match your query.

New version:
Search Mode Picker
[] Smart: Suggest variations of your query to find more results that may relate.
[] Precise (NEW) ðŸ’–: Spaces are interpreted as AND.
[] Precise (legacy): Spaces are interpreted literally.


The feedback we got is that "Precise" is problematic because we have a different feature that's called "Precise" (for code navigation). Suggest other variants of the new copy which capture the new functionality but don't use the word precise

Certainly, finding the right terminology for user interface elements is crucial for clear communication and user experience. Given the feedback and the need to avoid the term "Precise," here are some alternative suggestions for your new search mode options:

1. **Enhanced Search Mode Picker**
   - [] **Smart Search**: Suggests variations of your query to find more results that may relate.
   - [] **Exact Match (NEW) ðŸ’–**: Spaces are interpreted as AND.
   - [] **Literal Match**: Spaces are interpreted literally.

2. **Query Interpretation Mode**
   - [] **Intelligent**: Expands your query to include related results.
   - [] **Strict Match (NEW) ðŸ’–**: Treats spaces as logical AND.
   - [] **Direct Match**: Considers spaces as part of the exact search term.

3. **Search Flexibility Selector**
   - [] **Dynamic**: Adapts your query for broader results.
   - [] **Focused (NEW) ðŸ’–**: Spaces signify conjunction (AND).
   - [] **Verbatim**: Treats spaces as literal characters in your search.

4. **Search Precision Adjuster**
   - [] **Adaptive Search**: Modifies your query to discover related content.
   - [] **Conjunction (NEW) ðŸ’–**: Interprets spaces as connectors (AND).
   - [] **Direct Query**: Maintains the exact structure of your search terms.

5. **Query Mode Options**
   - [] **Flexible**: Explores variations of your query for more results.
   - [] **Comprehensive (NEW) ðŸ’–**: Spaces indicate combined search terms.
   - [] **Exact Phrase**: Searches for the precise sequence of words.

These options aim to clearly differentiate between the various search modes while avoiding confusion with existing features. They also seek to provide users with a straightforward understanding of each mode's functionality.

I like the idea of using "Flexible" but as a synonym for "Precise (NEW)" not Smart. What are the tradeoffs of 
- Smart
- Flexible
- Literal

(Note that Smart can't be changed because it's already a user facing concept)

### Assistant - 2023-12-08 09:15:56

Using "Smart," "Flexible," and "Literal" as terminology for different search modes offers a clear distinction in functionality while being intuitive for users. Here's an analysis of the tradeoffs for each term:

1. **Smart**
   - **Pros**: 
     - The term "Smart" implies intelligence and adaptability, suggesting that this mode can intelligently interpret and expand queries to provide comprehensive results.
     - It's already a familiar concept to your users, which helps in maintaining consistency and avoiding confusion.
   - **Cons**: 
     - It might be perceived as too broad or vague, leaving users uncertain about the specific nature of the search alterations.
     - Users might assume that "Smart" is always the best option, potentially overlooking the benefits of the other modes.

2. **Flexible**
   - **Pros**: 
     - "Flexible" suggests a balance between exactness and adaptability. It indicates that this mode interprets spaces as logical connectors (AND), offering more precise results than "Smart" but with some level of interpretation.
     - It conveys a sense of user control and customization, as "flexible" implies adjustability to user needs.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Users might not immediately understand the specific technical interpretation of spaces as AND connectors, requiring some learning or additional explanation.
     - There's a risk that it might be confused with "Smart," as both suggest adaptability, albeit in different ways.

3. **Literal**
   - **Pros**: 
     - The term "Literal" is very clear and self-explanatory in the context of search queries. It accurately describes the functionality where the search engine interprets spaces and terms exactly as entered.
     - It provides a straightforward option for users who are looking for precise, unaltered results based on their specific input.
   - **Cons**: 
     - This mode might be less appealing to users who are not searching for exact phrases or who are unsure of the exact terms to use, potentially limiting its perceived usefulness.
     - It could be viewed as less sophisticated compared to "Smart" or "Flexible," especially if users are looking for more dynamic and intelligent search capabilities.

In conclusion, while "Smart" remains as a familiar and intelligent search option, the introduction of "Flexible" provides a middle ground between the broad, adaptive search of "Smart" and the strict, exact search of "Literal." This trio of terms covers a comprehensive range of search preferences, catering to different user needs and expectations. However, it's important to clearly communicate the distinct functionality of each mode to ensure users can make informed choices that best suit their search requirements.
