What is a good animal emoji for a rower

A good animal emoji for a rower could be the üê¨ Dolphin, as dolphins are known for their speed, agility, and ability to glide through the water, much like a rower. It conveys a sense of fluid motion and teamwork, which are key in rowing. 

Another option could be the ü¶Ü Duck, which also fits well with rowing due to its natural presence on water and smooth movement. 

Which of these speaks more to your needs, or is there a specific vibe you're going for?
