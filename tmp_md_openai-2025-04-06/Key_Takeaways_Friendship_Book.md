## Highlights
- It turns out that friendship does have survival value in the most literal sense-more socially integrated people live longer than those who are less well connected. (Page 6)
- For both humans and animals, to be social is to behave in a way that affects another being. That behavior can be positive or negative. It can be subtle and small-a glance or a touch or a whisper. It can be big and booming and brawny, like a physical attack or a loud declaration. It can be anything in between. If primates, which, of course, includes us, are specialized for anything, it's social behavior. (Page 8)
- Biologists speak of these two explanations-how and why-as proximate and ultimate causes for behavior. They're complementary, not competing. One is near, and one is far. One is visible, the other invisible, and must be guessed at since evolutionary theory must be studied indirectly. Evolution works over thousands of years and cannot be proved by a direct experiment in the way that theories in physics can be proved. (Page 16)
- A friendship is an organism that shifts its shape across our life spans according to our abilities and our availability in other words, according to how much we open ourselves to its possibilities. While there is natural variation in our taste and need for companionship, there are some universals in what draws us together or throws us apart. And there is a bottom line-a biological need for connection that must be met to achieve basic health and well-being. That is why social connection is rapidly becoming an issue of public health. (Page 16)
- Friendship is subtler. It encompasses subjects that feel intangible, such as emotion, conversation, and the inner workings of the mind. It has obvious cultural overtones that can obscure the fundamentals. (Page 22)
- But his most provocative idea was that "a friend is another self." Neuroscience and genetics will show thousands of years later that there was more to this idea than Aristotle could possibly have known. (Page 24)
- What causes behavior (meaning what is the underlying physiology)? How does it develop over an animal's lifetime? What is its adaptive value? And how has such a behavior evolved?20 (Page 28)
- After much thought and experiment, he arrived at a definition that considered a relationshipincluding those between friends-the result of repeated interactions between two individuals, each interaction building upon the last. His definition captures the way a satisfying conversation makes you want to talk to someone again, and how the next interaction is richer for what came before. (Page 29)
- What's less well recognized, but significant for the history of friendship, is that although Bowlby's work centered on mothers and children, he ultimately conceived of attachment as a lifelong phenomenon. In the first book in his seminal trilogy, Attachment, he wrote that in adolescence and adult life, attachment behavior "is a straightforward continuation" of the same behavior in childhood and was commonly directed outside the family, even toward groups and institutions. "In sickness and calamity, adults often become demanding of others; in conditions of sudden danger or disaster a person will almost certainly seek proximity to another known and trusted person." He was offended by the Freudian view that such behavior was unnatural. "To dub attachment behavior in adult life regressive is indeed to overlook the vital role that it plays in the life of man from the cradle to the grave."28 (Page 31)
- "Where the experimental biologist predicts the outcome of experiments, the evolutionary biologist retrodicts the experiment already performed by Nature; he teases science out of history," Wilson wrote. In his view, those who know natural history already have an abundance of answers in the facts and data they can see in front of them. "What they most need are the right questions." (Page 33)
    - Note: Quoting EO Wilson
- He decided that behavior could only be considered social if it affected someone else. He used levels of communication to determine where the lines between groups fell and to arrive at his definition of a "society," so that those that were regularly in touch, so to speak, were a society separate from those that rarely communicated. (Page 37)
- The bottom line of reciprocal altruism was that the cost to the giver had to be less than the benefit to the recipient. The sticking point, as Trivers saw it, was the problem of cheating. What's to stop the recipient from taking advantage? He argued that many emotions had evolved specifically to address this issue. His model predicted friendship and the emotion of liking and disliking. It predicted what he called moralistic aggression-our strong reaction to perceived injustice or unfairness. It predicted gratitude and sympathy, which he theorized evolved to reward reciprocal altruism. And that wasn't all. It predicted guilt, trust, and reputation (learning from others about who can be trusted to reciprocate and who can't). These traits can be learned, Trivers argued. They are subject to change depending on circumstances early in life. And they can be used to cement friendship. He concluded by acknowledging the complexity of the system he was proposing. It was a veritable kitchen sink of emotion and motivation. Perhaps, he suggested, that very complexity might explain the increase in brain size seen in hominids since the Pleistocene Era. It took a lot of brain power to keep track of all this emotion after all. (Page 37)
- This framework took the idea of "fitness"--essentially, the combination of traits that make up an indi vidual's chances of reproductive success and survival-and split it into two categories. Direct fitness concerned an organism's own survival and reproductive success. Indirect fitness concerned the success of others with the same genes. The two together were dubbed "inclusive fitness." (Page 40)
- In 1966 evolutionary biologist George Williams put the new idea this way: "Simply stated, an individual who maximizes his friendships and minimizes his antagonisms will have an evolutionary advantage, and selection should favor those characters that promote the optimization of personal relationships." (Page 40)
- Our social lives begin at birth. "Humans are born predisposed to care how they relate to others," anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy wrote.' But parts of that natural predisposition are raw and fragile, and they must be nurtured. To make a friend and then to be a friend is a complex undertaking. Young children have to grow into the job because connecting positively and consistently with their peers places considerable demands on emerging cognitive and emotional abilities. Yet succeed they must. In the first few years of life, establishing relationships with other children is a major milestone. Parents must help. (Page 43)
- Among mammals, and even among primates, however, humans extend childhood far longer than any other species. This is the result of a trade-off. "Our rate of brain development is grossly slowed down, which has the positive consequence that we're able to let post-natal experience shape our brains much more. Of course, it also means we're born more helpless than other primates," says psychologist Mark Johnson, an expert in developmental cognition at both the University of Cambridge and Birkbeck, University of London.3 (Page 44)
- Seen this way, empathy has three main components.30 Emotional empathy, sharing another's feelings and matching his or her behavioral states, is a biological response found in many different species that probably evolved in the context of parental care and group living, both of which mean being exposed to and responding to the emotional signals of others. Cognitive empathy, which is where perspective taking or theory of mind fall, is the capacity to think about and understand another's feelings. And empathic concern, or compassion, adds the motivation to do something about another's suffering. Taken together, these components are fundamental elements of our social lives. "People empathize because it's absolutely critical for forming close relationships or relating to people at all," says psychologist Jamil Zaki of Stanford University, whose lab is devoted to studying empathy.31 (Page 61)
- Empathy of any sort begins with something very fundamental: the ability to know where you end and another individual begins. It requires a sense of self. (Page 61)
- Emotional support makes us feel cared for. We employ it when we confide in someone or serve as a confidant, when we describe hopes and dreams, express anxiety, talk over problems, provide encouragement and feedback. Instrumental support is more tangible. It refers to pragmatic assistance, such as watching someone's child, sending over lasagna, carrying moving boxes, or lending money. And finally, there is informational support-instructions for treating the stomach flu or tips about sunny apartments for rent or promising job openings. (Page 70)
- Cacioppo's colleague Louise Hawkley, who worked with him for twenty years, agrees. "Loneliness," she says, "was a convenient, helpful way of assessing a fundamental need of human existence, that we are bred to connectedness, we are bred in connectedness, that we cannot avoid it and that to the extent we have those needs thwarted we are going to pay the price."27 (Page 78)
- For psychologists like Cacioppo, the most important distinction was one of perception. Loneliness is how you feel about your social life. If you are truly introverted and prefer to be alone, you are not necessarily lonely. But if you yearn for connections you do not have, that is loneliness. It is the opposite of feeling a sense of belonging or embeddedness, the opposite of feeling one's intimate needs are met. According to Cacioppo, "the deeply disruptive hurt" of loneliness equals perceived isolation. 31 (Page 78)
- It asks twenty probing questions. How often do you feel that you are "in tune" with the people around you? How often do you feel that you lack companionship? How often do you feel shy? How often do you feel that there are people you can turn to? (Page 79)
- And they were ultimately able to show that changing loneliness-making someone less lonely-could, in fact, change depression. It was hard evidence that loneliness had costs worth addressing. (Page 80)
- He developed a provocative theory: that loneliness begins as an adaptive response. Just as hunger signals us that we need to eat, perhaps loneliness was a warning bell designed to make us want to be with others, the social equivalent of physical pain, hunger, and thirst. (Page 81)
- When you most need social connection, it would seem, you are the least able to achieve it (Page 82)
- Entirely positive ties-those that make us feel unconditionally supported-make up about half of our social networks and they have proven pretty easy to interpret. Studies show that these happy relationships provide a sense of purpose and meaning, they improve our outlook, and they encourage us to engage in better health behaviors. "All of those things we know are associated with better biological aging," Uchino, who is now at the University of Utah, says. (Page 84)
- He now thinks the evidence is unequivocal: ambivalent relationships are bad for us. "We have never found a case where ambivalent ties look beneficial for people in terms of their biology," he says. (Page 86)
- Steve Cole from the University of California, Los Angeles.45 Cole was interested in social effects on gene expression. Although codes for traits and behavior are written in our genes, they can be turned on or off by circumstance so that the mere presence of a gene is not always definitive. Genes sometimes stay silent, like an opinion that is never voiced. "For a gene to have an influence on what a cell does or how a human works, it needs to be expressed," Cole says. He believed that the social environment might have the power to determine which genes speak up and which do not. "On a molecular level, our bodies are artifacts, things that culture makes," he once told an audience in Los Angeles. "They are far more fluid and permeable to environmental influence than we appreciate."46 (Page 88)
- The complexity of human brain development takes time. Much of that time is spent honing a new, more advanced set of social skills. (Page 92)
- Parents are the primary agents of socialization early on but then that role bumps up against some limits. Relationships with parents are too vertical and unequal to allow for all that children need to learn to do socially. Siblings help but come with their own rivalries. When kids arrive in school, they encounter horizontal relationships.2 They must begin to learn about cooperation and collaboration, reciprocity, and loyalty and what it means to be trustworthy. Friendship is where they do that. (Page 93)
- Asked to define a friend, they reel off three observations: "A friend plays with you"; "A friend shares with you"; "A friend doesn't hit you." Out of the mouths of babes, I tell you. Playing, sharing, and not hitting reflect young children's still very concrete thinking. These are recognizable, observable actions. All count as prosocial behavior, in that they are voluntary and intended to benefit others.
  With time, children's expectations of friends become less physical and more relational and abstract, but the foundational bones are still there if you dig for them. In adolescence, play turns into hanging around. Sharing turns into helping. Loyalty and intimacy become more central requirements, especially for best friends. Friends become important sources of validation and support, and children learn to provide support as well, something they are not generally in a position to do for their parents (Page 93)
- Fagen found that the bears that played the most, survived longest. "I believe that play teaches young animals to make sound judgments," Fagen told Brown. "For instance, play fighting may let a bear learn when it can trust another bear and, if things get too violent, when it needs to defend itself or flee. Play allows 'pretend' rehearsal for the challenges and ambiguities of life, a rehearsal in which life and death are not at stake."10 (Page 95)
- While there's some variation still in definitions of play, most converge on a few essential points. Playful behavior resembles a serious adult behavior but is done by a young animal or is exaggerated or awkward or otherwise altered. It serves no immediate survival purpose and appears to be voluntary and pleasurable. Play also happens only when animals are not under stress and have nothing else to do. In other words, it's fun.11 (Page 95)
- Why is this ostensibly unnecessary activity so pervasive? Because play is not unnecessary at all. It is vital. The fact that we see it in so many other species-like so many of the social behaviors this book discusses―tells us that it serves a larger purpose. As does the fact that it's fun. The brain is designed to make us like things that are good for us. (Page 96)
- It is actually hard to deprive animals other than humans of play. If you manage that trick, however, the animals become aggressive. In people, a lack of play or abnormal play in childhood is often a sign of a neurological disease or disorder like psychopathy. (Page 96)
- Their hypothesis was that not having friends in sixth grade triggered a greater sense of threat in seventh grade, which led to increased internalizing difficulties, such as depression and anxiety by eighth grade. That is just what they found. It wasn't friendlessness alone that created problems, it was the resulting sense of threat.18 (Page 101)
- Most of the time, bullying is a very strategic effort to gain and maintain status, she says. If anything has surprised her it is how consistently popular bullies are, at least in the short term. "Why should they change their behavior?" she now says. The rewards are so great." (Page 101)
- The more multifaceted a teenager's own identity-I play volleyball but I'm also a singer and a scholar-the more likely that child is to have friends in more than one crowd. (Page 103)
- But if that were so, wouldn't younger children, with their even less developed cortices, do even more stupid things than adolescents? Why the jump in risk taking at adolescence that isn't seen before or after?
  Because, it turns out, there is something of an imbalance in the developmental force. Adolescence is not just about the slow maturing of the frontal cortex and all the rest of the brain. Instead, it is a period when the brain's limbic system, a critical area for emotion, races ahead and the areas controlling judgment and reason lag behind. What really matters is this gap between thought and emotion. (Page 106)
- The goal of Casey's work is not to pathologize teenage behavior or complain about how frustrating or frightening kids this age can be. Instead, she wants to understand why they are that way. "I think of it more as an adaptive phase," Casey has said. 28 Experimentation is a natural phase of development, she says, one that is preparing teenagers for the rest of their lives where they will need to be independent of their parents. (Page 106)
- The scientists developed a more nuanced theory than one about pressure. "We came to the notion that basically when kids are around other kids it primes their reward system to be more easily aroused and more easily activated. That in turn leads them to pay undue attention to the potential rewards of a risky choice and relatively less to the potential costs."31 (Page 109)
- When teenagers are with each other, everything that feels good feels even better," Steinberg says. If what feels good is something that also carries some dangers to it, then kids get into trouble because they may pursue that activity ignorant of the dangers-or choosing to ignore them. But Steinberg and his colleagues have also shown that teenagers learn faster when they're with their peers than they do by themselves. And they engage in more exploratory behavior when they're with their peers. Steinberg says, "these could be good things, or they could be bad things depending upon what teenagers are exploring and what they're learning.
  Who the peers are becomes very important. "Parents shouldn't worry about peer pressure or peer influence," Steinberg says. "They should worry about who the peers are that their kids are hanging around with." When kids hang around with students who get better grades, their own grades go up over time. (Page 110)
- Steinberg writes, "It's the perfect neurobiological storm, at least if you'd like to make someone painfully self-conscious: Improvements in brain functioning in areas important for figuring out what other people are thinking, the heightened arousal of regions that are sensitive to social acceptance and social rejection, and the greater responsiveness to other people's emotional cues, like facial expressions."33 In other words, it actually hurts more to be rejected in adolescence than at any other age-not that it's fun no matter how old you are. The bottom line is that teenagers respond to the presence of their peers differently than adults do. (Page 111)
- Overall, the researchers found evidence that regular time spent with friends led to better routine health. 35 The benefits of social buffering, apparently, aren't limited to moments of acute stress. (Page 112)
- "Up until puberty, your parents are actually physiologically scaffolding you," Gunnar says. Then that changes. "Parents are supporting you [in adolescence] but they're not in your hypothalamus anymore. They've moved out of your body." (Page 114)
- In 1976, Cambridge psychologist Nicholas Humphrey wrote a prescient though purely speculative essay posing a new possibility. He argued that creatures are only as intelligent as their environments demand. (Page 118)
- The life of social animals is like a chess game, Humphrey argued, that required players to be "able to calculate the consequences of their own behavior, to calculate the likely behavior of others, to calculate the balance of advantage and loss-and all this in a context where the evidence on which their calculations are based is ephemeral, ambiguous, and liable to change, not least as a consequence of their own actions." Social skill Humphrey concluded, goes hand in hand with intellect and this need for intellect builds on itself like "an evolutionary ratchet, acting like self-winding watch to increase the general intellectual standing of the species." His conclusion: "I propose that the chief role of creative intellect is to hold society together." (Page 118)
- Living in groups helps animals solve two substantial ecological problems. One is the risk of being attacked by predators. There has always been strength in numbers. A lone individual-whether baboon or human-is a much easier target for a lion than a herd of individuals. The other major problem to solve is finding food. Animals must "make a living" off the land, gathering enough nutritional resources to sustain themselves. There has been a long-running debate within primatology and evolutionary biology as to which problem-predation or foraging-might be primary, and therefore, an animal's first order of business. According to the social brain hypothesis, both problems are solved by first creating a cohesive group whose members can coordinate their actions. The assumption has been that the average size of a group provides a proxy for how hard an animal has to work on its social life, and animals that live in larger groups have been found, on average, to have larger brains. (Page 120)
- Sociality is no longer invisible. Whether it is the driving force or a secondary development, it has a starring role in evolutionary theory. "Frankly it's a mistake to search for one and only one cause of brain growth in primates when it seems so clear that there are multiple plausible explanations," says primatologist Robert Seyfarth. (Page 121)
- They started speculating and, in the wee hours, came up with a new, far more life-affirming idea. An awful lot-if not most-of what people do could be summed up in one phrase: the need to belong, "Human beings," they would go on to write, "have a pervasive drive to form and maintain at least a minimum quantity of lasting, positive, and significant relationships." (Page 122)
- Fight-or-flight was not the only stress response that humans had developed, Taylor argued. There was also "tend and befriend." This was the instinct to nurture and care for others-born of the necessity of raising young-and Taylor argued that it was as hardwired as fight-or-flight, especially in females. Of the centuries of (mostly) male scientists who had written about evolution, Taylor wrote, "In their myopic focus on the aggressive experience of men, they ignore a very rich aspect of both women's and men's lives, namely the caring, nurturant side of human nature.... The tending instinct is every bit as tenacious as our more aggressive, selfish side. . . . Tending to others is as natural, as biologically based, as searching for food or sleeping, and its origins lie deep in our social nature." 13 (Page 125)
- The consensus, Silk wrote, was that human friendships were "intimate, supportive, egalitarian relationships." They required compatibility and an investment of time. Primatologists used the word "friendship" to describe a close and affiliative social relationship, in animals, that required time, support, tolerance, loyalty, security, and equality. What was missing-or not ascertainable, anyway-was the emotional bond, the good feeling that friendship generates in humans. Human and nonhuman relationships are not exactly the same, Silk allowed, but it seemed possible that their similarities could reveal something essential about the attributes of friendship. They would also hint at evolutionary history. (Page 132)
- Logically, if natural selection has favored the ability to form friendships, then three things must be true: friendships must increase reproductive success, individuals must seek out friends (or try to), and they must have the kind of social intelligence necessary to select the best partners. The results from Silk, Alberts, and Altmann appeared in Science in 2003. In the same issue, a paper from Seyfarth and Cheney's team showed that baboons recognize relations within and between matrilineal family members. Taken together, those papers, plus a later report mentioning Sylvia, provided persuasive evidence on all three evolutionary counts.28 (Page 134)
- There's growing evidence that what natural selection is favoring is the formation of strong social bonds," Seyfarth says. He and his col leagues have arrived at a relatively simple view of what kind of bond is required. It must be strong, stable, and relatively equitable. "That's what friendship is: a long-term, positive relationship that involves cooperation." That may not be as poetic as Aristotle's discourses on the perfection of philia. But this straightforward approach has allowed scientists to set up a base camp from which to launch further explorations into the still uncharted territory of relationships. (Page 136)
- At its best, friendship makes you feel valued and supported. It stretches out a net when you need to be caught. (Page 139)
- A pleasant interaction with a stranger at the supermarket doesn't make that person a friend. For most of us, friendships are voluntary, personal, positive, and persistent, and they usually assume some measure of equality. (Page 140)
- There is chemistry in friendship as there is in romantic relationships. We find it rewarding to learn that others like us and agree with us, and we tend to respond by liking those people back. But a calculus-sometimes unconscious-is at work as well. A friendship's rewards should outweigh its costs; the satisfaction and commitment we derive should be greater than the investment we make and the alternatives we forgo. A concern about fairness hovers in the background. The best relationships make us feel good and provide us with reliable sources of assistance and succor. Friendships that don't do this tend to fall away. (Page 140)
- While conducting oral histories with sixty-three senior citizens in the 1980s, sociologist Sarah Matthews of Cleveland State University recognized three distinct styles of friendship: independent, discerning, and acquisitive. Independent people consider themselves self-sufficient and content to socialize casually. Their friendships are often circumstantial, formed with schoolmates, coworkers, or neighbors, but not maintained. "I'm my own man. Do I have friends now? I have people that I know," said one such man. Discerning people are deeply tied to a few very close friends. Those relationships tended to be long lasting and harder to establish later in life. One man counted only two men he had met in his twenties as true friends because they had "an impact" on his life. That's a pretty high bar. Acquisitive people, by contrast, collect a variety of friends as they move through life. They are open to meeting new people, but keep up old relationships, too. "Unless you make friends, you're isolated," one such woman told Matthews. "You have to make a conscious effort."6 (Page 143)
- Only one of the several theories proposed to explain these cultural differences stands up to scrutiny and it concerns economic and political uncertainty. "Material help among friends becomes more important in societies where daily life is more uncertain," Hruschka says. (Page 145)
- It seems that if you smile, indeed, the world smiles with you. Daily exposure to small moments of happiness-your neighbor shouting a jolly hello, the barista remembering your name and your order, beginning your workday with a chat with a colleague about your favorite television show-can combine to raise our mood. Christakis and Fowler found that happiness is slightly more contagious than unhappiness (Page 153)
- Jeff Hall, a professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas, has looked extensively at gender differences in friendship. "Men's and women's [styles of] intimacy are different, but men's and women's satisfaction are not that different, and the value of friendship is not that different," he says. "Men and women define the importance of friendship in a very similar fashion. They want to have friends who are authentic and loyal and trustworthy equally." (Page 157)
- Hall has a theory that the conversations that bond us to others require emotional energy. "They also take time and they come with risk," he says. We are willing to take that risk, Hall believes, in order to satiate our need to belong, the very idea put forward by Baumeister and Leary. Once that evolutionary need is met, we begin to conserve energy--to talk less, engage less. Ultimately, we privilege the relationships that offer the most bang for our energetic buckthose that make us feel the greatest sense of belonging-and we engage in the type of talk that gets us there. It isn't enough to want friendships. "You have to spend time investing in people," Hall says. "It's important to keep it in mind as a priority. It's clear that many, many adults don't feel they have a lot of time, but if we do not prioritize these relationships they are not going to develop." (Page 162)
- Given what we know so far, what I have to say is this: friendship real friendship, hasn't changed much. It is alive and well, even in some senses. That said, just as we have to be sure to make time for friendship in our busy lives, we would do well to remember how important face-to-face interaction is in cultivating and maintaining relationships. Proximity matters. (Page 166)
- "Using social media is essentially a tradeoff," Hancock says. "You get very small but significant advantages for your well-being that come with very small but statistically significant costs." What's more, the overall effect on wellbeing, meaning the amount of variation among individuals that could be attributed to technology use when all effects were combined, was “essentially zero," Hancock says. To be specific, it was 0.01 on a scale in which 0.2 is considered a small effect size.5 (Page 167)
- "We're talking about a network of relationships that are maintained through multiple media. We talk to them on the phone, we see them in person. We share emails with them. And we are friends on Facebook," Hampton says. The more media we use to maintain a relationship, the stronger that bond is likely to be. (Page 174)
- Adult fears about our children's time online is one of the areas where we would do well to take a step back and look more carefully at what we are objecting to-Is there friendship there, as there was with my son Jake and his friend Christian when I got home from Puerto Rico? Or is a child only ever playing games alone? Does a fifteen-year-old girl spend the morning texting but then meet those same friends at the mall or on the soccer field? Or does she stay home passively scrolling through her phone? The difference could be significant. Pediatricians are beginning to see troublesome social media use as part of larger syndromes rather than as a problem by itself. (Page 179)
- I know all too well how much my family members' mood swings influence my own mood, and undoubtedly tip over into my physiology, at times causing my adrenaline to spike and my pulse to pound.
  Friendship has the same power. It serves an elemental need to belong and triggers physical pleasure and pain to make us pay attention to that need.

- "It's getting at some sort of experiential richness," says Wheatley. "Friends are literally seeing and hearing the world more similarly than people who are friends of friends, and friends of friends of friends. It's coming down to the level of how you're processing sights and sounds. Given a music video, if you and I find some part of the melody or some part of the visuals particularly engaging, then we're going to tune our eyes and ears to those parts. That's remarkable." (Page 223)
- "There are advantages to surrounding yourself with similar others," Parkinson says. "Potentially, people [who are alike] might share similar goals and assumptions and experiences and that could help foster cohesion, empathy and collective action. It's interesting to think about." (Page 223)
- Did they start out similar-both finding the Australian comedy hilarious? Or did one person's impassioned arguments on behalf of the environment change how someone else looked at those photographs of pollution seen from space? It seems very likely that the effect must go both ways. We may well be drawn to those who process the world in much the same manner as we do, but our minds might also be changed, literally, by our subsequent association with those people. (Page 224)
- but they did arrive at a preliminary finding: conversations rated more fun by the speakers are marked by rapid turn-taking. "We think it is an honest signal of engagement and shared understanding," Wheatley says. (Page 225)
- A good conversation, says Wheatley, means creating something new together. "It's a walk in the woods and you don't know where you're ending up. You're creating new ideas together and experiences you couldn't have gotten to alone." (Page 226)
- Three decades of subsequent work have only reiterated the importance of that early finding. "The most important thing about social relationships is just how critically important and valuable they are," Seeman says. "Earlier in life, being married-that relationship-is really key, but as you get older friendships become that much more important and whether or not you're married is relatively less important." This is good news. Even if you lose a spouse, friendships can sustain you. And you can keep making new friends throughout your life. (Page 233)
- She also knew that he had gone on to find that while loneliness and other forms of adversity increase susceptibility to inflammation and viral infection, social integration and feeling fulfilled seem to have the opposite effect, improving the immune system's ability to fight off those ills.6 (Page 238)
- The friendships appear to be a critical piece of the program, but not because the Gen X volunteers are thrown together and told to interact but rather because they are engaged in a meaningful endeavor designed to bring them together with a shared goal. (Page 238)
- In the early 1990s, Carstensen published an influential theory focused on time and how we want to spend it. When time is of the essence, she argues, the motivation to derive emotional meaning from life increases. What that means for social relationships, she found, is that while social networks do get smaller as we age, that narrowing is in large part intentional. People choose to spend time with those they really care about: they choose quality over quantity. It is people from the outer circles who are pared away. Furthermore, while family members are most likely to fill that inner circle, nonkin-friends-regularly do so in the absence of family. Again, what matters is the tenor of the relationship, not its origin. With fewer professional and family obligations, there are more hours for the things we want to do and the people with whom we want to do them. (Page 240)
- "What can humans take away from this work?" I ask.
  She throws back her head and lets out a rich laugh.
  "Hug each other more."
  I laugh, too. Could it really be so simple?
  "The vast majority of work done on social behavior shows you how important bonds are and how important body contact is and actually sitting together on the sofa. We need to preserve the time to do that. To sit together and read a book to your child or grandchild," Fischer says. "It's old primate heritage, the whole bonding issue." (Page 241)
- A person with severe dementia is still alive, but the relationship you had with them is not. (Page 241)
- In both adolescence and old age, having friends was associated with a lower risk of physiological problems, and the more friends you had, the lower the risk. In other words, there was a doseresponse relationship. By contrast, adults in middle age were less affected by variation in how socially connected they were. But the quality of their social relationships-whether friendships provided support or added strain-mattered more. (Page 243)
- Holt-Lunstad has not been shy about declaring how critical it is that social connection and loneliness be regarded as a public health issue. "For too long, this has been regarded as essential to emotional wellbeing but not necessarily physical well-being and longevity," she told me when we met in her office at Brigham Young with mountains filling the window behind her. "People view relationships as something that is personal and emotional, not so related to the body." (Page 246)
- But what if friendship and social connection were a consideration for policy makers? "If our goal is not to invent new relationships necessarily, but to help foster the kinds of natural relationships people have in their lives and not be destructive of them, what would we be doing?" Lisa Berkman asks. "We would have family friendly policies. We would not move people across the country so that there's a lot of geographic dislocation. We would encourage voluntary activities, and community cohesion, and neighborhoods [where] people are naturally likely to be in contact with each other. It's those kinds of policies, at either a company level, or a state, or city level that actually have the biggest impact on social isolation." (Page 247)
- We must make friendship a priority and factor it in to the way we plan our time--and our children's time. Yes, you can choose your friends, but you must also more generally choose friendshipembrace it, invest in it, work at it. Put time and attention into building quality relationships. Be mindful of your social convoy. You cannot afford not to. (Page 248)
- Bock's original grand intention was to focus not on ill health but on what it took to live well. And decades later, the answer was quite clear. In 2008 longtime study director George Vaillant was asked, "What have you learned?" His response was emphatic: "That the only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people." (Page 250)

Based on your highlights from Lydia Denworth's *Friendship*, here are the key arguments and takeaways from the book:

### 1. **Friendship as Essential for Survival**
   - Denworth argues that friendship has survival value in a very literal sense: people who are socially integrated live longer and have better health than those who are not. This view is grounded in evolutionary biology and social science.
   - From an evolutionary perspective, the development of social bonds like friendship is linked to survival and reproduction. Friendship is a mechanism that enhances individual fitness, both directly (through cooperation and resource sharing) and indirectly (through reciprocal altruism and social integration).

### 2. **Evolutionary and Biological Perspectives on Friendship**
   - Friendship and social bonding have a biological basis, evident not only in humans but also across many animal species. This suggests that the need for social bonds is deeply ingrained.
   - The emotional and physiological aspects of friendship are tied to evolutionary adaptive value—friendship helps individuals feel secure, supported, and provides resilience in times of stress.
   - Social bonds appear to influence gene expression and immune function, indicating that friendship contributes to physical as well as emotional well-being.

### 3. **Attachment and Emotional Connection**
   - Drawing on attachment theory, Denworth shows that friendship involves attachment behaviors throughout the lifespan, not just between parents and children. This type of attachment helps individuals cope during times of illness, stress, or danger.
   - Emotional support, empathy, and reciprocal altruism are critical components of friendships. These elements help form the core of the emotional bonds that define friendship.

### 4. **Types of Friendship and Their Benefits**
   - Denworth categorizes friendships into different types, such as independent, discerning, and acquisitive, noting that people's style of friendship varies based on personality and life circumstances.
   - Friends provide different kinds of support: emotional, instrumental (practical help), and informational. Each of these contributes to a person's sense of well-being and security.
   - The benefits of friendship extend beyond mental health; they also improve physical health, helping reduce inflammation and boost immune response.

### 5. **Social Integration as Public Health**
   - Denworth emphasizes that the need for social connection is increasingly being recognized as a public health issue, similar to smoking cessation or nutrition. Loneliness and social isolation can have significant negative impacts on health, and friendships can mitigate these effects.
   - Quality of friendships is crucial—ambivalent or negative relationships can be harmful to health, while supportive and strong social bonds help people thrive both mentally and physically.

### 6. **The Complexity and Importance of Play**
   - Play is a key element in the development and maintenance of friendships, especially in childhood and adolescence. Play helps individuals learn about cooperation, trust, and boundaries in a low-stakes context, which translates to better social behaviors in adulthood.
   - Even in the animal kingdom, play is seen as an important behavior that supports survival by teaching young animals judgment and social skills.

### 7. **The Evolutionary Roots and Modern Implications of Friendship**
   - Evolution has selected for the ability to form and maintain friendships as these relationships increase the chance of survival and reproductive success. This notion applies to both humans and other social animals, such as primates.
   - Denworth challenges the cultural bias that friendships are secondary to family ties; friendships can be just as important as familial relationships in sustaining well-being, particularly in old age.

### 8. **Impact of Technology and Changing Dynamics of Friendship**
   - Denworth acknowledges that technology and social media are reshaping how friendships form and are maintained. She argues that these changes are not inherently negative, but that we must be intentional in how we use technology to sustain real, meaningful connections.
   - There is evidence that using multiple forms of communication (e.g., in-person, phone, social media) can strengthen friendships. The key is to balance digital and face-to-face interactions.

### 9. **Sociocultural and Economic Factors**
   - Friendship is shaped by cultural and economic contexts. In societies with greater economic uncertainty, friendships often take on a more practical role of material support.
   - Denworth argues that policies should consider the importance of social bonds—family-friendly policies, reduced geographic dislocation, and community building are essential to foster strong social networks.

### 10. **Practical Takeaways on Maintaining Friendships**
   - Denworth stresses the importance of investing time and effort into friendships to maintain their quality. Friendships require care, attention, and sometimes work to sustain.
   - As people age, they tend to prioritize fewer but deeper relationships, focusing on quality over quantity.

### Key Quotes and Concepts
- "A friend is another self." Denworth underscores the emotional closeness of friends and how they share perspectives and experiences.
- Friendship provides a critical source of "social buffering" during stressful times, helping people cope and ultimately leading to better long-term health.
- The concept of "tend and befriend," especially in females, is a nurturing response that contrasts with the classic fight-or-flight reaction, highlighting the evolutionary importance of care and connection.

### Reflection and Next Steps
Denworth's *Friendship* provides a multidimensional perspective on why friendships are crucial for survival, well-being, and evolutionary success. It underscores that friendships are not simply emotional extras but fundamental to our biological and social needs.

Reflect on how friendships in your own life contribute to both your mental and physical well-being. How can you prioritize and invest more intentionally in those relationships? Also, consider what social structures around you—such as community activities or digital tools—might help foster stronger connections. This reflection could help reinforce the key takeaways from the book in your personal context.
