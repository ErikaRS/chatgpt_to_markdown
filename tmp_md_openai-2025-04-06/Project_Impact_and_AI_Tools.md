Create a "not meeting expectations" and "great" answer 2-3 sentence description for each of these questions based on the short goal listed. 

Question: What's a project that you worked on that was successful but would not have been successful—or have been notably less successful—without your contributions? Describe the project, your contributions, and how those contributions made the project successful? Follow-up: Describe the technical stack that you used? 

Goal: Can they actually find a project where their impact was critical? Can they describe the project well? Do they understand their impact? Can they talk effectively about the the tech stack?
 
Question: Have you used Cody or other AI coding assistants? Tell me your thoughts about these sorts of tools. Follow-up (if they only covered positive things): What limitations do you see with these tools? What concerns do you have?

Goal: Get a sense of if they're excited working in our space or if it's just a generic area for them. Looking for signs that they have thought about these tools, both good and bad.

### Question 1: Successful Project and Contributions

**Not Meeting Expectations:**  
"I worked on a project to implement a new API. It was a team effort, and I just did my part writing some of the endpoints. The project went well because the whole team was good. We used Python and Django."  
*(This response lacks specifics about the project, their unique contributions, and how those contributions impacted success. The description of the tech stack is superficial.)*

**Great:**  
"I led the migration of our payment processing system to a more scalable architecture. My key contribution was designing and implementing a queuing mechanism that handled high transaction volumes without downtime. This change significantly improved reliability and reduced processing delays by 50%. We used a stack including Python, Celery, PostgreSQL, and AWS SQS to build the solution."  
*(This response clearly identifies their critical impact, describes the project effectively, and explains the technical stack in detail.)*

### Question 2: Thoughts on AI Coding Assistants

**Not Meeting Expectations:**  
"I’ve used Cody a little. It’s okay but not something I use often. I don’t have strong thoughts about it."  
*(This response suggests a lack of engagement or thought about the tools or the broader space.)*

**Great:**  
"I’ve used Cody and similar tools extensively. I find them invaluable for generating boilerplate code and catching edge cases I might miss. That said, they can sometimes suggest overly generic solutions that don’t account for nuanced requirements, so I always verify their output. I’m fascinated by how these tools can enhance developer productivity but also think they raise interesting challenges, like preventing over-reliance on AI or addressing potential biases in the models."  
*(This response shows excitement for the space, thoughtful engagement with both benefits and limitations, and a clear interest in the topic.)*
