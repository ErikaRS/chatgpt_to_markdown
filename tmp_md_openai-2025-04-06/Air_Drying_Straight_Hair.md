To air dry your hair straight without frizz, you can use the following techniques:

### Preparation
1. **Use a Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner**: Choose products designed to reduce frizz and enhance smoothness.
2. **Gently Squeeze Out Excess Water**: Use a microfiber towel or cotton T-shirt to gently pat your hair dry without rubbing, as rubbing can cause frizz.

### While Hair is Wet
3. **Apply a Leave-In Conditioner or Smoothing Cream**: Focus on the mid-lengths and ends to reduce frizz and add weight to your hair.
4. **Comb with a Wide-Tooth Comb**: This helps distribute products evenly and detangles your hair without causing breakage.

### Drying Process
5. **Use the Tension Method**: 
   - While your hair is still damp, part it into sections.
   - Smooth each section between your fingers, gently pulling it straight as it dries.
   - You can also use a soft boar-bristle brush to help hold the hair straight.

6. **Secure Hair with Clips**: 
   - Divide your hair into sections and pin each section flat to your scalp using duckbill or flat clips.
   - This keeps the hair stretched and straight while it dries naturally.

7. **Avoid Touching Your Hair**: Once styled, avoid touching your hair as it dries to minimize frizz.

### After Drying
8. **Finish with a Lightweight Oil or Serum**: Once your hair is fully dry, apply a small amount of anti-frizz serum or lightweight oil to tame flyaways and add shine.

By controlling the drying process and maintaining tension in the hair, you can reduce frizz and encourage straighter drying.
