To estimate the worth of Scrooge McDuck’s vault of money, we can make a few assumptions based on popular depictions of the character. Scrooge McDuck’s vault is often portrayed as containing a large volume of gold coins.

The most common estimate is that the vault contains **3 cubic acres** of gold coins. A cubic acre is a volume measure, and one cubic acre equals approximately 43,560 cubic feet. So, 3 cubic acres would be about **130,680 cubic feet**.

Next, we can assume the coins are made of gold, as gold is often portrayed in these vault scenes. The density of gold is about **1,206 pounds per cubic foot**, meaning Scrooge's vault would hold approximately **157,575,080 pounds** of gold.

As of today, gold is valued at around **$1,900 per ounce**. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so:

\[
157,575,080 \times 16 = 2,521,201,280 \text{ ounces}
\]

\[
2,521,201,280 \times 1,900 = \approx 4.79 \text{ trillion dollars}
\]

Thus, Scrooge McDuck’s vault would be worth approximately **$4.79 trillion** in today's US dollars if it's filled with gold.
