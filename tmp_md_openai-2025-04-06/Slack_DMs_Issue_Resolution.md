Make this more concise: Inspired by but tangential to @Dan Adler's question about Slack retention: I've been hearing a lot of feedback recently that we are having too many DMs. These are problematic because it leads to redundant conversations, makes things harder to find, and is not consistent with out culture of direct and transparent conversations. 

One concrete example: @Ryan Phillips said he had 8 different DMs related to Search Suite planning when he got back from his PTO and was having trouble keeping track of who knew what. Another example, planning related, I found myself unable to search for DMs involving @csells or @stevey because I had too many DMs involving each of them.

First, I'd love to get input from this group if they have heard or felt similar pains. (Maybe it's just an engineering / product / design problem).

Second, if we agree this is something we'd push back on, I'd love to coordinate on a message we could give the company to make it clear that channels are preferred to group DMs and reminding people of the tools they have available (e.g., use a #team- or #discuss- channel or create a temporary #wg- channel). This could also be a good opportunity to remind people that while open channels are the default, channels can be made private when teams feel it's more appropriate.

Thoughts?

Regarding Slack usage, there's been feedback about excessive DMs causing redundancy, hindering searchability, and not aligning with our culture of transparency. For instance, @Ryan Phillips had 8 DMs about Search Suite planning after his PTO, making it hard to track information. I also faced search difficulties due to numerous DMs with @csells and @stevey.

First, I'd like your input on whether you've experienced similar issues.

If so, let's discuss a company-wide message promoting the use of channels over group DMs. We can also remind everyone of available tools like #team- or #discuss- channels and encourage private channels when necessary.

Thoughts?
