A process in the context of a business or organization refers to a series of interconnected activities or tasks that are performed in a specific sequence to achieve a particular goal or output. These processes are designed to streamline operations, enhance efficiency, and ensure consistency in delivering products or services. Key characteristics of a business or organizational process include:

1. **Input and Output:** Each process has defined inputs (resources such as materials, information, or human effort) and outputs (the result or product of the process).

2. **Sequence of Activities:** The process consists of a set of activities or tasks that are performed in a specific order.

3. **Purpose:** The process is designed to achieve a specific objective or outcome, such as producing a product, delivering a service, or completing a business function.

4. **Participants:** Various individuals or teams may be involved in executing the process, each with specific roles and responsibilities.

5. **Resources:** The process utilizes resources, which can include personnel, equipment, technology, and materials.

6. **Rules and Policies:** Processes are governed by rules, policies, and procedures to ensure consistency, compliance, and quality.

7. **Performance Metrics:** Processes are often measured and monitored using key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate efficiency, effectiveness, and improvement areas.

Examples of business or organizational processes include order processing, customer service, product development, marketing campaigns, and financial reporting.

ESSAY:
All organizations have processes, officially codified ways of doing things or shadow processes – the real way to get things done even if it goes outside of (or even against) the official process. The best processes streamline work, increase efficiency, and encourage consistency. However, processes often become tedious overhead. People go through the motions to get the end they want, but it would have been efficient for everyone involved if they could skip the unnecessary steps. 

Useful processes increase efficiency or motivation. They are often designed for the person who is enacting them. When self-designed, we often call these routines or habits. Whether self-designed or designed by others, good processes reduce the overhead of getting things done.

Overhead processes, the kind that induce frustration, often arise when the process is designed for someone else. For example, processes that exist primarily to benefit others – the boss, the auditor, the committee – tend to become overhead. Some overhead may be necessary. For example, when handling sensitive data, the net benefits of auditing outweigh the overhead of accessing the data in an auditable way. However, processes that are designed to make observers happy rarely bring joy to the person wading through them.

However, the most effective process is not really a process at all. Structure can replace explicit processes in a way makes them almost unnoticeable. For example, the culinary practice of mise en place involves intentionally creating structure in a kitchen to support high quality, efficient work. When it’s designed with the work in mind, structure supports and enables the worker.

Standardizing structure can go even further. It can replace extra work or communication overhead associated with processes designed for others with a self-service model. If everyone tracks their work in a well defined place with common standards and is updating it on a shared cadence, then people who want to know what’s going on can simply reference the tracking artifacts. This won’t always work. Standardized issue tracking might enable teams to collaborate more effectively on shared work, but the CEO will still need a distilled summary. However, they can replace numbing status meetings that just rehash the data that’s available elsewhere… if only anyone knew where. 

Structure can support automation. When data is produced in the same format and in known locations, people can start building views or automated processes on top of them. This can be a powerful way to reduce toil. 

Just as with any other type of process, too much structure can become a trap. Yet as long as it stays anchored in the work, structure can increase effectiveness without feeling like a process at all.
