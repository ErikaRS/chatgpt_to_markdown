Here is an article. Don't comment on it yet. I'll be sharing more info

üß† üß∞ A toolbox for guiding problem solving
Sometimes you are solving a problem directly. Other times, you are setting up the environment in which others will solve a problem. What‚Äôs the best way to set others up for success? The default answer, at least in organizational settings, is to create a process. When people need to accomplish a task, they pull out the process definition, go through the steps, and successfully accomplish their task. 
But is process always the right answer? It certainly has something of a bad rap. Process is the realm of pointless bureaucracy where you have to submit a form to get a new pen. It‚Äôs the realm of suppressed creativity where you have to stick to a certain narrative structure because that‚Äôs what is required by the assignment. However, processes can help procedures like surgeries to be more successful by ensuring that the right actions are taken in the right order. 
Instead of looking at processes as the way to enable others to solve problems, we can broaden our problem solving toolbox. Let‚Äôs look  at organizational problem solving through the lens of the cynefin framework, which describes problems as simple (a.k.a. clear), complicated, complex, or chaotic. Each of these contexts can yield a different tool to add to our toolbox. 
For simple problems, a process feels like overhead. Getting paid can be a tedious process of recording and submitting hours, requesting pay, getting a physical check, and depositing it. For a frequent task like this, it can be valuable to add structure. When we create a structure to solve a problem, we shift the burden from people having to think about what to do to having it built into the environment we work in. For the paycheck example, replacing manual time entry with a ‚Äúclock in / clock out‚Äù mechanism, automatically submitting hours, and direct deposit replaces a manual process with a low effort structure.  (This example points out an interesting asymmetry: problems don‚Äôt present the same level of challenge to everyone involved. Getting a paycheck should be simple. Managing payroll, on the other hand, is complicated.) 
As we move into the realm of complicated problems, we see where processes can be effective. A process can help people systematically go through the steps needed to solve the problem.  For example, when an employee is hired, there‚Äôs a fairly standard procedure to follow, but there are often variations that make each employee‚Äôs onboarding unique: they need to start on an atypical day; they need special equipment; they are going on leave 2 weeks after their start date; etc. A process helps people gather the data they need, analyze it systematically, and develop the right solution.
When it comes to helping people solve complex problems, things get harder. By their very nature, we can‚Äôt encode the right answer to a complex problem in a structure or give a step by step process for how to figure things out. We can‚Äôt even be sure that there is a right answer. The tool we can give people solving a complex problem is context. They will need to navigate this unknown landscape on their own, but we can tell them everything we know about it. For example, a product manager who needs to come up with a roadmap for a product whose growth is flattening needs to know about the current user base and why they use the product, potential user bases, things the company has tried in the past that did and did not work, and much more. 
When things get chaotic, even context is not sufficient because what was true yesterday may have very little bearing on what is true today. In chaotic situations, the best we can do is arm people with probing tools. We can give people the means to learn about what is currently true in their environment. For example, in the midst of a contentious merger, we might advise people to spend less time on formal, structured presentations and instead have many small conversations to learn how different stakeholders are thinking about priorities.   
When we find ourselves in a position where we need to enable others to solve problems, we can resist the instinct to define a process and instead ask ourselves about the nature of the challenge. Is this a problem we can solve by putting a simple structure in place, like a template or an automated process? Is it a creative or innovative challenge where we should provide context about the environment so they can explore effectively? Is this a shifting and dynamic challenge where we should teach people how to be aware of the shifting sands? If so, then there are better solutions than process. However, when the challenge we are faced with is one of navigating through a space of varied but understood solutions, then a process may be exactly what you need.

Here is a second article. Don't comment yet. I'll be giving more information.

This week‚Äôs lens: extrusion.

In manufacturing, extrusion is the process of forming a desired shape out of a malleable material such as metal or plastic by pushing it through a die. The die looks like the inversion of the final product‚Äôs cross section. If we want to extrude a rectangular bar, the die must have a rectangle-shaped hole.

This idea of a hole that defines the final shape of the product can serve as a metaphor for problem-solving.

When solving problems, a classic approach is to form a hypothesis of a solution and then see if the problem fits the solution. This approach works well when we have a good mental model of the problem and have high confidence that our hypothesis (or several of them) will land us pretty close to the perfect solution.

When we don‚Äôt have such confidence, our hypotheses are just shots in the dark. We need to take a different approach. We need some way to increase our luck.  

This is where an extrusion-inspired approach comes in. Here, we imagine that we are like molten metal or polymer that is flowing toward the die that represents the shape of the solution.  Our job is to simply apply pressure ‚Äì exploratory efforts ‚Äì and let the die of the problem inform us of the shape of the solution. We need to hold loose our preconceptions of what the final outcome might be ‚Äì until the die starts extruding the solution. It is on us to sense the pressure of the die around the outline of the solution, be fluid, and react accordingly.

At first, it might look like just starting to build and sensing what‚Äôs hard and what‚Äôs easy. In software engineering, we might start writing code to make something work, and then iteratively explore what‚Äôs possible until the final algorithm of the solution we sought starts to emerge. In product management, it might be applying a keen eye to the reactions we get from our users and looking for what resonates and what seems to fall flat. 

Solving problems by extrusion requires a particular skill. In this process, we need to stay nimble and let go of the idea that we have the answers. Instead, we need to let our environment teach us these answers. We need to let the extrusion take place.

Now, looking at both of these, what are ways we can tweak each one to make them "sing" together. Don't give literal edits. Just give a list of suggestions of changes can be made

### Assistant - 2023-10-31 20:17:43

Certainly! Here are suggestions to make the two articles "sing" together:

1. **Unified Framework**:
   - Introduce a shared terminology or framework that both articles can reference. For instance, you could classify problem-solving techniques into categories like "Process-driven," "Context-driven," "Exploratory," etc., and then link these to the concepts in both articles.

2. **Common Metaphors**:
   - Blend the metaphors. For instance, you could compare the "die" in extrusion to the "structure" in the first article. Both serve to guide a material or process to a desired outcome.

3. **Consistent Structure**:
   - Ensure that both articles have a similar flow. Begin with an introduction, delve into the core content, and conclude with a summary or actionable insights.

4. **Cross-Referencing**:
   - Occasionally reference concepts from one article in the other. For instance, while discussing the "extrusion-inspired approach" in the second article, you might mention how it contrasts with the "process-driven" approach of the first.

5. **Shared Examples**:
   - Use consistent or complementary examples. If one article talks about software engineering or product management, consider incorporating those examples into the other article as well.

6. **Unified Tone and Style**:
   - Ensure both articles have a similar tone, whether it's formal, conversational, or instructive. This helps create a seamless reading experience.

7. **Integrated Visuals (if applicable)**:
   - If there are any visual aids, ensure they have a consistent design language. Perhaps diagrams that show how the "process" and "extrusion" methods operate side by side.

8. **Common Conclusion**:
   - Conclude both articles by emphasizing the importance of flexibility in problem-solving and the value of having multiple tools or approaches at one's disposal.

9. **Shared Call to Action**:
   - End both articles with a similar call to action or question, urging readers to reflect on their problem-solving techniques and consider blending different approaches.

10. **Highlight Differences for Clarity**:
   - While the goal is to make them harmonize, it's also essential to clearly distinguish the unique value each approach offers. This can be done through contrasting sections or sidebars.

11. **Integrate Real-world Applications**:
   - Weave in real-world scenarios where each method (process or extrusion) has been applied successfully. This offers readers tangible evidence of each approach's efficacy.

By implementing these suggestions, the two articles can be made to complement each other, providing readers with a comprehensive and harmonious understanding of the diverse problem-solving landscape.
