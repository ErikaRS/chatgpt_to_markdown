Jonathan dancy on moral particularism: what is a good entry point into these ideas?

Jonathan Dancy's moral particularism argues against the idea that moral judgment can be governed by a fixed set of principles or rules. Instead, it emphasizes the unique details of each situation, claiming that moral reasons can change depending on the context. A good entry point into Dancy's ideas would be his book "Ethics Without Principles." Reading academic papers or watching interviews where he discusses his views can also provide a solid introduction.
