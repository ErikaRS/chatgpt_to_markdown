Copy edit and round out this article:
We all have behaviors or beliefs that are not serving us well… sometimes we even know it. For example, a leader may say that they want to delegate to others but not micromanage but then find themselves lost in the details despite their best intention. When we find ourselves in possession of an idea that runs counter to our stated goals, it may feel easy to dismiss. Our hypothetical leader may say, “I value autonomy and know that I can’t handle all the details myself, so clearly, this was just a special case.” 

However, when we find ourselves in these situations, especially when we find ourselves repeatedly acting in ways that run counter to our professed preferences, it’s worth asking ourselves where this pattern comes from. Usually we will find that both the professed preference and the revealed preference are serving us in some way. Until we understand the ways they are serving us, we won’t be able to find a path forward.

What does it mean to say that a belief, professed or revealed, is serving us in some way? It means that we’re getting some value out of that belief, even if it’s one we don’t acknowledge. Sometimes, that value will be obvious: maybe micromanaging makes us feel more in control or like we’re reducing risk. Perhaps professing the value of autonomy helps us see ourselves as the sort of leader we believe is admirable. 

The more interesting value, however, often comes from digging deeper. Maybe we find ourselves digging into the details because sometimes we need to revive our sense of domain competence. Maybe we find it fun and we need a break from what has become the stressful, unsatisfying day-to-day of our role. As with all self-reflection, we need to make sure we’re avoiding creating fictional answers out of thin air. However, approached with a strong focus on what truly resonates, we may find something surprising.

Finding the ways that our beliefs serve us opens the door for creative possibilities. Maybe the solution to a leader’s micromanagement problem is finding someone they trust to delegate the domain to… but maybe the solution is for the manager to take on a project that they find personally interesting.

We all have behaviors or beliefs that do not serve us well. Sometimes, we even recognize this fact. For example, a leader may express a desire to delegate tasks and avoid micromanagement but still find themselves immersed in the details despite their best intentions. When we possess an idea that contradicts our stated goals, it may feel easy to dismiss it. Our hypothetical leader might think, “I value autonomy and know I can’t handle all the details myself, so clearly, this was just a special case.”

However, when we repeatedly act in ways that counter our professed preferences, it's worth examining where this pattern originates. Typically, both the professed preference and the revealed preference serve us in some way. Until we understand how they serve us, we won't be able to find a path forward.

What does it mean to say that a belief, whether professed or revealed, is serving us in some way? It means we derive some value from that belief, even if it's unacknowledged. Sometimes, this value is obvious: perhaps micromanaging makes us feel more in control or reduces perceived risk. Maybe professing the value of autonomy helps us view ourselves as the kind of leader we admire.

The more intriguing value often comes from deeper introspection. We might discover that we delve into details because it revives our sense of domain competence. Perhaps we find it enjoyable and need a break from the stressful, unsatisfying aspects of our role. As with all self-reflection, we must avoid fabricating answers. However, with a strong focus on what truly resonates, we might uncover something surprising.

Identifying the ways our beliefs serve us opens the door to creative possibilities. Maybe the solution to a leader’s micromanagement issue is finding a trusted person to delegate to, or perhaps the answer is for the leader to take on a personally interesting project. Understanding these dynamics allows us to create more effective strategies that align with our genuine needs and aspirations.

First lens:
🔍🔺 Lens of the week
Introducing new ways to see the world and new tools to add to your mental arsenal.

This week’s lens: Trilemma.

You and your project colleague are puzzling over a problem: the product you build is laser-focused on its users and what’s good for business, but there’s still insufficient lift to hit your goals. It’s almost like there is some other unseen force tugging at you. After a lot of whiteboarding, exhausted, it dawns on you: you forgot about the surrounding ecosystem. There aren’t two parts in this puzzle, but rather three. And you can only have your product focus on two of them at a time.

Welcome to the world of trilemmas. Trilemmas are like dilemmas, but instead of two unfavorable or mutually exclusive choices, there are three. Trilemmas typically represent impossible spaces: we want to satisfy all three conditions somehow but can only afford their subset.

Trilemmas are all around us. The infamous project management triangle is a trilemma: among scope, cost, and time, you can only pick two. There’s also Zooko’s triangle, which posits that a network protocol can only satisfy two of the desired constraints (memorable, secure, or decentralized).

Unlike some lenses, trilemmas don’t offer solutions or paths forward. Instead, they clarify the situation in a way that allows the participants in this situation to recognize and respect the impossibility of its full resolution.

Recognizing that the scope of a project can’t keep growing without impacting cost or time is a very valuable insight — and something that a skilled project manager will know by heart.

A good way to uncover a trilemma is to listen to an argument or discussion going in circles and try to discern a missing variable. If all assumptions in the conversation are implicitly based on different assumptions about the values of this variable, you might have a trilemma on your hands.

Second lens:
🔍📆 Lens of the week
Introducing new ways to see the world and new tools to add to your mental arsenal.

This week’s lens: reasoning by analogy.

We’ve discussed different types of formal reasoning before: inductive, abductive, and deductive. There’s a type of informal reasoning that’s just as common in most people’s toolboxes (if not more so) but comes with its own set of tradeoffs: reasoning by analogy. We reason by analogy when we take two separate things and reason about their similarities.

Reasoning by analogy can be extremely helpful. When our reasoning is blocked, analogy can help open up new possibilities. Thinking about the parallels between debugging a program and fixing a machine may lead us to think about how to break the system down into components and test those independently. It can also be valuable when explaining a new idea to someone. If we can find an analogy that connects the unfamiliar with the familiar, it can help them to grasp the unfamiliar more quickly. For all but the true quantum physicists, anything we think we know about quantum mechanics falls under reasoning by analogy. 

However, reasoning by analogy is also likely to mislead us. If life is like a box of chocolates, that doesn’t mean life is high in sugar and comes in a box. Or that life is full of random events that just happen to us. Taking quantum mechanical metaphors too literally is a source of many outlandish claims. And if we forget that computer programs are not mechanical machines, we may be surprised at the spooky action at a distance that occurs in programs.

If we’re careful not to abuse it, if we can make sure we understand what elements of similarity are helpful and which are incidental, then reasoning by analogy can be a great tool for expanding our reasoning repertoire from the formal to the creative.

Third lens: 🔍📆 Lens of the week
Introducing new ways to see the world and new tools to add to your mental arsenal.

This week’s lens: theory of change.

Suppose your team has a great idea for increasing product usage. It’s cool, users like it, and the implementation is slick and easy to use… and yet, nothing changes. The metrics stay stubbornly where they are. What happened? How did this great idea with excellent execution fail so utterly?

We may have failed to think through the theory of change associated with the idea. A theory of change connects an idea with the impact that it’s meant to have, breaking it down step by step: if this, then that. If that, then the goal. It forces us to outline our assumptions about how our idea will impact the system it’s a part of.

Articulating a theory of change is especially valuable when there are many good ideas without a clear focus. We often confuse the attractiveness of an idea with its effectiveness. Going along with an idea that feels like a positive change can be tempting. However, even if it’s positive, it can be useless if it doesn’t impact the right goals. Improving your hair care routine might be a good idea, but if your goal is to improve your dental health, it’s not an effective one. 

Although any given theory of change is likely wrong when confronted with reality, articulating a theory of change surfaces assumptions and provides opportunities to mitigate risks or, if needed, pivot entirely. If we can constantly update our theories of change in the face of new facts, then that value will be compounded.

Fourth lens: 🔍📆 Lens of the week
Introducing new ways to see the world and new tools to add to your mental arsenal.

This week’s lens: tourists and residents.

Imagine yourself in Indonesia, Senegal, or France. Do you imagine yourself as a tourist—exploring, discovering, maybe a little uncomfortable? Or do you imagine yourself as a resident—comfortable, efficient, maybe a little complacent? As residents, we are familiar with the norms of the culture and the lay of the land. As tourists, we bring a different perspective and are actively looking to have a new experience. 

When we springboard into a new role, a new group, a new hobby, or a new organization, we start off as tourists. Whatever norms and questions we were comfortable with would change to some degree. This isn’t a bad thing. The reason we engage in change often is motivated by the desire to expand our horizons. Many folks do post-undergraduate degrees in a different field with the understanding and goal of shifting from their established environment to becoming a tourist and learning something new. That something new may become a career change and new life journey, or they may take their new insights back “home” and reap the benefits of cross-pollination. 

It’s valuable to spend time in our lives as both tourists and residents. It’s also valuable to think about the distribution of residents and tourists within a particular group. Residents know an area with a depth that a tourist cannot replicate. They are the deep domain experts who can solve problems that no one else can. But if residents never get an infusion of new ideas and insights from tourists, they can become complacent. Ideally, there is a mix of residents and tourists, with any particular person taking on different roles at different times.

We can apply this ‘tourists and residents’ lens in our own lives. At a personal level, we can look at what part of our lives we reside in as residents and which we relate to as tourists and see if we are hitting the right balance. For organizations we are a part of, we can look at if we have the right balance. Then, if we find discrepancies, we can find ways to invest in balance, knowing that both modalities bring value.

Last lens: 🔍🧮 Lens of the week
Introducing new ways to see the world and new tools to add to your mental arsenal.

This week’s lens: trading zones.

Many goals can only be accomplished by bringing together different perspectives — be they practices, domains, or expertise. However, doing this well isn’t always straightforward. Different perspectives often bring different vocabularies, different mental models, and often different value structures. 

To mediate this gap, we need to form a trading zone that allows different perspectives to exchange information. The idea of a trading zone originates from places that would trade in goods even though they didn’t speak the same language. Potential traders needed a shared language to be able to transact. This could result in a pidgin, a set of shared words that got the job done without being a full language. Eventually, with enough trade, this could grow into a creole language that was a language in its own right. 

The same dynamic applies when different perspectives need to collaborate. Peter L. Galison wrote about this in his essay “Trading Zone: Coordinating Action and Belief.” Creating the first atomic bomb required people from the theoretical physics community, engineering community, and other fields. It was often hard for one person to learn everything needed, so a sort of pidgin was created to communicate in that trading zone. A key characteristic of these trading zones is that they allow groups to get the job done without having to learn everything about the concept. 

We can see trading zones everywhere, especially in cross-domain work — for example, the work technology teams do across product management, design, engineering, and other practices. This particular trading zone brings up an important failure mode: sometimes, a shared vocabulary can become too specialized. In software, this can manifest in using language that is technology-centric instead of associated with the language of the customer (domain-driven design) or outcome (jobs-to-be-done). 

When we are having trouble working with someone or another team, we should ask whether we are speaking the same language. If we are not, can we use or develop a shared language that encapsulates valuable concepts that we all need to know? This shared language won’t encompass everything, but it will be enough to share ideas and generate insights that can only come from collaborating across perspectives.

Now, here is a stub for a lens idea. Flesh it out into a lens in the style of the lenses above. The lens should be called "API naming" and treat APIs as a metaphor for how hard it is to change fundamental assumptions.

🗞📰  API / fundamental assumptions
It can be useful to use things that are clearly articulated and solidified into something explicit like an “API” that enshrines your fundamental world view. Discord started as a gamer’s tool and the API still calls Servers “Guilds” in the API. Humans are similar - it can be really hard to change your fundamental assumptions and it can take a lot to fix those changes. 

You could just change the name of the API - but to really shift it beyond just the surface its hard and takes a lot of shifts. 

Its also important to know what paradigm you are moving to. Being able to build something from a particular paradigm it comes with a bunch of decisions and things you dont have to spend energy on making those decisions.

🔍🗞 Lens of the week
Introducing new ways to see the world and new tools to add to your mental arsenal.

This week’s lens: API Naming and Fundamental Assumptions.

Think about the role of an API in software development. An API (Application Programming Interface) serves as a well-defined, stable interface for interacting with software components. It encapsulates and enshrines certain fundamental assumptions about how a system operates. These assumptions are deeply embedded and changing them is not a trivial task. This concept can be metaphorically extended to our personal and organizational mindsets.

Consider the example of Discord, which began as a tool for gamers. In its API, the term "Guilds" is still used to refer to servers, a relic from its origins. This naming persists even as Discord has expanded beyond gaming into broader communities. Changing this terminology isn't just a matter of updating documentation; it involves shifting a fundamental assumption embedded in the system's design and used by countless developers.

Humans and organizations are similar. Our fundamental assumptions, once established, are like the names in an API. They become hard to change because they form the basis of how we understand and interact with the world. Shifting these assumptions requires more than just a superficial change; it involves a comprehensive and often challenging transformation.

Changing the name of an API might seem straightforward, but it requires careful consideration of the broader implications and dependencies. Similarly, altering our fundamental assumptions involves a significant shift in our mental models and the paradigms we operate within. This transformation is difficult and requires a clear understanding of the new paradigm we aim to adopt.

It's crucial to recognize the paradigm we are moving towards. When building something within a particular paradigm, many decisions are already made, providing a stable foundation to work from. However, shifting to a new paradigm means re-evaluating and reconfiguring those foundational decisions.

In both software development and personal growth, understanding and articulating these fundamental assumptions — our "API names" — is vital. It helps us identify the core elements that shape our interactions and provides a roadmap for meaningful change. By acknowledging the difficulty of these changes and approaching them with a clear vision, we can more effectively navigate the complexities of transformation.
