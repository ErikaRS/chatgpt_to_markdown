We are working on defining interview questions for a values interview at a tech company. One of the values is "Dev love" (defined below). Brainstorm 20 questions that could be used to assess how a person scores on that value. Each answer should be accompanied by 1-3 sentences defining what a good answer looks like. 

The questions should not assume that someone has professionally worked on developer tools before. The questions should be applicable across a wide variety of roles (e.g., engineering, sales, customer success, UX, etc.). A good answer should require people to talk about their ideas and experiences, not just parrot the definition of the value.

Definition: 
Dev love: Everything we do is ultimately for devs (anyone who codes). Every dollar we earn comes from devs trying, using, loving, fighting for, and sharing our product. All Sourcegraph teammates code to better understand our users and customers and to do their job better (in ways that make sense for their role). Our long-term mission is to make it so everyone codes, not just the 0.1% of the world’s population who are devs—just like universal literacy.

Several of these questions assume that the candidate has worked on developer tools before. Give 5 more questions that would work for a candidate from any tech company, including ones working on consumer tools

### Assistant - 2023-08-15 16:40:20

Of course, let's craft questions that are more generalized and can be applicable for candidates from any tech background:

1. **Question:** How do you think the principles of coding and development can be applied or understood in roles or industries that aren't directly tech-focused?
   - *Good Answer:* Recognizing the systematic, logical, and problem-solving nature of coding, and how these principles can be universally beneficial.

2. **Question:** In your previous roles, how have you ensured that you understand the end-users of the products or services you worked on, even if they were not developers?
   - *Good Answer:* Emphasis on user research, feedback collection, and direct engagement to truly understand user needs and pain points.

3. **Question:** How would you explain the importance of coding literacy to someone unfamiliar with the tech world, perhaps in a consumer-oriented role or industry?
   - *Good Answer:* Drawing parallels with universal skills like reading and writing, highlighting how coding empowers individuals to create, problem-solve, and understand the digital world better.

4. **Question:** Think of a favorite consumer tool or app you use. How would a basic understanding of coding enhance your experience or appreciation of it?
   - *Good Answer:* Recognizing the complexities behind seemingly simple features, empathizing with challenges the developers might have faced, or suggesting improvements based on logical constraints.

5. **Question:** Describe a time when you collaborated with a team or individual from a very different discipline or background. How did you bridge the communication gap and ensure mutual understanding?
   - *Good Answer:* Active listening, patience, use of analogies or shared experiences, and emphasizing common goals to foster collaboration.

These questions aim to assess the candidate's alignment with the "Dev love" value without assuming they've directly worked on developer tools. Instead, they focus on the broader appreciation and understanding of coding and its significance in various contexts.
