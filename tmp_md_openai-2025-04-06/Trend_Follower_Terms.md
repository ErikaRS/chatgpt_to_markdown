A common term for someone who goes along with trends is a "**trend follower**." More colloquially, such a person might be called a "**bandwagoner**," meaning they jump on the bandwagon of whatever is popular. Another term is "**conformist**," which refers to someone who adapts their behavior or opinions to fit in with prevailing trends or norms, often without critically assessing them.
