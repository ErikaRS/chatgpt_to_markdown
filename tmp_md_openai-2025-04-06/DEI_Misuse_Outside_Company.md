What's an alternate way of phrasing "We're seeing some people outside the company interpret DEI in a variety of ways that do not align with what we feel is right" that focuses instead on how some people outside of the company are weaponizing DEI? But without saying something as triggering as weaponizing.

"Some individuals external to our organization are misusing DEI concepts in ways that diverge from our core values and intended objectives."

Are there companies that are switching from using DEI to using "equality of opportunity" or other similar alternatives?

Yes, some companies are shifting their focus from traditional DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives to emphasizing "equality of opportunity" or other similar concepts. This approach aims to create an environment where all individuals, regardless of their background, have equal access to opportunities and resources for growth and development. By focusing on creating a level playing field, these companies aim to promote fairness and reduce disparities in the workplace. However, it is important to note that each organization's approach may vary, and some may choose to incorporate elements of both DEI and "equality of opportunity" in their strategies.
