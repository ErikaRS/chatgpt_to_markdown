What are popular go libraries for building CLIs?

### Assistant - 2023-03-22 14:01:39

There are several popular Go libraries for building command-line interfaces (CLIs). Some of the most commonly used ones include:

1. Cobra: This is a popular CLI library that offers a simple interface for creating powerful modern CLI applications. It provides features such as command and flag handling, input validation, and help generation.

2. Viper: This is a library for working with configuration files and command-line arguments. It can be used in conjunction with Cobra to provide a complete CLI solution.

3. Kingpin: This is another powerful and easy-to-use CLI library that provides a concise and expressive syntax for defining commands and flags.

4. urfave/cli: This is a simple, fast, and modern CLI library that supports a wide range of features including subcommands, flags, and argument parsing.

5. cli/cli: This is a library for building command-line apps that is designed to be fast, easy to use, and modular. It supports subcommands, flags, and argument parsing.

These libraries can help you build robust, feature-rich command-line applications in Go with minimal effort.

Sort these values by relevance. I care more about animals than I care about fruit.
- apple: banana
- apple: monkey
- banana: cat
- apple: shoe
- shoe: cat
- cat: mouse

### Assistant - 2023-03-22 14:15:32

Here are the sorted values by relevance, based on the given criteria:

- cat: mouse
- banana: cat
- shoe: cat
- apple: monkey
- apple: banana
- apple: shoe

In this sorting, the items that are related to animals are given higher relevance than those related to fruits. Therefore, the values containing "cat" and "mouse" are ranked higher, followed by the value containing "banana" and "cat". The values containing only fruits, such as "apple: banana" and "apple: shoe", are ranked lower.

### User - 2023-03-22 14:15:54

Wait, so you think "shoe" is a fruit?

### Assistant - 2023-03-22 14:17:22

My apologies for the confusion. You are right that "shoe" is not a fruit, and it was a mistake on my part to include it in the list. 

Here's the revised sorting based on relevance, considering only the items related to animals:

- cat: mouse
- banana: cat
- shoe: cat
- apple: monkey

The items containing "cat" and "mouse" are given higher relevance, followed by the value containing "banana" and "cat", and then the value containing "shoe" and "cat". The value containing "apple" and "monkey" is ranked last since it does not relate to animals mentioned in the list. 

I apologize for the error in my previous response and any confusion it may have caused.

Sort these values by number of vowels. 
- apple: banana
- apple: monkey
- banana: cat
- apple: shoe
- shoe: cat
- cat: mouse

### Assistant - 2023-03-22 14:17:43

Here are the sorted values by number of vowels:

- apple: banana (8 vowels)
- shoe: cat (6 vowels)
- apple: monkey (6 vowels)
- cat: mouse (5 vowels)
- banana: cat (3 vowels)
- apple: shoe (3 vowels)

In this sorting, the items are ranked based on the total number of vowels in the string, regardless of the category. The value containing "apple: banana" has the highest number of vowels, followed by "shoe: cat" and "apple: monkey". The value containing "cat: mouse" has five vowels, and the value containing "banana: cat" has three vowels. The value containing "apple: shoe" also has three vowels, but it is ranked last due to its lower number of vowels compared to the other items.
