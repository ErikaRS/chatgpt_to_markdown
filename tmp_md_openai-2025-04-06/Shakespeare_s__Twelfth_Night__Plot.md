Certainly! "Twelfth Night, or What You Will" is one of William Shakespeare's romantic comedies. Here's a brief summary of the plot:

The play opens with a shipwreck off the coast of Illyria. Viola and her twin brother Sebastian are separated in the wreck, each believing the other to be dead. Viola disguises herself as a young man named Cesario and enters the service of Duke Orsino.

Duke Orsino is in love with the Countess Olivia, but she is mourning the recent deaths of her brother and father and has sworn off suitors. Orsino sends Cesario (Viola in disguise) to woo Olivia on his behalf. However, Olivia falls in love with Cesario instead.

Meanwhile, Viola has fallen in love with Duke Orsino, leading to a love triangle. 

At Olivia's household, her rowdy uncle, Sir Toby Belch, and his friend Sir Andrew Aguecheek, along with the maid Maria and the clown Feste, play pranks on Olivia's puritanical steward, Malvolio. They trick him into believing Olivia is in love with him, leading him to act foolishly and get imprisoned as a madman.

Sebastian, Viola's twin, arrives in Illyria and is mistaken for Cesario. Olivia, thinking he is Cesario, declares her love for him and they quickly marry.

The climax of the play occurs when both Sebastian and Cesario (Viola) appear together, revealing their true identities. Viola's disguise is uncovered, and she and Duke Orsino declare their love for each other. Olivia and Sebastian decide to remain married. Malvolio is released and vows revenge on his tormentors.

The play concludes with the various couples united, but there are lingering feelings of melancholy, particularly from Malvolio and Antonio, Sebastian's friend who helped him in Illyria.

The title "Twelfth Night" refers to the twelfth night after Christmas, known as the Feast of Epiphany, a time of revelry and merrymaking, reflecting the play's comedic and festive spirit.
