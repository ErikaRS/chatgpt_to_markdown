We will not be backfilling this role. We will expand the scope of the open Cloud Ops manager role to include the Dev Infra and Releases team. I will be interim manager of those teams. The Core Services team will move under Eric Shamow, combining with Cody Prime to form the Services team. 

Request for modification:
This may also be a good opportunity to reinforce your confidence in Eric. Keep it subtle since we don't want to detract from the overall message.

Make it sound a bit more excited than "full confidence". That sounds like what you say when you don't _really_ have confidence in someone but are obliged to say so.

The user prefers language that conveys genuine excitement and confidence when talking about leadership transitions, avoiding phrases like "full confidence" that may seem obligatory or insincere.

I’m genuinely excited about Eric stepping into this role—his leadership will be key in driving this team forward.
