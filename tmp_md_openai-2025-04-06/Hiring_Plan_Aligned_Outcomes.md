Now draft a hypothetical version of such a document. It is an engineering team developing an AI coding assistant that is serving both PLG and Enterprise customers. The PLG target audience is primarily a source of enterprise pipeline but also a way for the enterprise offering to be more appealing because the coding assistant will be the tool of choice for engineers. The current staffing limitation is that the team is focused on meeting the quality bar for table stakes work while also staffing strategic enterprise work. The team is leaving critical enterprise work such as support for additional editors, API support, and air gapped deployments on the table. The team is also under investing in developer oriented innovation work such as automation and additional context sources. Finally, the team has already made efforts to optimize the ability to execute such as updating the team structure, streamlining the planning process, moving more engineers to the AI coding assistant, and opening hiring for two manager positions for the teams.
