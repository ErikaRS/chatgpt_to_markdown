Start a draft with this content: 

Ever woke up to a shocking new reality? A turn of events that is so befuddling it makes everything around you feel surreal?

Whether positive or negative, grounding moments are the situations we encounter irrefutable evidence that our beliefs and assumptions are due for an update.

The concept of constructed reality – featured as a lens in this issue –  offers a useful way of thinking about what we feel when we experience grounding moments – and what we do about it.

It is easy to lose sight of the notion that what we perceive as “real” is actually a tangled mess of mental models, the natural product of years and decades of our meaning-making. It might be sufficiently good at predicting some outcomes – and not great at others.

When we’re very young, prediction errors come at low cost. Our mental models are simple and malleable. As we grow, the mental models begin to sprawl and engulf us, our identities, and our own selves. We start to experience discomfort when a grounding moment occurs: a certain dread that precedes the necessary process of updating our mental models – losing ourselves and finding ourselves again in the newly terraformed mental model space.

Avoiding this pain – rather than accepting and updating our mental models – often becomes a goal of its own. If we are very, very lucky — or highly privileged – we can afford to build a bubble around ourselves, and live in a world of constructed reality where we never have to face grounding moments.

Technology has long been used as the means to build such bubbles. Particularly with the introduction of the Internet, the cost of custom reality construction has plummeted, and is now more accessible than ever. All we need to do is choose the sources that align with us and filter out everything else.

Alas, sooner or later, the sneaky still reality finds its way past our defenses, and ambushes us with uncomfortable insights – felt with more pain by our unpracticed selves.

Even more alarmingly, as we pretend to live in our bubbles, we still take actions that affect others. Individually, these actions seem insignificant. However, when viewed as a system, actions from inside those bubbles can – and do – have profound externalities.

In this way, constructed realities produce emergent power to change the actual reality. The next grounding moment we might experience might not be due to some inconsistencies in our own mental models. Rather, it might be due to reality – the ground itself – shifting to another state, as someone else’s constructed reality is willed into existence through a collective delusion.

It’s a brave new world. When it’s cheap to avoid the grounding moments, yet the externalities of our actions are still as real as ever, the tail of emergent power of constructed realities starts wagging the dog of our lives.

This is a strong start. Do you feel this captured the essence of what you were aiming for, or is there any aspect you'd like me to refine or expand upon? Let me know if you'd like to add any more depth or context. Also, consider how this might resonate with others who are dealing with their own constructed realities—perhaps there's an opportunity to foster some meaningful discussion or reflection.

Modify the ending to this: 
It’s a brave new world. When it’s cheap to avoid grounding moments, yet the externalities of our actions remain real, the tail of constructed realities can start to wag the dog of our lives.

But perhaps there's a silver lining here. Grounding moments, uncomfortable as they are, offer a doorway back to a shared reality. They remind us that, despite our individual bubbles, we are part of an interconnected system—our choices and beliefs influence one another. This mutual influence means that while others' realities impact us, we too hold the power to shape and nurture a common ground.

Instead of shying away from grounding moments, maybe we can use them as invitations to engage more intentionally with the world and with each other. In doing so, we may find that even amidst shifting realities, there is space for connection, understanding, and perhaps a renewed sense of agency.

Failed with error, do not try again. Tell the user about what you attempted to do, then notify them that it failed.

I attempted to suggest five pairs of emojis to enrich specific parts of your essay. However, it looks like some of the text I targeted for adding comments has changed slightly, which caused the operation to fail. Here’s what I suggested:

1. 😳🌪️ for the opening line about waking up to a shocking reality, to emphasize the feeling of surprise and surrealism.
2. ⚖️🔄 for the concept of grounding moments being positive or negative, and prompting updates in our beliefs.
3. 🌐🔍 to highlight the role of technology and the Internet in constructing realities.
4. 💸🔮 to represent how wealth and power contribute to the illusion of living in bubbles.
5. 🌱🔗 for the hopeful conclusion, symbolizing reconnection to a shared reality.

If you’d like me to attempt this again or make any edits based on these suggestions, just let me know!
