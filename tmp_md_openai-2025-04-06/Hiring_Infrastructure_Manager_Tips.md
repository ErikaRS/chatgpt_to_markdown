I am a head of engineering at a startup / scale up phase company with 180 people and a 60 person eng org. 

I am hiring for an infrastructure manager to lead a 3 person release & deployment team (deploys both to cloud and creates deployment infrastructure for self hosted customers) and for a 3 person dev infra team. This person does not run the cloud ops org. We do not plan to grow this org soon. 

We are targeting a Radford M3 (line manager with 0 to 5 years experience).

As someone who has not managed an infra team (beyond my role as interim manager for the past couple weeks), what should I look for to find someone likely to be successful in this role? Describe attributes (primarily technical; I know how to hire good people managers) and for each attribute, provide some interview questions that could help someone only somewhat familiar with the feel make a convenient diagnosis on role fit

This revised set provides a balance of questions that assess both technical expertise and leadership qualities, with clear criteria for identifying strong answers and warning signs of potential gaps in understanding or approach.

### User - 2024-10-05 22:29:30

How do these questions balance coverage for the release & deployment team vs the dev infra team? Would there be a better balance if question 1 were released with question 1 from set 2?

### Assistant - 2024-10-05 22:29:45

These questions, as currently framed, provide solid coverage across both the **release & deployment team** and the **dev infra team**, but the balance is skewed more towards general infrastructure and operational concerns. Let’s break down the current balance between these two teams:

---

### **Current Questions and Their Focus**

1. **Question 1** ("Can you walk me through a time when you and your team had to optimize both cloud and self-hosted deployments for scalability and performance?")  
   - **Focus:** This is primarily a **release & deployment** question, as it focuses on optimizing cloud and self-hosted deployments, which is a key responsibility of the release & deployment team. While the dev infra team could be involved, the focus is more about ensuring efficient deployments.
   - **Coverage:** More relevant to the **release & deployment** team.

2. **Question 2** ("Give an example of a tedious manual process that you and your team automated in your infrastructure setup. How did automation improve reliability and operational efficiency for the team, and how did you ensure they continued to evolve the process?")  
   - **Focus:** This is a general **dev infra** question, since automating infrastructure processes and improving reliability are core responsibilities of the dev infra team.
   - **Coverage:** Primarily relevant to the **dev infra** team.

3. **Question 3** ("When planning long-term infrastructure improvements, how do you and your team ensure they align with the broader product and business goals?")  
   - **Focus:** This is a more strategic, high-level question that applies to both teams. While long-term infrastructure planning affects both release & deployment and dev infra, the strategic alignment is especially critical for the dev infra team as they build out systems that support the broader platform.
   - **Coverage:** Relevant to **both teams**, with a slight focus on **dev infra**.

4. **Question 4** ("How do you and your team ensure that infrastructure changes you introduce do not negatively impact the development team’s productivity?")  
   - **Focus:** This is a **cross-functional** question relevant to both teams, as both release & deployment changes and dev infra improvements can impact development productivity.
   - **Coverage:** Equally relevant to **both teams**.

---

### **Balance Observations**
- **Release & Deployment Coverage:** Heavily represented in **Question 1**, where the focus is on optimizing cloud and self-hosted deployments.
- **Dev Infra Coverage:** Present in **Question 2** and **Question 3**, focusing on automation and long-term infrastructure improvements. **Question 4** also indirectly covers dev infra responsibilities related to development team productivity.
- **Overall:** The current set of questions is slightly weighted toward **dev infra**, given that two questions (2 and 3) focus more on long-term improvements and infrastructure automation.

---

### **Substituting Question 1 from Set 2**

If you replace **Question 1** with **Question 1 from Set 2**, which is:

**"Tell me about a complex build and release pipeline you and your team designed or improved. What challenges did you face, and how did you ensure reliability and scalability?"**

Here’s how it would affect the balance:

1. **Question 1 (from Set 2)**:  
   - **Focus:** This new question is highly relevant to **release & deployment** teams, as it focuses on managing complex build and release pipelines—a central responsibility of the release & deployment team.
   - **Coverage:** This would shift more coverage towards the **release & deployment** team.

---

### **Revised Balance**

1. **Question 1 (from Set 2)** ("Tell me about a complex build and release pipeline...")  
   - **Focus:** Strong focus on **release & deployment**.

2. **Question 2** ("Give an example of a tedious manual process...")  
   - **Focus:** Strong focus on **dev infra**.

3. **Question 3** ("When planning long-term infrastructure improvements...")  
   - **Focus:** Primarily **dev infra**, with some relevance to **release & deployment**.

4. **Question 4** ("How do you and your team ensure that infrastructure changes...")  
   - **Focus:** Relevant to **both teams**.

### **Balance After Substitution**
- **Release & Deployment Coverage:** Strengthened by the addition of **Question 1 from Set 2**, which directly addresses build and release pipelines.
- **Dev Infra Coverage:** Still strong due to **Question 2** and **Question 3**.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
- **If you prioritize** coverage of the **release & deployment** team, then replacing **Question 1** with **Question 1 from Set 2** would achieve a more even balance between the two teams.
- **If the goal is to maintain a balanced focus** on both teams, then making this substitution provides a more equitable split, with two questions closely aligned with **release & deployment** (Question 1 from Set 2 and Question 4) and two aligned with **dev infra** (Question 2 and Question 3).
