If a song uses part of another song it is called sampling. If it's a remake it's a cover. What is it called if a song takes a melody, e.g. from a public domain piece of classical music, and creates a new song that significant builds on that melody?

When a song takes a melody from a public domain piece of classical music and creates a new song that significantly builds on that melody, it's often referred to as an "adaptation" or "arrangement." This term is used to describe a piece that has been significantly altered or reimagined from the original composition, while retaining core elements, such as the melody or harmonic structure. This practice is common in classical music but can be applied to any genre where an existing melody is reworked into a new composition.

Is there a more specific term when a pop song builds on piece of classical music?

In the context of a pop song that incorporates or builds upon a piece of classical music, the term often used is "classical crossover." This genre blends elements of classical music with popular music styles. It's a more specific term than "adaptation" or "arrangement," as it specifically refers to the merging of classical music with popular music genres. This approach often involves taking well-known classical melodies and reinterpreting them with contemporary rhythms, instrumentation, and sometimes adding lyrics.
