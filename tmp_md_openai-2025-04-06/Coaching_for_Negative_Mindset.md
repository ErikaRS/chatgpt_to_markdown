do you have some concrete tips on how you coach someone into a more forward leaning stance? 

Context: one of my reports is a manager who approaches conversations where he disagrees from a very negative position, either "here's all the reasons we can't do that" or "here's all the disruption it will cause it you tell us we have to do that."

The problem isn't that he's wrong. He's a very smart person who is generally very correct in his concerns relative to the problem he thinks he is solving.

But he has a tendency to take a statement, make an assumption about what it means, and then talk about all of the problems. 

Concrete example: there's a project that I've asked him to scope and have been asking him to scope for several weeks. Today we got to the point where he said he would if I told him he had to and asked when I wanted it by. I said next week sometime.

His response was to spend several minutes telling me that if he is going to commit to this then it would likely distract the two person team working in that area for the whole week and be very disruptive. 

After I asked various questions about why it would be so disruptive, we finally got to the point where he said that he was assuming that my date was a hard commitment, not a target date.

That example illustrates the pattern I've seen: someone (not always me) says something, he talks about all of the problems it will cause, and eventually it comes out that he was making an assumption which may or may not have been unreasonable but which could have been clarified much more quickly if he'd asked questions instead of going into "no" mode.

I've tried asking him to ask more questions. I've tried asking him to talk less about what they can't do and more about constraints or trade-offs. So far, neither has helped.

What are other tools I might consider?

Addressing a mindset that defaults to negativity or a defensive stance requires a multifaceted approach. The individual, in this case, might be acting out of past experiences, insecurity, a fear of failure, or other deeply rooted reasons. Here's a structured approach you might consider:

1. **Build Trust and Openness**: Before any feedback or coaching can be effective, it's essential to ensure that there's a strong foundation of trust. This means showing genuine interest in their well-being, understanding their perspective, and assuring them that feedback is for their growth.

2. **Acknowledge Their Strengths**: Start by acknowledging their expertise and the value they bring. This can help reduce any potential defensiveness. "I really appreciate your depth of knowledge and your ability to foresee potential pitfalls."

3. **Use the SBI Model**:
   - **Situation**: Describe the specific situation where the behavior occurred.
   - **Behavior**: Describe the observed behavior without judgment.
   - **Impact**: Explain the effect of that behavior. 

   For instance, "In today's meeting when I proposed the project deadline, you immediately listed potential disruptions. This approach often makes it challenging to move forward and can slow down our decision-making process."

4. **Role Play**: Consider using role-playing as a tool. Simulate a scenario where he can practice asking clarifying questions rather than making assumptions. This can give him a safe space to practice a new behavior.

5. **Feedback Loop**: After meetings or discussions, take a few minutes to reflect on the conversation. Ask questions like, "How do you think that conversation went? What assumptions did we make? What could we have clarified earlier?"

6. **Encourage a Growth Mindset**: Introduce him to the concept of a growth mindset, where challenges are seen as opportunities to learn rather than threats. Recommend books or articles on the topic, such as Carol Dweck's "Mindset".

7. **Set Clear Expectations**: Clearly communicate what you expect in terms of communication. For example, "Before listing potential challenges, I'd appreciate if you could first seek clarification on any assumptions."

8. **Use the "Yes, and..." Technique**: Encourage the use of "Yes, and..." instead of "Yes, but...". This simple switch can help in building upon ideas rather than shutting them down.

9. **Seek External Training**: Consider enrolling him in communication or leadership training programs. These can provide tools and techniques for more effective communication.

10. **Encourage Self-awareness**: Encourage him to reflect on why he might be defaulting to this behavior. Is it fear of failure? Past experiences where assumptions caused problems? Self-awareness is the first step to change.

11. **Reinforce Positive Behavior**: When he does ask questions or avoids making immediate assumptions, acknowledge and praise that behavior.

12. **Consistent Feedback**: Regularly provide feedback, both positive and constructive. This helps in reinforcing desired behaviors and rectifying undesired ones.

13. **Consider a Mentor or Coach**: A third-party perspective, especially from someone who's been in a similar position, can be invaluable. They can provide insights, strategies, and feedback from a neutral standpoint.

Lastly, patience is crucial. Behavioral changes don't happen overnight. Continuous support, understanding, and feedback can help in facilitating this shift.

This is all great advice. Another thought I'm contemplating is: this is a director at a software engineering company. Given his level and role, is it reasonable that I think I should not have to coach him on these things and that's he's not meeting expectations if he needs this coaching? He's a current employee, so I'll try, but I feel like this will be reason to give a "partially meets expectations" score in our next review cycle. Thoughts?

It's a valid concern. At the director level in a software engineering company, one would generally expect a certain level of communication proficiency and an ability to navigate challenging conversations without defaulting to a negative stance. Here are some considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Role Expectations**: At the director level, the ability to communicate effectively, lead teams, and collaborate across departments is as crucial as technical expertise. If he's falling short in these areas, it's reasonable to have concerns about his fit for the role.

2. **Past Performance Reviews**: Reflect on his past performance reviews. Has this been a consistent issue, or is it a recent development? If it's the latter, consider if there are any external factors contributing to this change in behavior.

3. **Feedback is Essential**: Regardless of his level, feedback is crucial for growth. If you decide that his behavior warrants a "partially meets expectations" score, ensure that you provide specific examples and clear feedback on areas of improvement. This is not just about pointing out shortcomings but about setting clear expectations for future performance.

4. **Consider the Impact on the Team**: If a director consistently approaches problems from a negative standpoint, it can affect team morale, productivity, and the overall work environment. Consider the broader impact of his behavior on his team and the company.

5. **Opportunity for Growth**: While it might be concerning that a director requires coaching in these areas, everyone has areas for growth. If he's open to feedback and shows a willingness to change, it could be an opportunity for professional development. However, if he's resistant or doesn't show improvement over time, it might be a sign that he's not a good fit for the role.

6. **Seek Feedback from Peers and Subordinates**: To get a holistic view, consider seeking feedback from his peers, subordinates, and other stakeholders. This can provide additional insights into the extent of the issue and its impact.

7. **Re-evaluate the Hiring and Promotion Process**: If concerns about his fit for the role arise, it might be worth reflecting on the hiring or promotion process. Were there any red flags or areas of concern during the interview or evaluation process? Understanding this can help in refining the process for future hires or promotions.

In summary, while everyone, regardless of their level, has areas for growth, certain foundational skills are expected at the director level. If these are lacking, it's essential to address the issue, provide feedback, and set clear expectations. If there's no improvement over time, it might be worth reconsidering his fit for the role.
