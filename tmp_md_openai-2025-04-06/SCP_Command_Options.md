What is the scp -l option

The `scp` command is a utility provided by Unix-based systems like Linux and MacOS for securely copying files and directories between hosts on a network. It uses SSH (Secure Shell) for data transfer and provides the same authentication and security as SSH.

However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the `-l` option is not a recognized option for the `scp` command. 

The most common `scp` command options are:

- `-p`: Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.
- `-r`: Recursively copy entire directories.
- `-q`: Enables quiet mode, which suppresses the progress meter and warning messages.
- `-v`: Enables verbose mode. This provides detailed debugging messages about its progress.

To get the most accurate information, I'd recommend checking the man page on your system by typing `man scp` in the terminal. It could be that there have been updates or changes to the `scp` utility after my training data.
