Incorporating Christopher Alexander's properties of wholeness, a garage portico design for the house in the image would involve careful consideration of scale, structure, and harmony with the existing architecture. The design should feature a gradual transition in scale to connect with the main structure, establishing a strong center that draws the eye. Boundaries would be defined yet integrated, possibly through the use of matching materials or complementary colors.

Alternating repetition might be expressed in the rhythm of support beams or in the pattern of the roofing material, contributing to the positive space that feels intentional and part of a cohesive whole. The portico would have a good shape that's simple yet distinct, with local symmetries that provide balance without rigid mirroring.

Interlock could be achieved by having the portico roof slightly overlap with the main house, creating a sense of depth and ambiguity. Contrast might be present in material finishes or lighting, while gradients could be incorporated in the transition of materials or landscaping leading up to the portico. Roughness would add texture and human touch, perhaps through natural wood or stone that shows craftsmanship.

Echoes of the home's existing design elements should be subtly repeated in the portico, honoring the integrity of the structure. The void under the portico would serve as a defined yet connected space, and simplicity and inner calm would guide the overall aesthetic, avoiding unnecessary embellishments. Finally, not-separateness would be emphasized by ensuring that the portico is seen as an integral part of the home rather than an add-on, perhaps by echoing architectural lines and materials that unify the two structures.

Creating a visual representation of a new garage portico design can certainly help in envisioning the final outcome. Let's create a conceptual image of the portico that wraps around the corner of the garage while embodying Christopher Alexander's design principles. This will include elements such as a scaling roof, integration with the existing building, and textural contrasts. I'll get started on that now.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Design a modern garage portico for the house in the image provided. The portico should wrap around the corner of the garage, incorporating levels of scale by gradually ascending in size towards the existing structure. It should establish strong centers with a visually striking feature like an elegant column, and define clear boundaries that blend with the home's facade. Introduce alternating repetition in the design elements, such as consistent spacing between beams. The space beneath the portico should be positive, inviting, and well-proportioned. The shape should be simple yet significant, incorporating local symmetries without being overly symmetrical. Introduce deep interlock and ambiguity by blending the new structure with the old, creating a seamless transition. Use contrast in materials or lighting to draw attention to the design, and implement gradients in the pathway leading to the portico. Add roughness with natural textures, and echo design elements from the house. Ensure there is a void space beneath the portico that feels like a part of the whole, maintain simplicity and inner calm in the design, and ensure the portico feels like an integral part of the house, thus achieving not-separateness.",

Here is the conceptual image of the garage portico designed with Alexander's principles in mind. It wraps around the corner of the garage, blending seamlessly with the existing architecture.
