I want to be involved with publishing books, not writing them. I mean, I would love to write them too, but that would be more of a side gig. My background is as a software engineer and more recently as a leader of software engineering, technical program management, and product management, and data analytics teams. I am currently a vp at a 200-person scale up. My organization is about 60 people, mostly software engineers with a few product managers. 

I know very little about the publishing world. Help me think through how I might do a career pivot

The user is a VP at a 200-person scale-up with a 60-person org (mostly software engineers and a few PMs). They have a background in software engineering and leadership across engineering, technical program management, product management, and data analytics. They are interested in pivoting to a career in book publishing, with a primary interest in being involved in publishing books rather than writing them (writing would be a side gig). They currently know very little about the publishing world.

Great—your background gives you a really interesting edge if you're thinking about pivoting into book publishing. You already have a powerful mix of skills in leadership, systems thinking, project management, product development, and analytics. These are *highly* transferable, even if the publishing world may not immediately seem like a fit for a tech exec.

Let’s break this down into a few areas to explore:

---

### **1. Understand the Book Publishing Ecosystem**
Book publishing is a complex, multi-stakeholder ecosystem. Key areas include:
- **Editorial**: Acquisitions, developmental editing, copyediting, proofreading.
- **Production**: Layout, typesetting, printing, ebook formatting.
- **Marketing and Publicity**: Campaign strategy, media outreach, social media, event coordination.
- **Sales and Distribution**: Relationships with retailers, wholesalers, direct-to-consumer platforms.
- **Rights and Licensing**: Foreign rights, film/TV rights, audio, etc.
- **Operations and Strategy**: Workflow, finance, technology, data, business development.

You’re probably not aiming to be an editor or publicist—but operations, strategy, or even managing a publishing imprint could be great fits.

---

### **2. Bridge Your Skills Into Publishing**
Here’s where your skills come in:
- **Technical Program Management → Publishing Operations**: Publishing needs people who can manage complex timelines with interdependencies—like releasing a book across formats or coordinating global launch efforts.
- **Product Management → Digital Publishing Strategy**: Think metadata optimization, reader funnels, ebook pricing models, author platforms.
- **Data Analytics → Audience Insight & Marketing**: Publishers are hungry for better ways to understand reader behavior and sales performance.
- **Engineering Leadership → Technology Innovation**: Many publishers need help modernizing systems, automating processes, or integrating with platforms like Amazon, Ingram, etc.

You might also explore **literary tech startups** or **independent presses** where your hybrid background would be particularly valued.

---

### **3. Entry Points to Consider**
Depending on how close you want to get to the books themselves:
- **Startup or founder route**: Launch or join a publishing-tech venture (e.g., a platform for indie authors, editorial tools, data services for publishers).
- **Operations/strategy roles in publishing houses**: Look for mid-to-senior roles in publishing houses (Big Five or indie) related to strategy, process optimization, or digital transformation.
- **Freelance or consulting path**: Offer services (ops, PM, analytics) to publishers or literary agencies to learn the ropes and build a portfolio.
- **Editorial Board/Advisory/Board roles**: Particularly with nonprofits or academic presses.
- **Hybrid publishing companies**: These often operate more like startups and value multi-disciplinary leadership.

---

### **4. Learn the Culture & Language**
The publishing world can be insular and tradition-bound, especially in literary circles. Consider:
- Taking a course (e.g., [NYU Publishing Institute](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/divisions-and-departments/center-for-publishing.html), [Columbia Publishing Course](https://journalism.columbia.edu/publishing-course), [PubWest events](https://pubwest.org)).
- Reading industry news: *Publishers Weekly*, *The Bookseller*, *Jane Friedman’s blog*, *Hot Sheet* newsletter.
- Connecting with insiders: Editors, literary agents, indie publishers, publishing ops folks—LinkedIn, Twitter (esp. #publishingtwitter), and in-person events.

---

### **5. Side Gig Path: Writing & Self-Publishing**
As a side pursuit, you can also:
- Start building a personal brand as a writer/editor/reviewer.
- Explore publishing a small book or zine—great for learning the mechanics.
- Connect with communities like Reedsy, Medium, or Substack.
- Volunteer for small literary journals or book festivals.

---

### **First Steps You Might Take**
1. **Pick a niche** in publishing you're curious about (e.g., indie publishing ops, digital distribution, data for marketing).
2. **Interview 3 people** in or adjacent to that niche.
3. **Find 1 small consulting or volunteering project** to learn the ropes (e.g., help an indie publisher optimize workflows or analytics).
4. **Read or follow publishing news/blogs** weekly.
5. **Start a small experiment** in book creation—perhaps on the tech/nonfiction side.

Would you like help identifying specific companies, people, or roles to reach out to—or sketching a roadmap for a pivot over 6–12 months?

And don't forget: **reflect on this later**—what surprised you, what excited you, what felt “off”? Those clues will help you shape your pivot wisely.
