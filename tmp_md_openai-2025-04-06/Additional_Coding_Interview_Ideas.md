We have an interview process that current has one coding interview and one system design interview. Descriptions of these interviews are included below. We want to add a second coding interview to get more signal on coding skills, but we want it to feel different from the existing one. Suggest some alternatives for a coding centric exercise that feels distinct from the current pairing exercise

### Pairing Exercise

- **Interviewers:** 1-2 engineers on the team they are interviewing for
    - Candidates for the same position should pair on the same exercise with the same interviewers.
    - Engineers must do a dry run with the hiring manager or someone experienced with this interview before their first pairing exercise.
- **Length:** 45 minutes
- **Details:** The candidate pairs with an engineer on the team they are applying to. The candidate should be prepared to lead the pairing in the editor and language of their choice. The interviewer will choose an exercise that is:
    - easy to explain
    - language agnostic
    - requires no special knowledge
    - be expanded in multiple ways if there’s additional time (add features, tests, etc.)
    - can be solved within the allotted time, leaving time for introductions and candidate questions
    
    Additional notes
    
    - The interviewer should ask the candidate to stop coding when it’s time for Q&A. Finishing the exercise is not the goal. The goal is to get as much signal as possible.
    - The interviewer should work as a colleague, offering help if the candidate gets stuck.
    - Candidates are encouraged to look things up as they would when programming normally.
    - The candidate can use the language and tools they are most comfortable with.
    - The use of coding assistants is both encouraged and expected.
    - If there are two interviewers, one should be the observer and avoid getting involved in the exercise. They should be as invisible as possible outside of introductions and Q&A.
- **What to look for:**
    - Does the candidate provide clear explanations of their ideas and decisions?
    - Does the candidate maintain frequent communication?
    - Does the candidate keep their partner informed while driving the coding process?
    - Is the candidate flexible in considering alternative ideas and approaches while changing code?
    - Does the candidate at breaking down the problem and collaboratively decide on an approach?
    - How does the candidate approaches troubleshooting - where do they get stuck, what avenues do they explore?
    - Does the candidate respond to feedback in a constructive and professional manner?
    - Did the candidate demonstrate the relevant domain specific skills?


### System Design

- **Interviewers:** 1-2 members of the team the candidate is interviewing for
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Details:** The candidate should be ready to design a system with conflicting or ambiguous requirements from scratch. The interviewer will choose a question appropriate for the target level. ask open-ended questions and work with the candidate collaboratively to design the system. The interviewer will ask clarifying questions to understand the decisions they make when designing system architectures. There is no specific candidate preparation required, but the candidate should be comfortable thinking through architecture in real-time, resolving ambiguities, and making trade-offs. Familiarity with system design principles and the ability to handle open-ended scenarios will be helpful. 

Additional notes:
    - The interviewer should stop digging when it’s time for Q&A. Finishing the exercise is not the goal. The goal is to get as much signal as possible.
    - The interviewer should work as a colleague, offering help if the candidate gets stuck.
    - The interviewer should choose the question to assess domain specific knowledge relevant to the role. The [backend systems architecture prompts](https://github.com/sourcegraph/interviews/blob/main/engineering/software-engineer/architecture/backend-systems/backend-systems.md) are a good starting point.
- **What to look for:**
    - How does the candidate identify and resolve ambiguity?
    - How do they make tradeoffs?
    - How do they communicate their proposal?
    - What is it like to work with them on a problem they haven’t seen before?
    - What is their intuition about solutions that are likely to yield good results?

The user is adding a second coding interview to their hiring process that includes one coding interview and one system design interview. They want the new coding interview to feel distinct from the existing pairing exercise.

To add a second coding interview that feels distinct from the current pairing exercise, here are a few suggestions:

### 1. **Take-Home Assignment Review**
   - **Format**: Candidates receive a take-home coding assignment that they complete on their own time (usually within a 48-72 hour window). In the interview, the candidate reviews their solution with one or two engineers.
   - **Details**: The candidate explains their approach, trade-offs, and reasoning. The focus is on the quality of their solution, their problem-solving process, and their ability to explain their choices.
   - **Distinct Feel**: This interview is less about real-time collaboration and more about reflecting on code quality, design decisions, and self-driven problem-solving.
   - **What to look for**:
     - How well does the candidate understand the overall solution?
     - What trade-offs were made, and why?
     - Can the candidate explain how they might extend, optimize, or refactor the code?

### 2. **Code Review Exercise**
   - **Format**: The candidate is given a sample codebase with deliberate issues (e.g., bugs, inefficiencies, unclear naming, or bad structure). During the interview, they review the code and provide feedback.
   - **Details**: This is done as a discussion where the candidate identifies issues and makes suggestions for improvements.
   - **Distinct Feel**: The emphasis is on critical thinking, familiarity with best practices, and communicating feedback clearly, which is different from collaborative coding.
   - **What to look for**:
     - Does the candidate identify and prioritize key issues effectively?
     - How do they communicate constructive feedback?
     - Can they suggest reasonable solutions?

### 3. **Debugging Session**
   - **Format**: The candidate is given a partially broken codebase and is tasked with finding and fixing bugs.
   - **Details**: They work independently while explaining their debugging process to the interviewer. The goal is to fix as many bugs as possible in the allotted time.
   - **Distinct Feel**: This interview emphasizes troubleshooting skills, analytical thinking, and understanding existing code, which differs from the generative nature of the pairing exercise.
   - **What to look for**:
     - How effectively does the candidate navigate unfamiliar code?
     - What debugging strategies do they use?
     - How well do they communicate their process and reasoning?

### 4. **Algorithmic Problem Solving (Solo Coding)**
   - **Format**: The candidate solves an algorithmic problem independently without a pairing partner. The focus is more on logic, efficiency, and demonstrating clear, independent thinking.
   - **Details**: Unlike the pairing exercise, this session is about giving the candidate time to think through an algorithmic challenge without an interviewer as a partner but with room for questions and clarifications.
   - **Distinct Feel**: This setting is more introspective, relying on the candidate’s own thought process and approach, providing a different dynamic from the collaborative pairing.
   - **What to look for**:
     - Does the candidate have a structured approach to problem-solving?
     - Can they optimize their solution?
     - How do they handle stress when working alone?

### 5. **Refactoring Exercise**
   - **Format**: The candidate is provided with a piece of working but poorly written code. The task is to refactor the code to improve readability, performance, or maintainability.
   - **Details**: The interviewer may give suggestions or constraints to guide the refactoring process.
   - **Distinct Feel**: This interview is focused on clean code principles, maintainability, and improving existing work, contrasting with the generative approach of the pairing exercise.
   - **What to look for**:
     - How well does the candidate improve the code’s readability and structure?
     - Do they consider performance improvements or best practices?
     - Can they explain why their changes add value?

These options introduce different skills—like code review, debugging, independent algorithmic thinking, and refactoring—that contrast with the existing pairing exercise's collaborative problem-solving focus. 

Which of these options aligns best with the signal you're trying to gather?
