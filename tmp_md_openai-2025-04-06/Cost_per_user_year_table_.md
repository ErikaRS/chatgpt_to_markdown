Create a table which shows how much it would cost per year for a product with a $12 per user per month price, $16, and $20. Do this for 110, 120, 170 users

Here is a table that calculates the annual cost for a product at different monthly prices per user and for varying user counts:

| Number of Users | $12/user/month | $16/user/month | $20/user/month |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 110             | $15,840        | $21,120        | $26,400        |
| 120             | $17,280        | $23,040        | $28,800        |
| 170             | $24,480        | $32,640        | $40,800        |

To calculate these, I multiplied the monthly cost per user by the number of users and then by 12 (months in a year). For example, for 110 users at $12 per user per month, the calculation is \(110 \times 12 \times 12 = \$15,840\) per year.

At what number of users does the 16 per user price point cost more than the 110 user $20 price point?

To find at what number of users the $16 per user per month price point costs more than the 110 user $20 price point, we need to compare the costs:

\[ 110 \text{ users} \times \$20 \text{ per user per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = \$26,400 \]

We set up the equation for the $16 per user per month price point to exceed $26,400 annually:

\[ n \times \$16 \text{ per user per month} \times 12 \text{ months} > \$26,400 \]

\[ 192 \times n > 26,400 \]

\[ n > \frac{26,400}{192} \]

\[ n > 137.5 \]

Therefore, at 138 users or more, the $16 per user price point starts costing more than the 110 user $20 price point annually.
