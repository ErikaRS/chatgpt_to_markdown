There are several ways to access a GPU for small personal deep learning projects. Here are some popular options:

1. Local GPU: If you have a powerful GPU in your local machine, you can use it for your deep learning projects. NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support are popular choices for deep learning applications.

2. Google Colab: Google Colab provides free access to a GPU (usually a Tesla K80 or Tesla T4) for up to 12 hours at a time. You can use it to run Jupyter notebooks with GPU support. Note that resources may be limited, and you may need to save your work often to avoid losing progress.

3. Kaggle Kernels: Kaggle provides free GPU access through their Kernels feature. You can use their cloud-based Jupyter notebooks with a GPU for up to 9 hours at a time. Similar to Google Colab, you'll need to save your work often.

4. GPU-based cloud services: Major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud offer GPU instances on a pay-as-you-go basis. These services typically come with pre-configured environments for deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Keep in mind that these services can be expensive if used extensively, but they often have free trial credits or discounted plans for students and researchers.

5. Paperspace, FloydHub, and other platforms: Some platforms like Paperspace and FloydHub offer cloud-based GPUs specifically designed for deep learning projects. They provide pre-configured environments and pricing options tailored to different needs.

Remember that free services often come with limitations in terms of available resources and usage time. If you find yourself frequently exceeding these limitations, it might be more cost-effective to invest in your own GPU or use a paid cloud service.
