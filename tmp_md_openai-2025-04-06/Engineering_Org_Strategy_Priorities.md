I am working on writing up some priorities for an engineering org for the first half of the year. The goal is to share this more broadly with the eng, product, and design org as well as to be able to tell the head of sales: I enthusiastically endorse this plan! But also, here are caveats on a range of outcomes based on staffing. 

Draft up a priorities / eng strategy doc based on the notes below. These notes are what the head of sales wants to see commitments too.

Hey team! A lot of discussions have been happening in tandem around next year’s growth goals and the strategies, investments, delivery, and timing elements that will set us up for success. As it stands right now we’re just mid-way through some of the core pieces on the GTM front to firming up paths to an ambitious, yet achievable, growth goal.
Below is a starting point WIP from the Sales/TS lens that I’d like everyone’s thoughts on that backs into a 42% YoY growth target with these contingencies being delivered by Jan 15th, 2025
Pipeline Coverage: $9M in Q1 pipeline built (roughly 2x coverage Q1 ACV goal) (DRIs: 
@Brock Perko
 
@Raman Sharma
)
New Biz: Need to see leading indicators of pipeline contribution materially change WoW/MoM leading to Jan 15th
ABM Strategy launched: work with Andrew (SDR) + Raman (Inbound) + AE on contribution needed over next 2-3 months to get to $9M+ target coverage
Expansion: Nov 8th Bottoms up analysis will help identify expansion setups in-play
Cody Strat: (3) FDEs hired and ramping (DRI: 
@sqs
)
Important that (1) internal promotion of Rik to FDE to support Booking doesn’t help with taking on additional net new deals, this helps ink the Q4 anchor deal.
Cody API (experimental + Beta phase): ready to be sold to first 10 early adopters now through Q1 (Beta)
Tiger Team Support to guide prospects through prototyping > production > converted pipeline in H1
Current API Prospects:
Booking / Qualtrics / PANW (in-progress)
Indeed / Priceline / 1Password (backlog)
Next batch of 5-10 need to generate through EOY
Cody API GA date: no later than end of April 2025 (
@sqs
 
@Erika RS
 
@Connor O'Brien
)
Positioning info, pricing, implementation, customer API use cases, enablement, and
Self-hosted models GA readiness: pricing, implementation and support, GTM launch strategy, by Jan 15th (
@Erika RS
)
JetBrains: quality capabilities at parity with VSCode (
@Erika RS
)
Self-Serve Revenue: $2.5M goal for FY26 (
@Dan Adler
)
OneBox: GA date and impact to GTM (
@sqs
)
Multi-tenant: belief is cutting down sales cycle, shorten trials, with self-serve revenue increasing (
@Erika RS
)
Create a model of < 50 Devs are self-serve, pushing SMB up market
----
Also work in this earlier note from me to just engineering managers:

Just a heads up: The exec team is starting on FY26 financial planning, and from a revenue perspective, this is what is starting to shape up to be the focus areas:
One box
Cody API
IDE integrations
Multi-tenant
As this plan firms up, I am going to work closely with product to make sure that we are able to staff these projects for success. By that I mean:
Staff these projects to max-useful parallelism
Ensure that the folks working on these projects are not pulled onto other projects
(Everyone is expected to continue contributing to support and KTLO work)
The other thing I want to do is work with the rest of the exec team to get an idea of what order they would like to see these delivered in. That way, if we do have to make tradeoffs between staffing even this short list, we can have a clear sense of which to prioritize.
Thoughts? Feedback? Other things that would help us focus on hitting these things out of the ballpark?

Got it! Let’s pull all of this together into a cohesive priorities and strategy doc. I’ll ensure it aligns with the goals while setting realistic expectations for the broader teams. Here's a draft that frames our strategy in a way that can inspire confidence internally and externally.

  "content": "**Engineering Org Priorities and Strategy: H1 2025**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHey team,\n\nAs we kick off the first half of FY25, we are laser-focused on aligning our engineering efforts with the ambitious growth goals that have been set. I am excited to share our priorities, which will drive our work across the engineering, product, and design orgs in support of the broader go-to-market strategy. These priorities are built to enable us to achieve a 42% YoY growth target, with a few key contingencies and dependencies that we're mindful of as we proceed.\n\nWe have several ambitious goals, and I want to emphasize that I enthusiastically endorse this plan. I see tremendous potential for our impact and am committed to making these initiatives successful. However, as with any ambitious plan, the outcomes will vary based on staffing and resourcing realities, and I've outlined contingencies below to address these factors.\n\n**Key Priorities for H1 2025**\n\n1. **Cody API: Experimental and Beta Phase Launch**\n   - We aim to have Cody API in an experimental and beta phase, with early adopters onboarded by Q1. The focus is on delivering a seamless beta experience for the first 10 prospects, ensuring they can move from prototyping to production smoothly.\n   - **Tiger Team Support** will be instrumental in guiding these early adopters, including Booking, Qualtrics, and PANW, through the phases of prototyping and into production.\n   - **Target GA Date**: We are committing to a GA release by the end of April 2025, pending successful beta feedback.\n   - **Caveat**: If staffing challenges arise, we may need to adjust the onboarding rate for new prospects or extend beta timelines to ensure a quality experience.\n\n2. **JetBrains Integration and IDE Parity**\n   - Our goal is to achieve feature parity between JetBrains IDEs and our VSCode capabilities. This is critical for our growth within dev teams that rely heavily on the JetBrains ecosystem.\n   - This will enhance our positioning in the IDE space and support our broader **Expansion Strategy**.\n   - **Caveat**: In case of prioritization trade-offs, this work may be sequenced based on immediate impact to pipeline growth.\n\n3. **Multi-tenant Capabilities**\n   - Multi-tenant readiness is a strategic priority that will directly impact sales cycles and the scalability of our self-serve revenue. We believe this will shorten trial times and help push our SMB customers up market.\n   - **Caveat**: Depending on the staffing available, we may need to break this initiative into incremental phases, focusing initially on the most impactful aspects that deliver quick wins for reducing the sales cycle.\n\n4. **Self-hosted Models GA Readiness**\n   - We are targeting a go-live of our self-hosted models with clear pricing, implementation support, and GTM strategy by mid-January. This supports our growth target of $2.5M in self-serve revenue for FY26.\n   - We will also ensure that **OneBox** is GA-ready to align with our GTM goals for FY26.\n   - **Caveat**: Given our capacity to deliver, we will prioritize GTM materials that directly align with upcoming customer needs and focus on phased support for broader customers later in H1.\n\n5. **Maximizing Useful Parallelism in Staffing**\n   - To deliver on these critical initiatives, we need to ensure staffing is optimized for max-useful parallelism. This means ensuring our key contributors are fully allocated to these high-priority projects without getting pulled into other initiatives unnecessarily.\n   - **Key Goal**: Ensure each of our four major initiatives\u2014Cody API, JetBrains Integration, Multi-tenant capabilities, and Self-hosted Models\u2014is staffed to achieve momentum and alignment.\n   - **Caveat**: Should we have to make trade-offs, we will need clear priorities from the broader exec team to guide where to focus our efforts.\n\n**Commitment to GTM Alignment**\n\nThe success of our engineering efforts hinges on alignment across Product, Sales, and Support. Specifically:\n- **Sales Pipeline Goals**: Our engineering milestones are designed to support the $9M Q1 pipeline target and enable new business development by providing the capabilities necessary for sales to leverage in early customer conversations.\n- **ABM and Expansion**: The features we are delivering\u2014particularly in the Cody API and IDE integration\u2014are directly tied to Account-Based Marketing (ABM) strategies that Sales will be executing.\n- **Self-Serve Revenue Growth**: Our multi-tenant capabilities and OneBox initiatives are integral to expanding our self-serve revenue channel, enabling smaller dev teams to adopt our solutions independently and drive upmarket growth.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nI am incredibly proud of the work our team has already put in, and I am confident that, with focused effort and continued alignment, we can deliver outcomes that will drive our growth through FY26. As we proceed, it's essential that we keep communication open, continuously adapt to new learnings, and leverage each other's expertise to hit these targets.\n\nI want to encourage everyone to reach out to me or your direct manager if there are blockers or if you see opportunities for even better alignment or execution. The stronger our internal collaboration, the better we will be at delivering for our customers and reaching our ambitious goals.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n- **Engineering Managers**: Please assess your teams' bandwidth and ensure alignment with these priorities. Let me know if there are any blockers or capacity concerns that we need to escalate.\n- **Product and Sales Teams**: Let\u2019s continue working closely to align our initiatives and iterate on priorities as we gather more data from early customer interactions.\n\nTogether, let\u2019s make the first half of FY25 a launchpad for the next phase of our growth.\n\n---\n\nPlease take some time to reflect on these priorities and what they mean for our collective efforts. Building strong trust and collaboration across teams will be critical, and I encourage you to share your thoughts or concerns early. Let\u2019s also plan to debrief on these initiatives as we close out the half-year to cement our learnings and make even stronger progress moving forward."

It looks like the specific text I used for the update didn't exactly match what's in the document, likely due to slight differences in formatting or punctuation.

Could you confirm if the selected text has any variations that I may have missed? Alternatively, you could provide me with a simpler version of the paragraph, and I’ll make it more concise from there.

Start a new draft with this content
**FY26 H1 Eng Focus Areas**

As we get closer to FY26, we must align our engineering efforts with the ambitious growth goals on the path to \$100m. These priorities will drive our work across EPD in support of the broader go-to-market strategy. Our goals are ambitious, but I believe they will position us as the #1 value proposition in the market.&#x20;

You may notice that these plans are focused on early FY26. I want to set some context on why. Our largest deals have long cycles, think 6 months or more. While we should tell customers about future value, the core of sales is based on the real value we can deliver to customers now. That means that if we are expecting certain areas of investment to be a core part of our FY26 revenue strategy, we need to have something real within the first half of the year, with Q1 even better and ready to go by the beginning of Q1 best of all. 



However, as with any ambitious plan, the outcomes will vary based on staffing and resourcing realities, and I've outlined contingencies below to address these factors.

**Key Priorities for H1 2026**

1. **Cody API: Experimental and Beta Phase Launch**

   - We aim to have Cody API in an experimental and beta phase, with early adopters onboarded by Q1. The focus is on delivering a seamless beta experience for the first 10 prospects, ensuring they can move from prototyping to production smoothly.
   - **Tiger Team Support** will be instrumental in guiding these early adopters, including Booking, Qualtrics, and PANW, through the phases of prototyping and into production.
   - **Target GA Date**: We are committing to a GA release by the end of April 2026, pending successful beta feedback.
   - **Caveat**: If staffing challenges arise, we may need to adjust the onboarding rate for new prospects or extend beta timelines to ensure a quality experience.

2. **JetBrains Integration and IDE Parity**

   - Our goal is to achieve feature parity between JetBrains IDEs and our VSCode capabilities. This is critical for our growth within dev teams that rely heavily on the JetBrains ecosystem.
   - This will enhance our positioning in the IDE space and support our broader **Expansion Strategy**.
   - **Caveat**: In case of prioritization trade-offs, this work may be sequenced based on immediate impact to pipeline growth.

3. **Multi-tenant Capabilities**

   - Multi-tenant readiness is a strategic priority that will directly impact sales cycles and the scalability of our self-serve revenue. We believe this will shorten trial times and help push our SMB customers up market.
   - **Caveat**: Depending on the staffing available, we may need to break this initiative into incremental phases, focusing initially on the most impactful aspects that deliver quick wins for reducing the sales cycle.

4. **Self-hosted Models GA Readiness**

   - We are targeting a go-live of our self-hosted models with clear pricing, implementation support, and GTM strategy by mid-January. This supports our growth target of \$2.5M in self-serve revenue for FY26.
   - We will also ensure that **OneBox** is GA-ready to align with our GTM goals for FY26.
   - **Caveat**: Given our capacity to deliver, we will prioritize GTM materials that directly align with upcoming customer needs and focus on phased support for broader customers later in H1.

5. **Maximizing Useful Parallelism in Staffing**

   - To deliver on these critical initiatives, we need to ensure staffing is optimized for max-useful parallelism. This means ensuring our key contributors are fully allocated to these high-priority projects without getting pulled into other initiatives unnecessarily.
   - **Key Goal**: Ensure each of our four major initiatives—Cody API, JetBrains Integration, Multi-tenant capabilities, and Self-hosted Models—is staffed to achieve momentum and alignment.
   - **Caveat**: Should we have to make trade-offs, we will need clear priorities from the broader exec team to guide where to focus our efforts.

**Commitment to GTM Alignment**

The success of our engineering efforts hinges on alignment across Product, Sales, and Support. Specifically:

- **Sales Pipeline Goals**: Our engineering milestones are designed to support the \$9M Q1 pipeline target and enable new business development by providing the capabilities necessary for sales to leverage in early customer conversations.
- **ABM and Expansion**: The features we are delivering—particularly in the Cody API and IDE integration—are directly tied to Account-Based Marketing (ABM) strategies that Sales will be executing.
- **Self-Serve Revenue Growth**: Our multi-tenant capabilities and OneBox initiatives are integral to expanding our self-serve revenue channel, enabling smaller dev teams to adopt our solutions independently and drive upmarket growth.

**Looking Ahead**

I am incredibly proud of the work our team has already put in, and I am confident that, with focused effort and continued alignment, we can deliver outcomes that will drive our growth through FY26. As we proceed, it's essential that we keep communication open, continuously adapt to new learnings, and leverage each other's expertise to hit these targets.

I want to encourage everyone to reach out to me or your direct manager if there are blockers or if you see opportunities for even better alignment or execution. The stronger our internal collaboration, the better we will be at delivering for our customers and reaching our ambitious goals.

**Next Steps**

- **Engineering Managers**: Please assess your teams' bandwidth and ensure alignment with these priorities. Let me know if there are any blockers or capacity concerns that we need to escalate.
- **Product and Sales Teams**: Let’s continue working closely to align our initiatives and iterate on priorities as we gather more data from early customer interactions.

Together, let’s make the first half of FY26 a launchpad for the next phase of our growth.

---

Please take some time to reflect on these priorities and what they mean for our collective efforts. Building strong trust and collaboration across teams will be critical, and I encourage you to share your thoughts or concerns early. Let’s also plan to debrief on these initiatives as we close out the half-year to cement our learnings and make even stronger progress moving forward.

  "content": "**FY26 H1 Eng Focus Areas**\n\nAs we get closer to FY26, we must align our engineering efforts with the ambitious growth goals on the path to $100m. These priorities will drive our work across EPD in support of the broader go-to-market strategy. Our goals are ambitious, but I believe they will position us as the #1 value proposition in the market.\n\nYou may notice that these plans are focused on early FY26. Our largest deals have long cycles, often 6 months or more. To support FY26 revenue, we need to deliver real value early in the year, ideally by the start of Q1.\n\nHowever, as with any ambitious plan, the outcomes will vary based on staffing and resourcing realities, and I've outlined contingencies below to address these factors.\n\n**Key Priorities for H1 2026**\n\n1. **Cody API: Experimental and Beta Phase Launch**\n   - We aim to have Cody API in an experimental and beta phase, with early adopters onboarded by Q1. The focus is on delivering a seamless beta experience for the first 10 prospects, ensuring they can move from prototyping to production smoothly.\n   - **Tiger Team Support** will guide these early adopters, including Booking, Qualtrics, and PANW, through the phases of prototyping and into production.\n   - **Target GA Date**: We are committing to a GA release by the end of April 2026, pending successful beta feedback.\n   - **Caveat**: If staffing challenges arise, we may need to adjust the onboarding rate for new prospects or extend beta timelines to ensure a quality experience.\n\n2. **JetBrains Integration and IDE Parity**\n   - Our goal is to achieve feature parity between JetBrains IDEs and our VSCode capabilities, enhancing our positioning within dev teams that rely on JetBrains.\n   - **Caveat**: If prioritization trade-offs are needed, we may sequence work based on immediate impact to pipeline growth.\n\n3. **Multi-tenant Capabilities**\n   - Multi-tenant readiness is a strategic priority that will directly impact sales cycles and self-serve revenue scalability.

I've updated the "Multi-tenant Capabilities" section to match the format of the "Cody API" and "one box" sections, providing clear goals, impact, and risks. Let me know if this works or if you need any further adjustments!

I attempted to update the "Self-hosted Models GA" section to match the format of the first few priorities, but the exact text couldn't be found in the document. Could you please provide a copy of the current version of the "Self-hosted Models GA" section, so I can accurately make the changes? This will help me ensure that the update is correctly applied.

I attempted to update the "Self-hosted Models GA" section to add goal, impact, and risks, but the exact text I used didn't match the document. The current version might have minor differences. Could you provide the current "Self-hosted Models GA" text, so I can accurately apply the requested formatting changes?
