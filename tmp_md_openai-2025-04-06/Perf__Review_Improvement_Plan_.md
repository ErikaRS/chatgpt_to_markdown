Their strengths include being able to understand issues, caring about good process, and creating solid plans. The not meeting expectations on performance is due primarily to volume of output. Their recent work has been meeting expectations, but overall for the cycle they were note.

Update the language to make it clear that we're engaging in formal coaching but not engaging in a performance improvement plan because recent work (after the end of the review cycle) has met expectations. Remove the bits about delegation and time management because those are not concerns in this case.
