PRFAQ stands for Press Release, Frequently Asked Questions. It's a document created during the product planning process at Amazon, which helps to articulate the product's vision and ensures that the team has a deep and shared understanding of the customer problems the product will solve. 

The title of a PRFAQ, similar to the headline of a press release, is one of the most important components of the document. A good PRFAQ title should have the following properties:

1. **Clear and Concise:** The title should be simple, easy to understand, and to the point. Avoid technical jargon unless absolutely necessary. Anyone who reads the title should have a general idea of what the product is and does.

2. **Customer-Centric:** A good PRFAQ title should reflect the customer's needs, desires, or problems that the product will address. This reinforces the customer-centric approach in product development.

3. **Unique and Specific:** The title should distinguish the product or feature from others in the market. This can be achieved by highlighting its unique selling points or distinctive features. 

4. **Action-Oriented:** Where possible, the title should communicate what the customer can do with the product or how they will benefit from it. 

5. **Engaging:** The title should be compelling enough to spark interest and curiosity. It's the first thing people will see, so it should make them want to know more about the product.

6. **Realistic:** Avoid hyperbole and over-promising. While the title should be compelling and engaging, it should also accurately reflect what the product does.

7. **Optimized for SEO:** If your PRFAQ document will be published online or if it will influence the creation of online content, consider using keywords that your target customers are likely to use when searching for products like yours. This can help improve visibility in search engine results.

8. **Future Oriented:** The title should also give a sense of the future, as it's intended to show a new direction or improvement. It should generate excitement about what's to come.

Remember, the title sets the tone for the entire PRFAQ, and it's the first thing that people see. Therefore, it's important to spend time refining it.

What are the properties of a good PR and FAQ when using this planning model?

### Assistant - 2023-06-21 15:38:00

Amazon's PRFAQ document consists of a press release (PR) and a set of frequently asked questions (FAQ). The idea behind this approach is to write the press release as if the product has already been released and then accompany it with a set of questions and answers that stakeholders might have.

**Press Release (PR):**

A good PR should have the following properties:

1. **Customer-centric**: The press release should start with the customer and work backward. The language should be non-technical and easily understandable by a layperson. 

2. **Solution-oriented**: Clearly articulate the problem that your product or feature is solving. This sets the context for why the product exists.

3. **Concise**: Avoid unnecessary jargon and buzzwords. Keep the text short and to the point, focusing on the most relevant details. 

4. **Clear Value Proposition**: Highlight the benefits that the product provides to the customers. This includes how it solves their problem or meets their needs.

5. **Catchy Headline**: A good press release headline should be intriguing and attention-grabbing, but it should also be honest and not overstate the product's capabilities.

6. **Authentic and Credible**: Avoid overly salesy language. Be truthful and realistic about the product's features and benefits.

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):**

A good FAQ should have the following properties:

1. **Thorough**: The FAQ section should cover all the potential questions that customers or stakeholders might have about the product, including its functionality, value proposition, and usage.

2. **Categorize**: Break down the FAQs into different categories such as product details, usage, and troubleshooting. This can help readers find the information they need more quickly.

3. **Clear and Concise**: The responses to the FAQs should be simple, straightforward, and easy to understand.

4. **Revisit and Update**: The FAQ should be a living document that is regularly updated based on feedback from stakeholders and customers.

5. **Address Concerns**: Any potential concerns or objections that customers may have should be addressed in the FAQ section.

6. **Incorporate Feedback**: The FAQ section should be a tool to gather feedback and learn more about what customers and stakeholders want to know, which can help inform future product decisions.

Both the PR and FAQ sections should focus on the customer, be written in plain language, and provide clear, concise information about the product or feature. When used properly, the PRFAQ document can be a powerful tool to align teams and stakeholders around the product vision and to drive customer-focused decision making.
