Plan a week of dinner menus that use the given ingredients.

Sure, here's a week-long dinner menu using your given ingredients. I'll assume you also have basic pantry staples such as salt, pepper, spices, cooking oils, flour, sugar, etc. For this example, let's assume the ingredients are chicken, salmon, bell peppers, spinach, onions, potatoes, tomatoes, cheese, pasta, and rice.

**Day 1: Grilled Chicken and Bell Pepper Skewers**

- Skewer chunks of chicken and bell pepper, and grill until cooked. Serve with a side of steamed rice and a simple green salad using spinach and chopped onions.

**Day 2: Creamy Spinach and Chicken Pasta**

- Sautee diced chicken and onions until cooked. Stir in spinach until wilted, then add cooked pasta and a splash of cream or milk, tossing until well combined. Top with a sprinkle of cheese and serve.

**Day 3: Baked Salmon with Tomato and Onion Salsa**

- Bake salmon fillets in the oven until cooked to your liking. While the salmon is cooking, dice tomatoes and onions and mix together with salt, pepper, and a splash of vinegar or lemon juice to make a salsa. Serve the salmon with the salsa on top, along with a side of mashed potatoes.

**Day 4: Stuffed Bell Peppers**

- Hollow out bell peppers and fill with a mixture of cooked rice, sauteed onions, spinach, and diced tomatoes. Top with cheese and bake until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

**Day 5: Spinach and Cheese Stuffed Chicken**

- Cut a pocket into chicken breasts and stuff with a mixture of wilted spinach and cheese. Bake until the chicken is cooked through. Serve with a side of roasted potatoes.

**Day 6: Salmon and Tomato Pasta**

- Sautee onions until translucent, then add diced tomatoes and cook until they break down into a sauce. Flake in cooked salmon and toss with cooked pasta. Serve with a sprinkle of cheese on top.

**Day 7: Chicken and Vegetable Fried Rice**

- Stir-fry diced chicken, bell peppers, onions, and leftover rice in a hot wok or skillet. Add in some soy sauce or other seasonings of your choice for flavor. You can also add a beaten egg and stir it in quickly to cook it and mix it through the rice for added protein.

Remember, these are just suggestions, and you can adjust the ingredients or recipes based on your dietary preferences or needs.

Of course, here are a couple of dinner menu suggestions that incorporate asparagus, fusilli noodles, ground beef, carrots, and eggs:

**Menu 1: Beef and Vegetable Stir-fry with Noodles**

**Main Dish: Beef and Vegetable Stir-fry**
- Cook ground beef in a pan until browned and crumbly, then remove from the pan and set aside.
- In the same pan, sauté chopped asparagus and carrots until tender. Add the cooked ground beef back into the pan.
- Season with your choice of sauces or spices such as soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, or a stir-fry seasoning mix.

**Side Dish: Egg-Fried Fusilli Noodles**
- Boil fusilli noodles as per package instructions until al dente, then drain and set aside.
- In a separate pan, scramble some eggs, then push them to one side of the pan.
- Add the cooked noodles to the other side of the pan and toss them around to fry them slightly. Mix the scrambled eggs in with the noodles and serve.

**Menu 2: Baked Fusilli with Ground Beef and Asparagus**

**Main Dish: Baked Fusilli with Ground Beef and Asparagus**
- Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Cook fusilli noodles as per package instructions until al dente, then drain and set aside.
- In a pan, cook the ground beef until browned and crumbly. Add chopped asparagus and carrots and continue to cook until the vegetables are tender.
- Mix the cooked noodles with the beef and vegetable mixture, then transfer to a baking dish.
- Beat a couple of eggs and pour over the noodle mixture.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the eggs are set and the top is slightly crispy.

**Side Dish: Carrot and Asparagus Salad**
- Peel and grate the carrots. Blanch the asparagus (i.e., cook it briefly in boiling water, then plunge it into ice water to stop the cooking process and preserve its vibrant color).
- Mix the grated carrots and blanched asparagus together in a bowl. Dress with a simple vinaigrette made from olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper.
  
These dinner menus provide different ways to enjoy these ingredients together. Again, feel free to adjust them to your dietary preferences or needs.
