"KiB" and "KB" are both units of digital information, but they represent different quantities:

1. **KiB (Kibibyte)**: 
   - **Size**: 1 KiB equals 1,024 bytes.
   - **Base**: It uses a binary measurement system, based on powers of 2.
   - **Usage**: Commonly used in computing and data processing to accurately reflect memory and storage capacities, as computer systems are typically based on binary systems.

2. **KB (Kilobyte)**: 
   - **Size**: The definition of KB can vary:
     - In the binary system (like KiB), 1 KB equals 1,024 bytes.
     - In the decimal system, which is more aligned with the metric system, 1 KB equals 1,000 bytes.
   - **Base**: The decimal-based definition (1,000 bytes) is more commonly used in general contexts, such as storage devices (like hard drives and USB flash drives), and when referring to data transfer rates.
   - **Usage**: The binary definition (1,024 bytes) is less common but still used in some computing contexts.

The distinction is important because it can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of storage capacities and data sizes. For instance, a 500 GB hard drive might actually have less than 500 billion bytes of usable space when measured in binary-based Gibibytes (GiB).
