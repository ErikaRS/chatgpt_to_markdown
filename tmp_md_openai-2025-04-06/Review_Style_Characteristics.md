This is a book review/summary I've written. What are some of the characteristics of it's style?

Social capital is the grease that keeps society moving, but over the past 30 years it has decreased. Bowling Alone is the influential book that gathered the data behind this trend and put social capital on the radar of the nation.

Social networks give rise to generalized reciprocity and trust. This is social capital. Reciprocity and trust are most useful when applied generally and not just those who have helped you in the past. Social capital allows society operate smoothly. People rely on social connections for friendships, romantic relationships, job referrals, and community and political organization. Social capital is correlated with individual happiness and with community goods such as lower crime rates.

For all the good that it causes, social capital is, like most tools, not unambiguously good. Gangs and the KKK are held together by social capital just as the PTA and Habitat volunteers are. Being gay in a close knit conservative Christian community can ruin lives. The rarely realized ideal is a society with large amounts of social capital and a large tolerance for difference, but the tensions between these tendencies are hard to reconcile.

Bowling Alone analyzes empirical data to show that social capital had been declining for 30 years (the book is copyright 2000, data from earlier). Putnam considers political participation, civic participation, religious participation, workplace connections, altruism, volunteering, and philanthropy, and perceptions of reciprocity, honesty, and trust. All measures have shown declines, from mild to dramatic. Some new trends seem to defy the decline (e.g., internet communities), but Putnam makes a compelling case that social capital is generally declining.

Consider volunteering as an example. In the US, we volunteer about twice as much as in other developed nations. Volunteering may be formal (through an organization such as United Way) or informal (house sitting for a neighbor). Over half of Americans volunteer when informal volunteering is counted. Volunteering is correlated with higher levels of philanthropic giving.

Education predicts volunteer activity; college graduates are twice as likely to volunteer. Parents volunteer the most because of their involvement with activities related to their children (e.g., school, sports teams). Community size, wealth, and family status are other predictors of volunteer activity. Americans who entertain at home are also more likely to volunteer than those who do not.

Community involvement is the most important predictor of volunteer activity. Data from 1996 shows that 73% of members of secular organizations and 55% of members of religious organizations volunteer. Only 19% of individuals not involved in organizations volunteer. Members of religious organizations tend to volunteer mostly for their church. Organizations provide volunteer opportunities for their members and act as recruitment pools.

Over the past 30 years, volunteer activity has not dropped across the board. Formal volunteering has decreased, but informal volunteering is more common. More people outside of organizations are volunteering, but they do not form long term relationships. There is a troubling generational decline with respect to volunteer activity. The "long civic generation", the generation before the Boomers, has volunteered more at every stage of life than the Boomers and Generation X is worse (although there have been indications that the Millenials may be reversing this slightly).

What is behind the declines in volunteering and other types of participation? Given the difficulty of analyzing social trends, Putnam's explanations are guesses. Up to 10% of the decline in these measures can be attributed to time and money pressures on families, up to another 10% can be explained by suburban sprawl and long commutes, and another 25% can be explained by electronic media, especially television. By far, the largest contributor generational succession. The Boomers and Generation X replace the long civic generation in numbers, but their percentage participation is comparatively abysmal. This may explain up to half of the decline in participation. Why this is occurring is an open question.

Overall, Bowling Alone was a fascinating and informative book. The quantitative information makes it a valid and credible resource. The publication of Bowling Alone prompted debate over the conclusions Putnam drew, but makes it clear that there are trends to consider, and whether they are considered good, bad, or neutral, they are worth examining.

This is a book review/summary I've written. What are some of the characteristics of it's style?

A couple months ago, I attended a seminar for GTD. At the seminar we each received a copy of the book. You can read better summaries of the GTD system than I feel like writing, so instead I will focus on the book itself and whether or not it is worth reading given the plethora of information online.

The first few chapters are an overview of the methodology, especially as it applies to mastering workflow and to project planning. The first two chapters, the general overview and the overview of the mastering working portion of the methodology cover most of what what in the seminar (the seminar also included some of the exercises from later chapters, but not the in depth discussion).

The sections on planning are something I have not seen very often in presentations of GTD. In contrast to the workflow management methodology, Allen's project planning methodology is very casual. He espouses what he calls the natural planning model. To plan a project you 1) define the purpose and principles, 2) envision outcomes, 3) brainstorm, 4) organize, and 5) identify next actions. There is no strict framework, and Allen actually recommends that you have as little supporting materials as are necessary to keep track of everything you need.

The other value of the book is the depth which it goes into. Although I am sure in depth presentations of GTD exist on the web, I have not run across them (not that I have really looked). The book gives in depth discussions of all of the parts of GTD. The most valuable, for me, was a description of how a full mind sweep would look.

Overall, I would say the book is a worthwhile read, even if you are familiar with GTD. I would especially recommend it if you are somewhat skeptical of GTD but are looking for some way to increase your organization. The book has a lot more of the wherefore and whys and a lot less of the fanaticism that often appears on the web.

Your book review/summary has a few distinctive stylistic characteristics that set it apart. Here are some of the key characteristics of its style:

1. **Personal and Informal**: The review has a conversational tone that makes it feel more like a personal reflection or discussion rather than a formal critique. This is evident in phrases such as "I feel like writing" and "I would say". You share personal experiences, like attending a seminar, which adds a personal touch and credibility to your review.

2. **Direct and Concise**: The review is succinct and to-the-point, focusing on the key elements of the book without going into unnecessary details. You provide clear, direct assessments of the book's content and its value.

3. **Practical and User-focused**: The review is focused on the practical implications of the book, rather than abstract themes or literary techniques. You consider how useful the book is to someone seeking to understand the GTD system, and you evaluate the book's value in a pragmatic manner.

4. **Comparative**: You frequently compare the book to other sources of information about the GTD system, such as seminars and online content. This gives readers a broader context and helps them assess whether they might find the book useful given the other resources available.

5. **Balanced**: You assess both the strengths and weaknesses of the book, providing a balanced review. You note where the book provides unique value, such as the in-depth discussions and the natural planning model, but you also acknowledge that much of the content can be found in other formats.

6. **Engaging**: The review has an engaging style, drawing the reader in with a friendly and approachable tone. You use phrases like "I would especially recommend it if..." to directly address the reader and provide personalized recommendations.

7. **Analytical**: You break down the content of the book into its key components and analyze each one. You also provide some analysis of the author's methodology and its implications.

8. **Honest and Authentic**: Your review feels genuine and unbiased. You're not afraid to admit when you haven't fully explored other resources, and you're honest about your initial skepticism towards GTD. This honesty makes your positive assessment of the book more credible.

This is a book review/summary I've written. What are some of the characteristics of it's style?

This was an excellent leadership book. Lencioni discusses the factors needed for team success. The principles seem like common sense but are easily neglected in the day to day activity of business. The principles are introduced as a fictional story of a dysfunctional team.

Often, the little anecdotes that are sprinkled into business books are annoying, so I want to look more closely at the difference here. The stories in a standard book are anecdata, hand selected scenes which illustrate a particular point. This can be done well, but often it's a shallow look at how if you apply this principle, poof! everything works as advertised. When used well, stories can illustrate a point, but they have to feel authentic. Authenticity doesn't necessarily mean true, but it can't be a perfectly packaged example of a miraculous change. The fable that makes up the bulk of this book is full of setbacks and there are no magical turnarounds.

The strength of this book is the memorable presentation which helps the ideas resonate. It's worth noting that the model itself seems to be based on just the author's experience. In my mental ranking of [(model + data) > just model > just data >> anecdote >> opinion] that still makes it pretty good, but it's not as well founded as, for example, the model of successful Google teams. Probably, if there wasn't a fairly clear mapping of Lencioni's model onto elements of that model, I would have been somewhat more critical of the lack of foundation.

It's worth noting the model itself, although I'm sure that summaries can be found all over the internet. The model expresses what teams need for success as a series of dysfunctions and symptoms. This helps counter the tendency to see the positive and say, "We get along fine. We get things done. Nothing needs to change." Lencioni uses a pyramid model; the lower level dysfunctions make the higher more likely and need to be fixed first.

The fundamental dysfunction is an absence of trust. The main symptom of this is team members projecting attitudes of invulnerability. They aren't willing to do or say things which may let others perceive them as less talented or capable than others.

Without trust, a team will experience a fear of conflict, which often shows up as an artificial sense of harmony. It's clear this harmony is artificial when there is little disagreement in the team even though people disagree in the privacy of their thoughts or with the people they do trust. This dysfunction is a natural consequence of a lack of trust, because disagreement requires making yourself open to being wrong, a type of invulnerability.

Without active discussion of disagreement, members of a team won't commit to decisions; the decision will always be someone else's responsibility. This is signaled by a sense of ambiguity where people wonder what they've really decided on and committed to. Even though it may seem like people can commit without having first had conflict, the conflict is necessary for two reasons. First, without voicing disagreements, better ideas may not be considered and flaws in the idea under discussion not worked out. Voicing disagreement also helps people commit because it allows them to understand why their preferred outcome was not chosen. They may not agree with the reasoning, but at least they understand that there was a thoughtful process which led to the outcome. The phrase "Disagree and commit" is often used to express this concisely.

When there's a lack of commitment, then people avoid holding each other and themselves accountable for the decisions that were made, resulting in low standards when those goals are not met. It's hard to hold others or yourself accountable to decisions that they did not really commit to in the first place, especially when there was ambiguity on what the commitment was.

In a business setting, perhaps none of this would matter if the team were still getting results, but this lack of accountability and commitment feed directly into the fifth dysfunction: inattention to results. The symptoms of this one are people taking actions which advance their status or stroke their ego instead of working to achieve the group's goals. Achieving ambitious goals requires full commitment and everyone working toward the same end, but if teams aren't holding each other accountable and if the members are not committed to the goals they've set as the best way to advance the good of the organization, then people will fall back to optimizing for what they think is best, whether that is pursuing an idea that they think is better which may undermine the broader goals or explicitly focusing on their own advancement because they think that the whole effort is going to fail anyway.

Lencioni's presentation of these ideas is much more memorable than mine, so just go read the book. It's a quick read -- it probably won't take you much longer to read than my summary :-P

This is a book review/summary I've written. What are some of the characteristics of it's style?

I consider The Origin of Wealth by Eric D. Beinhocker to be the most important book I've read this year. It brings together insights from psychology, network theory, complexity studies and more into a incomplete-but-illuminating view of how societies have created wealth over time. Wealth, in this case, is about so much more than financial value. It's the sum total of non-relational things that humans find valuable.

The perspective of complexity economics shows the shallowness of our common political divides. While it doesn't provide answers, it does show that the questions are much more nuanced than either the Left or the Right thinks about them.

This book is about so much more than economics, in the narrow academic sense. It's about humanity and how we achieve things in groups.

This book starts with a critique of traditional economics. The primary problem with traditional economics is that it makes unrealistic assumptions about human behavior and system dynamics. Traditional economics assumes that economic agents are perfectly rational actors with perfect knowledge. It also assumes that economies are stable systems that only temporarily leave equilibrium in the face of external factors. Even with these limiting assumptions, traditional economics has been able to introduce many powerful ideas into reasoning about the economy. However, these assumptions are wrong in ways that make many of the economic "laws" that are used to guide real policy fundamentally flawed.

A more realistic set of assumptions completely changes the nature of economic systems.

They are dynamic. They are constantly changing in response to internal factors, not stable systems responding to external inputs.

They are made of individual agents with incomplete information. These agents are rational, but they are inductively rational. They identify patterns based on of past experience and update those patterns as they acquire new information.

The actions of agents are constrained by network structure. Agents are limited in who they can interact with and information takes time to propagate across the whole network.

The system evolves over time. Both what success looks like and the best strategies for achieving success change as the agents interact in the system. These interactions give rise to macroeconomic phenomena, such as boom and bust cycles.

In dynamic systems, such as economies, best ways to optimize is to apply an evolutionary algorithm. This should not be taken as saying that the economy has exact analogues for biological evolution. Rather, that it follows a generic evolutionary algorithm where strategies that best fulfill a fitness function are amplified and modified over time while less fit strategies decline.

Over time, physical technologies, social technologies, and business plans propagate or decline based on their fitness for creating value for people. The fitness function is based both on physical constraints (good building materials must actually hold things up) and on human values. This constantly evolving system leads to the growth of wealth.

There is so much more to the book than this. For example, despite the focus being economics, I consider this book one of the best leadership books I've read this year. The complexity view of economics realizes that we cannot understand the economy without understanding human interactions in general. In the end, that's what makes this such a powerful book.

Next I will input some raw notes for a book summary for *Team Topologies*. Structure these into a review in my style. Remove redundancies. Keep the wording of the notes and add just enough structure to make it a summary in the style of my normal reviews. Try to keep the total length comparable to the examples. If anything is missing add a (NOTE IN ALL CAPS AND PARENTHESES) calling out what is missing.

- Conway's law is inevitable so let's embrace and design our team structure around the value we want to build. 
- Teams are the fundamental unit of delivery, not individuals and not larger organizations. 
- Fundamental team topologies include stream-aligned teams (the core unit of value delivery), platform teams, complicated subsystem teams, and enabling teams.
- Collaboration is good but too much collaboration can indicate that an organization is not well structured.
- There are different interaction modes between teams: a close collaborative relationship, X-as-a-Service, and facilitating. 
- Team structure is not static. It will change over time and organizations need to set up the right sensing capabilities to be able to make these changes as necessary. 

- Since you're going to ship your org chart, pull a reverse Conway maneuver and structure the org to match what you want to ship.
- This will enable you to build teams that enable fast flow. 
- This can be done using four types of teams:
    - **Stream-aligned teams** focus on having everything they need to deliver value while minimizing communication across streams. 
    - **Complicated subsystem** and **platform teams** reduce the load for stream-aligned teams by supporting the those teams as internal customers. 
    - **Enabling teams** are service providers who helps stream-aligned teams become more effective.

- This book provides is a set of tools that organizations can use to design effective team structures. 
- These are not the only possible organizational structures, but they are patterns that can provide a foundation.
- Organizations will need to figure out what will work in their particular context.
- Discusses how this book came to be written and how to use it.
- Highlights some key principles in the book.
    - An organization is a sociotechnical system or ecosystem. It's made out of human interactions with each other and with technology.
    - Teams are more than just mere collections of individuals. 
    - Conway's law is a powerful force that we should explicitly address. 
    - Processes need to work at scale. 
- For all of these principles, they cite a list of authors who are very aligned with my general philosophy. I'm excited!

- Traditional or charts do not work well for dynamic, constantly adapting organizations. 
- Take advantage of Conway's law and design organizational structures that support delivering business value. 
- This involves acknowledging some of the underlying realities of technical work, including 
    - our systems have both technical and human components
    - teams have cognitive load limits
- Doing this well requires a team first approach that focuses on the creation of well-functioning teams rather than focusing on individuals or larger units.

- We should utilize the reality of Conway's law to design organizational structures that match the software architecture that we want. 
- The people involved in organizational design need to understand how to design a good software architecture. 
- A  Corollary of this is that not all communication between teams is good. 
- Applying Conway's law to our benefit requires looking at both the org and the communication structure. 
- Problematic communication patterns imply a mismatch between our technical architecture and our organizational design. 
- Problematic communication patterns include:
    - A large amount of communication between teams that seem like they should be independently 
    - A lack of communication between teams that should be communicating mor

- Teams are a more effective unit of work than individuals.
- Organizations should build their work structure around small, stable, long lived teams. 
- Team should have no more than 10 people.
- The number of teams another team works with should be limited.
- These limits come from the findings behind Dunbar's number. 
- Each team has a cognitive load it can handle. 
- Respecting a team's cognitive load will make it most effective. 
- By ensuring that teams own at most one complex or complicated system, organizations can focus teams on work that fits within the cognitive load. 

- There is no perfect topology for a team. 
- Team to apologies will evolve over time. 
- What they should look like will depend on the context of a specific organization and its needs. 
- Key factors to consider include the scale of the organization and the engineering maturity of the organization. 
- The chapter uses DevOps patterns to illustrate how different topologies make sense in different contexts.

- This chapter goes into the details of the four types of teams: stream aligned, complicated subsystem, enabling, and platform. 
- It describes when each team is appropriate, the expected behaviors of each type, and the relationship between team type. 
- The chapter also discusses how to convert common team structures to the four types of teams. 

- Explores how to split systems and organizations into team sized units by looking for fracture planes. 
- Fracture planes are divisions of a space that allow for increased flow and autonomy. 
- A monolith can be as obvious as a large coupled code base but monoliths can also hide within the database, the build process, the release process, a shared mental model, enforced standardization, or a monolithic open plan workspace. 
- Monoliths should be broken up along fracture planes. This is an iterative process. 
- The most important fracture plane is the business domain, taking a domain driven design approach. 
- Other fracture planes which may be relevant include regulatory compliance, the rate of change, team location (for teams that aren't remote first), risk tolerance, and performance isolation. 
- Technology can also be a fracture plane but should be applied with caution since it can lead to increased hand-offs and reduced flow. 
- Finally, there may be fracture planes specific to your organization. 
- The key question to ask when choosing any fracture plane is "Does the resulting structure support more autonomous teams with reduced cognitive load?" 

- Once teams are defined, the next thing to do is define the ways that the teams can interact.
- Interaction models help to reinforce the team boundaries.
-  When interactions aren't following the model that seems appropriate, it is a good clue that the team boundaries may be shifting and need to be reexamined. 
- Collaboration model
    - Occurs when two teams work closely together to discover new patterns, approaches, and limitations. 
    - Boundaries between the teams are blurred. 
    - Generally, this model should only apply for a short amount of time. 
- X-as-a-Service 
    - A long time stable model where one team consumes something provided as a service by another team. 
    - The rate of change on the boundary is slowed down.
    - This can be an advantage to help the consuming team deliver quickly — they aren't waiting on changes.
    - Service teams need to build easy to consume, well road-mapped services to increase velocity. 
- Facilitating
    - This is another shorter term relationship where the facilitating team helps another team learn or adopt new approaches. 
    - The facilitating team should not own what is being built. 
    - Their goal should be to make the facilitated team self sufficient. 
- One point from this chapter I particularly liked was the idea of Architects as people who define both the organizational and technical structure. An Architect actively monitor team interactions to see when structures need to be updated.

- To maintain effective team structures, team topologies need to evolve over time.
- The amount and type of collaboration between teams will vary over the life cycle of projects. This should be expected and intentionally managed. 
- There are triggers that organizations can look for that indicate the need for broader changes in team setup. 
- These include 
    - the software growing too large for one team to manage
    - delivery is becoming slower
    - underlying services provide a large and confusing variety of support and user experience
- To understand if change is needed, an organization needs to be able to sense whether or not things are working well.
- Organizational sensing requires close collaboration between the people developing systems, the people operating systems, and the people supporting them. 
- Those closer to the execution of the system are the eyes and ears that provide feedback to the development side of things.
- To be most effective in providing feedback, these different functions should be the same team or stream aligned.

"Team Topologies" by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais is a transformative read that reframes how we understand and design team structures for the efficient delivery of value. Grounded in the inescapable Conway's Law, the book encourages organizations to embrace this law and design their teams around the value they want to deliver, rather than fighting against it. The implication here is that teams, not individuals or larger organizations, become the fundamental unit of delivery.

The book introduces four fundamental team topologies: stream-aligned teams, platform teams, complicated subsystem teams, and enabling teams. These topologies provide a foundation for building teams that facilitate fast flow and reduce the load for stream-aligned teams, acting as internal customers. However, these are not one-size-fits-all structures, and the authors wisely caution that organizations will need to determine what works best in their specific context.

Critical to this discussion is the acknowledgement of the sociotechnical nature of organizations. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding our systems as comprising both technical and human components. This perspective acknowledges that teams are more than collections of individuals and have cognitive load limits. As such, organizations should structure their work around small, stable, long-lived teams, respecting their cognitive load for maximum effectiveness.

The book wisely recognizes that not all communication between teams is beneficial, and problematic communication patterns can indicate a mismatch between our technical architecture and our organizational design. This makes the case for applying Conway's law to our advantage, ensuring that our organizational structures match the software architecture we want to deliver.

A key strength of the book is its practical approach. The authors don't just present theoretical concepts, but they offer a set of tools for designing effective team structures. They discuss the process of splitting systems and organizations into team-sized units along "fracture planes" for increased flow and autonomy. They also define interaction modes between teams, including a close collaborative relationship, X-as-a-Service, and facilitating. These insights act as a guide for identifying when structures need to be updated.

However, it's crucial to note that team structures aren't static. They will, and should, evolve over time. Sensing capabilities are needed to identify when changes are necessary, and organizations must foster close collaboration between system developers, operators, and supporters to make this possible. 

"Team Topologies" is a compelling read that challenges traditional perspectives on team structures and promotes a more dynamic, value-focused approach. As a reader, I found the principles in this book aligning well with my general philosophy, making it a highly recommended read for anyone involved in organizational design and software architecture.

This is a book review/summary I've written. What are some of the characteristics of it's style?

"Team Topologies" is an excellent read. It reframes how we understand and design team structures for the efficient delivery of value. Grounded in the inescapable Conway's Law, the book encourages organizations to embrace this law and design their teams around the value they want to deliver, rather than fighting against it. The implication is that teams, not individuals or larger organizations, should be the fundamental unit of delivery.

The book introduces four fundamental team topologies: stream-aligned teams (the core unit of value delivery), platform teams, complicated subsystem teams, and enabling teams. These topologies provide a foundation for building teams that facilitate fast flow and reduce the load for stream-aligned teams. However, these are not one-size-fits-all structures. Organizations will need to determine what works best in their specific context.

Critical to this model is the acknowledgement is that organizations are sociotechnical structures. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding our systems as comprising both technical and human components. This perspective acknowledges that teams are more than collections of individuals and have cognitive load limits. As such, organizations should structure their work around small, stable, long-lived teams, respecting their cognitive load for maximum effectiveness.

The authors note the perhaps-surprising idea that not all communication between teams is beneficial. Problematic communication patterns can indicate a mismatch between our technical architecture and our organizational design. This makes the case for applying Conway's law to our advantage, ensuring that our organizational structures match the software architecture we want to deliver.
