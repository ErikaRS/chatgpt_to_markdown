Make this more clear and concise:
Hey! I want to make sure we're all on the same page about unified architecture and responsibility there. 

The motivating question: What role should the Infrastructure team play in creating a unified Cody Architecture?

What I'm hearing: 
- From Nelson: @sqs would like @Nelson Araujo to be the DRI who drives the initiative
- From Quinn: @sqs doesn't want to dictate either the solution or the team structure to eng but does want to make sure that infra is taking an active role in this and not just seeing themselves as internal consultants

What I'm thinking:
- DRI for unified architecture: 
--> Right now, I don't think we know enough to say which team should be primarily driving this initiative. In fact, I think it will be enough of a cross-team effort that there won't be a single team that owns it.
--> However, we do need to identify a DRI to make sure that the right conversations are happening, commitments to next steps are being made, and, perhaps most importantly, bring the right sort of technical depth and insight to drive a set of good decisions. 
--> I think various people could take on that role, and one of the things I had on my plate to do this week was connect 1:1 to see who of various potential candidates is willing and able to make a commitment to make this effort their top priority
- Infrastructure team's role:
--> Regardless of who the DRI is and which people are involved, this effort will only be successful if it is codesigned between Infrastructure, Cody Growth Eng, Cody Product Experience, and Code Search (including Product Platform). 
--> So that means I'll want to have at least one person from each of those teams be involved in an active working group to propose a design here and turn that into a concrete roadmap.
--> (As a side note: upstream of all of this is some product vision. @csells, @rob, and I are working on an agenda for some Wednesday Merge time to dig into that so we can go all in on eng details on Thursday)

I want to clarify our approach to developing a unified Cody Architecture and define the responsibilities involved.

Question: What role should the Infrastructure team have in establishing a unified Cody Architecture?

Feedback:
- Nelson suggests that @Nelson Araujo, directed by @sqs, should lead this initiative as the DRI (Directly Responsible Individual).
- Quinn highlights that while @sqs is not looking to prescribe solutions or team configurations, there's an expectation for the Infrastructure team to be proactively involved beyond merely advising.

My Perspective:
- **DRI for Unified Architecture**: Identifying a primary team for this initiative is challenging due to its cross-functional nature. Instead, appointing a DRI is crucial for facilitating essential discussions, ensuring progress, and bringing technical insight. I'm currently exploring potential candidates for this role through one-on-one conversations.
- **Infrastructure Team's Role**: Success depends on a collaborative design effort involving Infrastructure, Cody Growth Engineering, Cody Product Experience, and Code Search teams. I plan to form a working group with representatives from each team to devise a plan and roadmap. Additionally, we're aligning on product vision with @csells, @rob, and others to inform engineering discussions.
