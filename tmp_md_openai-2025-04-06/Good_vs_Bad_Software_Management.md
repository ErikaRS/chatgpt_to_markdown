Draft a piece about good vs bad software managment in a high agency, fast moving startup

### Assistant - 2024-10-05 12:52:42



### Assistant - 2024-10-05 12:52:42

Sure thing! Here’s a draft to kick things off:

### Assistant - 2024-10-05 12:52:42

{"name": "startup_mgmt", "type": "document", "content": "In a high-agency, fast-moving startup, the difference between good and bad software management often lies in how effectively you can harness the energy of motivated, self-directed individuals without weighing them down. It's a delicate balance of guidance, trust, and providing the right kind of structure.\n\n**Good software management** in this context feels almost invisible\u2014it\u2019s a supportive framework that amplifies each engineer\u2019s sense of ownership and purpose. It\u2019s about creating an environment where engineers understand not just what they are building, but why it matters. The \"why\" empowers them to make decisions autonomously, to move fast without waiting for approvals or hand-holding. Leaders in this scenario focus on clarifying priorities, articulating clear goals, and removing obstacles, whether they\u2019re technical roadblocks or bureaucratic processes. They encourage a culture where experimentation is celebrated, and failures are opportunities to learn, not a cause for blame. Trust is foundational: managers believe in their team\u2019s ability to deliver, and team members know they have the support they need when things get tough.\n\nIn contrast, **bad software management** turns that energy into chaos or stifles it altogether. Poor managers may confuse control with leadership, insisting on micromanaging implementation details rather than guiding direction and impact. They create bottlenecks by needing to approve every decision or by drowning engineers in shifting priorities and poorly defined work. The result is talented people who feel stuck\u2014either because they're endlessly waiting for answers or because they\u2019re overwhelmed by noise, unable to focus on what matters most. A lack of trust creates a vicious cycle: managers feel the need to control, engineers feel disempowered, and the autonomy that should be the lifeblood of a high-agency environment is smothered. Instead of a sense of purpose, there's a sense of fatigue\u2014a feeling that no matter how fast one runs, they're still somehow behind.\n\nThe best managers in a high-agency, fast-moving startup understand their role isn\u2019t to dictate every line of code or feature decision, but to provide clarity, context, and support\u2014to set the compass, clear the path, and let the team move quickly toward meaningful outcomes."}

Change the opening to be: Impactful Manager, Ineffective Manager: The High-Agency Playbook for Sourcegraph

At Sourcegraph, the pressure to innovate and deliver is real, but so is the need to build a culture of autonomy, high agency, and sustainable growth. An impactful manager doesn’t just lead a team to meet deadlines—they foster ownership, empower individuals to take initiative, and create a culture where engineers grow while solving complex problems. An ineffective manager, by contrast, either micromanages the team into dependence or leaves them directionless. The difference often comes down to understanding how to balance guidance with empowerment.

I've updated the opening to align with the requested focus on impactful versus ineffective management at Sourcegraph. Let me know if there are any other edits or refinements you'd like!

### User - 2024-10-05 12:53:21

Replace everything after the updated opening with: The Ineffective Manager: A Fixer or a Phantom
Ineffective managers tend to fall into one of two camps: the fixer or the phantom.

The fixer thinks their value lies in solving problems for the team. They step in at every roadblock, provide instructions, and often do the work themselves. While this might seem helpful in the short term, it strips engineers of their agency. Team members stop thinking for themselves because they know the fixer will eventually swoop in to “save the day.” Over time, the team becomes dependent, stifling the creativity and initiative Sourcegraph depends on to innovate.

The phantom is the opposite. They assume that autonomy means being completely hands-off. They provide little direction, rarely check in, and assume that high agency will naturally produce results. The team is left to navigate without a map. While this approach might work for very seasoned professionals, it often leads to misalignment, confusion, and a lack of accountability.

Both management styles undermine high agency: the fixer takes away autonomy, while the phantom leaves the team lost without direction.

Add this: The Impactful Manager: Coach, Not a Hero
The impactful manager understands their role isn’t to solve every problem, but to create the conditions where engineers are empowered to solve problems themselves. They act as a coach, guiding without taking over, stepping back without disappearing, and ensuring the team knows both the destination and how to get there.

Here’s how impactful managers at Sourcegraph build high-agency teams while avoiding the traps of over-control and under-support.

Add this: 1. They Prioritize and Push for Delivery
At Sourcegraph, there is always more work than time, and everything seems like it should’ve been done yesterday. An impactful manager knows that their team is great at starting work, but the real value comes from finishing it. In a fast-moving startup, it’s not enough to chase multiple tasks simultaneously—what matters is delivering finished work that brings value to customers, users, and the business.

A manager’s role is to make tough decisions about priorities and help the team focus on what will have the greatest impact. In this high-agency environment, engineers need to know not only what to work on but also when it needs to be delivered to make the most difference.

But prioritization isn’t just about telling the team what’s important; it’s about empowering them to understand the value of their work in the bigger picture. Impactful managers ensure their engineers are not stuck in an endless cycle of starting new tasks—they are just as good at finishing and delivering real value.

Techniques for this:

Backlog grooming sessions to consistently refine and prioritize tasks based on business value.
Timeboxing sprints and setting clear deliverable deadlines so that work cycles end in tangible outcomes.
Progress tracking and regular check-ins to ensure that the focus stays on completing high-priority tasks, not just starting new ones.
Ineffective managers either push the team in too many directions at once or allow them to get bogged down in less critical work, resulting in lots of motion but little delivery.

Add this: 
2. They Clarify the Vision but Trust the Team to Execute
Impactful managers avoid micromanagement by clearly defining objectives that align with Sourcegraph’s goals—especially the goal of making the world’s code more accessible. Every decision must be made with the customer’s needs in mind. At Sourcegraph, the customer is both the developer and the organization relying on powerful code search and navigation capabilities. A good manager ensures that every engineer understands how their work contributes to solving the customer’s pain points.

But once the goals are set, the manager steps back. Engineers need room to figure out the “how.” When they understand what needs to be done and why, they are empowered to choose the best methods for getting there, fostering ownership over the process and results.

Techniques for this:

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to give clarity on goals without dictating execution.
Decision-making frameworks like RACI to clarify responsibilities while maintaining individual autonomy.
Kickoff meetings where goals are outlined, and the execution plan is left to the team.
Ineffective managers, in contrast, either hover over every step (the fixer) or fail to provide clear direction, leaving the team unsure of their purpose (the phantom).

3. They Build Transparency and Accountability into the System
An impactful manager doesn’t need to micromanage because they’ve built a system where transparency and accountability happen naturally. Tools like Sourcegraph itself, along with Kanban boards and daily standups, make progress visible to everyone. This isn’t about oversight; it’s about creating a culture of transparency where engineers can see both individual and collective progress.

In this environment, feedback is constant and candid. Impactful managers foster a culture where successes and challenges are openly discussed. This ensures that individuals can course-correct without waiting for intervention and allows the team to stay aligned on the bigger picture.

Techniques for this:

Daily standups to highlight blockers and keep everyone updated on progress.
Kanban boards or similar visual tools to make work visible and shared.
Weekly retrospectives to formalize feedback loops and discuss what’s working and what needs to improve.
Ineffective managers, on the other hand, either control everything or let teams operate in silos. This leads to poor communication and diminished accountability.

4. They Balance Speed with Sustainability
Sourcegraph thrives on speed, but impactful managers know that speed without sustainability leads to burnout. While ineffective managers either push teams too hard or let chaos reign, impactful managers find a balance between moving fast and keeping their teams healthy.

Impactful managers prioritize high-impact, customer-centered tasks that deliver immediate value. But they also keep an eye on their team’s workload to prevent burnout. Regular retrospectives and process improvements help maintain high velocity without overwhelming the team.

Techniques for this:

Sprint planning sessions that prioritize high-impact tasks delivering immediate customer value.
Downtime weeks or flex time for less intense work after major releases.
Workload tracking and open discussions on capacity during retrospectives.
Ineffective managers, by contrast, either drive the team too hard or allow inefficiencies to slow progress, resulting in frustration and exhaustion.

5. They Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling
The most critical skill of an impactful manager is the ability to ask the right questions. When an engineer presents a problem, the ineffective manager either provides a solution (the fixer) or brushes it off (the phantom). The impactful manager, however, asks questions to help the engineer work through the issue themselves. “What do you think is the best approach?” “How will this impact the customer?” “What are the trade-offs?”

By asking instead of telling, the manager encourages engineers to take ownership of their decisions. This promotes high agency—the team becomes adept at solving problems independently, with the manager acting as a guide rather than a fixer.

Techniques for this:

One-on-one coaching sessions focused on problem-solving through dialogue.
Problem-solving frameworks like the 5 Whys or Socratic questioning to help engineers explore the root cause of issues.
Decision-making templates where team members outline their reasoning and approach before making significant choices.
This method helps engineers grow without being dependent on the manager, ensuring long-term success and autonomy.

6. They Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience
Impactful managers know that working at Sourcegraph can be a rollercoaster. To keep morale high and the team resilient, they celebrate every win, no matter how small. Whether it’s shipping a feature, fixing a bug, or hearing positive feedback from users, these celebrations reinforce progress and keep motivation strong.

But more importantly, impactful managers build resilience. They frame setbacks as learning opportunities rather than failures. By treating failure as feedback, they create a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement, where risks are embraced rather than avoided.

Techniques for this:

Demo days where teams present their work and celebrate progress, creating momentum.
Failure retrospectives that examine what went wrong, focusing on lessons learned rather than blame.
Public recognition for key milestones, reinforcing the culture of collective success.
Ineffective managers, in contrast, either overlook these successes or punish failure, leading to a culture where risk-taking is stifled, and the team becomes risk-averse.

Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation
At Sourcegraph, an impactful manager strikes the perfect balance between guiding and empowering their team. They prioritize work effectively, deliver real value to customers, create systems for transparency, and encourage engineers to take ownership of their work. They ask the right questions, celebrate successes, and build resilience against setbacks. In doing so, they transform a group of individuals into a high-performing team that delivers results and grows through the process.

Ineffective managers either take too much control or leave their team to figure things out on their own. They misunderstand that true high agency doesn’t mean letting go entirely but creating the right conditions for individuals to thrive with the right amount of support.

In the end, the impactful manager knows their job isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build heroes.

Apply diffs between the current version and this version: 
**Leading High-Performing Engineering Teams at Sourcegraph**

At Sourcegraph, there’s always more work than time, and it often feels like everything needed to be done yesterday. Impactful managers empower engineers to take ownership, prioritize effectively, and deliver real value. Ineffective managers either micromanage or disappear, leaving teams unfocused or overwhelmed. The difference? Knowing when to guide and when to give space.

### Ineffective Managers: Fixers vs. Phantoms

Ineffective managers fall into two categories: **fixers** or **phantoms**.

The **fixer** jumps in at every issue, giving step-by-step instructions and solving problems themselves. This undermines autonomy, leaving engineers dependent and stifling creativity.

The **phantom** assumes autonomy means hands-off management, offering little guidance. While the team may have freedom, they risk misalignment and wasted effort without clear direction.

Both approaches hinder high agency: fixers smother it, while phantoms neglect it.

### The Impactful Manager: Coach, Not Hero

Impactful managers act as **coaches**, creating the conditions for engineers to solve problems independently. They provide direction without taking over, guiding teams toward goals while trusting them to execute.

### 1. **Prioritize and Push for Delivery**

At Sourcegraph, starting work is easy—finishing it is what makes the difference. Impactful managers ensure the team prioritizes tasks that deliver the most value to customers and the business. They balance speed with the need to complete high-priority projects, keeping engineers focused on delivering results, not just staying busy.

Techniques for this:
- **Backlog grooming** to prioritize tasks by impact.
- **Timeboxing** sprints to focus on deliverables.
- **Regular check-ins** to ensure progress on top priorities.

Ineffective managers either allow the team to spread too thin or fail to prioritize, leading to activity without output.

### 2. **Clarify Vision, Trust Execution**

Impactful managers set clear goals aligned with Sourcegraph’s strategy of winning enterprises by delighting developers. They connect the team’s work to customer outcomes and trust engineers to figure out the *how*, giving them the autonomy to drive execution.

Techniques for this:
- **OKRs** to provide clarity without micromanaging.
- **Kickoff meetings** to define objectives and set expectations.
- **RACI frameworks** to assign responsibility while preserving autonomy.

Ineffective managers either micromanage or fail to provide direction, leaving the team without a clear sense of purpose.

### 3. **Balance Speed and Stability**

Speed is critical at Sourcegraph, but it must be paired with building solutions that have the right level of complexity. Impactful managers ensure engineers build solutions that meet today’s needs without over-engineering for tomorrow. Things move quickly in our space, and we’re better served by **simple, robust, and easy-to-modify** code than by overgeneralized systems. This doesn’t mean cutting corners, but it does mean solving today’s problems without overbuilding.

Once the right solution is in place, impactful managers ensure that speed remains sustainable. Fast delivery only works if it doesn’t accumulate technical debt that will slow the team down later. Engineers are expected to take ownership of their code’s quality—delivering quickly *and* ensuring the codebase remains scalable.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to **velocity investments**—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. This approach prevents technical debt from piling up. Additionally, impactful managers identify **code hotspots** that slow development, using cleanup projects to address them.

Techniques for this:
- **Sprint planning** that dedicates 25% of time to velocity improvements.
- **Tracking hotspots** in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.
- **Post-release downtime** for refactoring and reducing technical debt.

Ineffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term stability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt.

### 4. **Drive Business Needs with Cross-Functional Collaboration**

Impactful managers understand that engineering doesn’t exist in a bubble. They collaborate closely with product, design, TPM, technical success, and marketing to meet the broader needs of the business. Their job is to ensure the right stakeholders are involved at the right time and to balance competing demands in a way that maximizes impact across the company.

One of the biggest challenges an impactful manager faces is balancing **customer-specific work** with initiatives that benefit the broader user base. Customer requests can be high-agency, urgent, and critical for business success, but the long-term health of the product depends on features and improvements that serve a wider audience. Impactful managers work with stakeholders to find this balance, ensuring customer needs are met while advancing projects that align with Sourcegraph’s strategic goals.

Even when stakeholders from different parts of the company aren’t available, impactful managers advocate for their perspectives, making decisions that reflect the business as a whole. This helps ensure that engineering efforts are always aligned with larger priorities.

Techniques for this:
- **Cross-functional meetings** to ensure alignment with stakeholders.
- **Balancing discussions** to weigh customer-specific work against broader product goals.
- **Acting as an advocate** for stakeholders, ensuring decisions reflect the full company perspective.

Ineffective managers either prioritize short-term customer work to the detriment of the broader product or overlook customer needs, causing friction between teams.

### 5. **Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling**

Impactful managers build autonomy by asking the right questions rather than providing all the answers. When engineers face challenges, impactful managers guide them to think through solutions, helping them develop problem-solving skills and build confidence.

Techniques for this:
- **One-on-one coaching** to help engineers think critically.
- **Socratic questioning** to guide engineers to solutions.
- **Decision templates** to help engineers outline their thought process.

Ineffective managers either solve problems themselves or fail to address them, preventing engineers from growing their autonomy.

### 6. **Celebrate Wins and Build Resilience**

Impactful managers recognize that resilience is as important as speed. They celebrate wins, big or small, to keep morale high. They also frame failure as a learning opportunity, encouraging the team to experiment and grow from setbacks.

Techniques for this:
- **Demo days** to showcase achievements and celebrate progress.
- **Failure retrospectives** to learn from mistakes without assigning blame.
- **Public recognition** to reinforce team successes and build momentum.

Ineffective managers either ignore achievements or punish failure, creating a culture of fear rather than innovation.

### Conclusion: The Empowerment Equation

At Sourcegraph, impactful managers balance guidance with autonomy. They prioritize work effectively, maintain transparency, and empower engineers to take ownership of both results and the quality of the codebase. By collaborating across teams, balancing customer-specific needs with broader goals, celebrating wins, and learning from failures, they build high-agency, high-performing teams that can move fast and stay sustainable.

Ultimately, the role of an impactful manager isn’t to be the hero—it’s to build a team of heroes.

1. Emphasize the Developer-Centric Focus
Strengthen the "Clarify Vision, Trust Execution" section: The section about setting clear goals and trusting engineers to execute can be more explicit about the company’s mission to delight developers. Since "Dev love" is a core value, we could emphasize how impactful managers guide their teams by keeping the developer experience central to every decision.

Revision suggestion:

When discussing product alignment, add that "everything we do is for developers, our unsung heroes. Impactful managers ensure their teams always prioritize solutions that developers love, whether working on a small fix or a large initiative."
This would help reinforce that every engineering decision should center on how it impacts developers, which is core to Sourcegraph’s mission.

2. Highlight the Culture of High Agency
The "Cultivate High Agency by Asking, Not Telling" section is consistent with Sourcegraph’s high agency culture but could be made even stronger by connecting directly to the essay’s call for taking initiative without waiting for top-down directives.

Revision suggestion:

Highlight how impactful managers "foster an environment where engineers are expected to act fast, take ownership, and make decisions. The expectation is not to wait for explicit approval, but to act in the best interest of developers and the business."
This connects more explicitly with the Sourcegraph culture, where everyone is encouraged to drive progress through experimentation and fast iteration.

3. Reinforce the "Win Together" Mindset
In the "Drive Business Needs with Cross-Functional Collaboration" section, we could better emphasize how collaboration and teamwork are critical to Sourcegraph’s success. The idea of "win together" is already reflected, but we could tie this more explicitly to cross-functional collaboration and mutual accountability.

Revision suggestion:

Add a note that impactful managers "help foster a shared responsibility across teams, ensuring cross-functional alignment so the whole company succeeds. This collaboration allows us to make decisions with diverse inputs, ultimately benefiting developers and the business."
This helps frame the role of engineering managers as not just facilitators of collaboration but as advocates for mutual success.

4. Emphasize Iteration and Speed in "Balance Speed and Stability"
Sourcegraph’s culture of "moving fast and adapting swiftly" fits naturally into the "Balance Speed and Stability" section. However, we can make the expectation of fast iteration more explicit here.

Revision suggestion:

Adjust the language to reflect that "impactful managers embrace change and encourage their teams to iterate quickly, even as they maintain a balance with software quality. Fast delivery is crucial, but impactful managers know that speed must be paired with simplicity and sustainability to keep up with the pace of change in our space."
This revision would reflect Sourcegraph’s dynamic, fast-paced environment where iteration is key, while maintaining long-term product stability.

5. Ensure "Hands-On" Leadership Alignment
In the "Prioritize and Push for Delivery" section, the essay emphasizes a hands-on, results-oriented culture where no job is too big or small. This can be better reflected in how managers engage with projects directly.

Revision suggestion:

Add a line that "managers are expected to be hands-on, working alongside their teams when needed, whether by participating in coding or providing direct feedback. Results are what matter, and impactful managers know when to roll up their sleeves to ensure the team delivers value."
This would make the expectation clear that engineering managers aren’t just delegating—they’re also deeply involved in driving tangible results.

6. Alignment with Transparency
The "Foster Transparency and Accountability" section already fits well with the "Direct & Transparent" value, but this could be further reinforced by acknowledging how Sourcegraph embraces open communication and feedback.

Revision suggestion:

Highlight that "impactful managers promote transparency not only within their teams but across the entire organization. They ensure information flows openly, encouraging honest feedback and creating a culture where teams learn quickly from both successes and failures."
This ensures alignment with Sourcegraph’s emphasis on candid information sharing and transparent decision-making processes.

7. Strengthen Emphasis on "Results"
Throughout the summary, we can build on the Sourcegraph value of being results-oriented. Sourcegraph’s culture emphasizes delivering tangible, impactful work, which should be a thread across all sections.

Revision suggestion:

Introduce consistent language around results. For instance, in the "Prioritize and Push for Delivery" section, you could say, "managers keep their teams focused on delivering results that matter. Every project should drive impact, and every engineer should understand how their work moves the business and the developer experience forward."
This ties every task back to the overarching goal of measurable success, a key part of Sourcegraph’s culture.

Replace section 3 with the version below and move the points about transparency and accountability into section 2 on clarifying vision while trusting execution.

3. Balance Speed and Stability
Speed is critical at Sourcegraph, but it must be paired with building solutions that have the right level of complexity. Impactful managers ensure engineers build solutions that meet today’s needs without over-engineering for tomorrow. Things move quickly in our space, and we’re better served by simple, robust, and easy-to-modify code than by overgeneralized systems. This doesn’t mean cutting corners, but it does mean solving today’s problems without overbuilding.

Once the right solution is in place, impactful managers ensure that speed remains sustainable. Fast delivery only works if it doesn’t accumulate technical debt that will slow the team down later. Engineers are expected to take ownership of their code’s quality—delivering quickly and ensuring the codebase remains scalable.

A good rule of thumb is to allocate 25% of project time to velocity investments—testing, documentation, cleanup, and refactoring. This approach prevents technical debt from piling up. Additionally, impactful managers identify code hotspots that slow development, using cleanup projects to address them.

Techniques for this:

Sprint planning that dedicates 25% of time to velocity improvements.
Tracking hotspots in the codebase and addressing them with cleanup projects.
Post-release downtime for refactoring and reducing technical debt.
Ineffective managers prioritize short-term speed at the expense of long-term stability, creating bottlenecks and technical debt.
