The term often used for Technical Program Managers (TPMs) who take on responsibilities similar to those of Product Managers (PMs) is "Technical Product Manager." This role blends the technical expertise and program management skills of a TPM with the product vision and strategy responsibilities of a PM. 

Technical Product Managers typically:

1. Bridge the gap between engineering and product teams.
2. Focus on both the technical feasibility and the market viability of products.
3. Manage product development cycles, from concept to launch.
4. Engage with stakeholders to gather requirements and feedback.
5. Ensure that the technical aspects of the product align with business goals and customer needs.

This hybrid role is becoming more common in tech companies, particularly in environments where technical complexity and strategic product management are both critical to success.
