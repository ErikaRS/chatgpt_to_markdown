üëÅÔ∏èüö¢ Fixing Founder Mode 
TO DELETE: Contributors: Ade, Erika, Gordon, Ben, ‚Ä¶

Founder Mode is an idea du jour. At its worse, it is a vague but seductive inkblot invitation for leaders to indulge their fears about their reports: are they secretly "professional fakers" who have been covering up their failures by 'managing up' for years? In many ways William Shockley was the first to practice this kind of toxic Founder Mode, and that led to eight people leaving who would go on to seed most of silicon valley. There‚Äôs a version of ‚Äúfounder mode‚Äù that is robust, but it needs some refinement.

The seductive version of ‚Äúfounder mode‚Äù suggests that one can fix a systemic problem (you hired, failed to train and failed to build effective feedback mechanisms for these people) with sufficient amounts of heroism because founders (and people who think like founders) are just that magical. Unfortunately founder mode won't work recursively. When it's done by non-founders it just looks like micromanagement because it requires the Weberian charismatic authority of the founder to provide legitimacy.

Even if the founder(s) can do everything by themselves they eventually realize that they don't actually want to do everything themselves. What is that founder‚Äôs comparative advantage? If you want to scale an org beyond a single charismatic leader, then you need an organizational culture that can allow for multiple kinds of leaders that fit your company. Even ones without the founder's halo. 

At its best, Founder Mode can be a way to build a culture that cuts through the thermocline of truth. But the default interpretation seems to be to use it as a thin excuse for micromanagement by followers of the Great Man school of history. This framing also conveniently avoids taking responsibility for allowing companies to succumb to the ZIRP where CEOs don‚Äôt steer but merely maintain an orientation lock. It also lets founders avoid the blame for the corporate culture that has emerged in response to the behaviors that they rewarded and punished in the days before they converted the company to manager mode.

Paul Graham alludes to it in his final footnote but you also need mechanisms to avoid founder mode turning into founder syndrome and eventually you need the ability to hire or grow people who can outperform you. As Steve Jobs as pointed out, those people don't want to work for someone who practices seagull management or who blames the 'fakers' that they hired or the 'management mode' that they instituted.

As an alternative we propose a set of interventions in your systems.
These offer a way to turn founder mode into a set of techniques and cultural touchstones that can be recursively used by other players (either co-founders or non-founders) in a large organization. As a result you‚Äôll be able to surf the efficient frontier between Founder Mode and Manager Mode.

Go to the gemba. This can range from actual 'gemba walks' to building a culture where all leaders are expected to regularly have skip-level 1:1s. When this works it can build a culture where leaders dive deep when discussing issues and aren't satisfied with superficial overviews. In fact one of the more positive aspects of Brian Chesky's embrace of founder mode was imposing a system of reviews after several years of letting things drift.

We also recommend investing in psychological safety. That way if parts of your system are failing or become toxic then people can inform leadership without worrying that they'll be punished. Or: if you go on a Gemba Walk but everyone there is afraid they‚Äôll be shanked, they‚Äôll just hide and you won‚Äôt learn anything. The test is to ask "did the last person who gave me bad news regret it?" If you don't know or don't care then you, as a leader, have failed. As Michael Carey puts it "if you kill the messenger, you just get less mail."

Another valuable intervention is accepting that you can't be everywhere at all times especially as your organization scales: leaders who operate like the Eye of Sauron eventually discover that they've disempowered their people rather than creating new leaders. Consequently everything they're not currently watching fails. Instead you have to train and empower your people so that they initially match your capabilities and eventually exceed you. 

One of the signs of a good leader in this distributed leadership model is that they act as a floor not a ceiling for their people's skills and impact. That also involves understanding that when your people are better than you at a job then you have to give them both autonomy and a feedback mechanism to ensure they keep delivering what you need. This is why the best sports teams are run by people who know that they can't be on the pitch at the critical juncture but must find ways to decentralize command so that someone else can make good decisions about when to pass and when to shoot.

Even in the extreme case, this can still work wonderfully! Many wildly successful football (soccer) teams tried ‚Äútotal football‚Äù, where any player is good enough to swap into and lead from any position. The recent, great television show ‚ÄúTed Lasso‚Äù explains Total Football well in this clip. This approach almost always beats teams built around a single player. The arguably best football player ever, one with an entire subreddit dedicated to charts where he is a wild outlier, often speaks about building and focusing on the best team.

We recommend escaping the false dichotomy between founder mode and manager mode. (frankly, we recommend escaping every false dichotomy). Instead, accept that even Steve Jobs said "we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do" and your role as a leader is to build systems that get the best out of your people.

"Fixing Founder Mode" critiques the problematic aspects of "Founder Mode" leadership, where leaders indulge fears of their reports being "fakers" rather than addressing systemic issues like poor training and feedback. The piece highlights the toxic potential of this mindset, drawing a parallel to William Shockley, who drove away talent that later founded Silicon Valley.

The seductive aspect of Founder Mode falsely suggests that heroic effort can solve systemic problems, but without the founder‚Äôs charismatic authority, it appears as micromanagement. Leaders, even founders, eventually realize they cannot handle everything themselves and need to build a scalable organizational culture that doesn't rely on their personal halo effect.

At its best, Founder Mode can cut through organizational denial (referred to as the ‚Äúthermocline of truth‚Äù), but it often devolves into an excuse for micromanagement. Effective leadership requires acknowledging responsibility for company culture and avoiding a founder syndrome trap, where founders can‚Äôt grow or hire people better than themselves.

The piece offers strategies to improve upon Founder Mode, including:

- **Gemba walks**: Promoting deeper engagement between leaders and teams.
- **Psychological safety**: Encouraging open communication without fear of punishment.
- **Empowering teams**: Leaders must train others to eventually exceed their capabilities, decentralizing decision-making for better results.

It advocates for blending Founder and Manager Modes, urging leaders to build systems that unlock their team's full potential, rather than focusing on outdated, heroic leadership models.

Suggest ways to make the essay more fluxy

### Assistant - 2024-09-11 20:46:03

To make the essay more FLUXy, consider incorporating clever wordplay, metaphors, pop culture references, and playful contrasts to engage the reader and convey complexity in a light yet impactful way. Here are some suggestions:

### 1. **Introduce Playful, Metaphorical Language**
   - **Founder Mode as Superpowers**: Compare "Founder Mode" to superheroes who realize they can‚Äôt save the world alone. Reference characters like Iron Man or Spider-Man realizing that "with great power comes great responsibility," including the responsibility to build a team.
   - **The ‚ÄúThermocline of Truth‚Äù**: This term is already engaging but could be expanded to a metaphor like "breaking through the organizational glass bottom" or "surfacing below the smooth waters."
   - **Founder Mode as a House of Cards**: Compare ineffective founder leadership to a house of cards that looks stable but crumbles with the slightest pressure.

### 2. **Pop Culture References and Wordplay**
   - **The Eye of Sauron**: Lean into the reference. Call leaders who obsessively micromanage "Saurons-in-training" or "Eyes Wide Shut," playing on the film title to imply that excessive focus actually blinds leaders.
   - **Ted Lasso**: Use more allusions to *Ted Lasso*‚Äîcall founder-led teams ‚ÄúRoy Kents‚Äù (trying to do everything) versus teams embracing total football as ‚ÄúRichmond Greyhounds‚Äù (balanced, resilient).
   - **Founder Mode as Mythology**: Reference Greek mythology‚ÄîZeus (founder) throwing thunderbolts (micromanaging) versus Prometheus giving fire to humans (empowering teams).

### 3. **Juxtaposition and Clever Contrasts**
   - **"Hero Mode vs. Zero Mode"**: Describe the founder who tries to do everything as being in "Hero Mode," which turns into "Zero Mode" when everything crumbles because the system depends on one person.
   - **"Seagull Leadership vs. Eagle Vision"**: Play with the idea of seagull management, contrasting it with "eagle-eyed" leaders who are strategic but not micromanagers.

### 4. **Interactive Language**
   - Ask provocative questions like, "Do you want to be the Founder Hero, or the Team Captain?" or "Is your team playing checkers while you‚Äôre stuck playing solitaire?"
   - Use quick metaphors: "Think of Founder Mode like spinning plates. The faster you go, the more plates you need‚Äîbut how many will fall before you realize you need help?"

### 5. **Lighten the Tone with Humor**
   - "Founder Mode might be great for building empires, but you‚Äôre not Augustus‚Äîand this isn‚Äôt ancient Rome."
   - "Think of micromanagement like cooking pasta: if you keep poking it to check, you‚Äôre never going to get al dente."

Incorporating these suggestions will infuse the essay with a FLUXy vibe‚Äîplayful yet insightful, challenging established thinking while keeping the tone fresh and accessible.

Suggest ways to make it more fluxy in the systematic, thoughtful, optimistic but realistic sort of way

### Assistant - 2024-09-11 20:46:57

To make the essay more FLUXy in a **systematic, thoughtful, and optimistic yet realistic** way, here are several strategies to refine the tone and structure without losing depth or practicality:

### 1. **Reframe Problems as Opportunities for Growth**
   - **Shift the narrative from "Fixing" to "Evolving"**: Instead of framing Founder Mode as something to "fix," present it as an opportunity to evolve into a more adaptable, sustainable leadership model. This makes the essay feel more forward-thinking. For instance, "Founder Mode is a powerful starting point‚Äînow let‚Äôs take that energy and channel it into systems that can thrive without constant intervention."
   
   - **Highlight Empowerment**: Emphasize that the evolution from Founder Mode to a more decentralized model isn't about relinquishing control but about empowering others to contribute at their highest capacity. Frame it as a win-win: "The beauty of evolving beyond Founder Mode is that you empower people to do their best work‚Äîwork that you couldn‚Äôt do alone."

### 2. **Introduce Stepwise, Actionable Progressions**
   - **Create a Structured Pathway**: Offer a clear, step-by-step guide for transitioning from Founder Mode to a more sustainable leadership model. This can take the form of phases, such as:
     - **Phase 1: Awareness** ‚Äì Recognize the limitations of Founder Mode.
     - **Phase 2: Empowerment** ‚Äì Develop leadership capacity within the team.
     - **Phase 3: Systematization** ‚Äì Build processes that can thrive without founder intervention.
     - **Phase 4: Iteration** ‚Äì Continuously refine and improve leadership systems based on feedback.
   
   This systematic approach helps the reader see a clear path forward, while maintaining an optimistic tone about growth potential.

### 3. **Acknowledge the Human Side of Leadership**
   - **Humanize the Founder‚Äôs Journey**: Recognize that the desire for control often stems from fear or passion‚Äî"Founder Mode often comes from a place of deep care. Leaders don‚Äôt want to fail; they want to ensure success. The challenge is learning to trust others with the same level of care, knowing that success isn‚Äôt something you build alone."
   
   - **Leverage Psychological Safety**: Shift the conversation about psychological safety from being about avoiding punishment to one about fostering learning and openness. "When people feel safe to speak up, they aren‚Äôt just helping avoid mistakes‚Äîthey‚Äôre helping to create a culture where learning and innovation thrive."

### 4. **Balance Optimism with Realism**
   - **Celebrate Small Wins**: Encourage leaders to look for small, tangible improvements along the way. "The journey from Founder Mode to sustainable leadership doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. But each time you empower someone to make a key decision, you‚Äôre building toward something bigger."
   
   - **Recognize Limitations Thoughtfully**: Be realistic about the challenges but present them as surmountable. "Yes, scaling a company‚Äôs culture beyond a founder's direct involvement is hard. But the alternative‚Äîburnout, lack of scalability, and talent churn‚Äîis harder."

### 5. **Use Systems Thinking to Frame Leadership Evolution**
   - **Draw on the Power of Networks**: Rather than seeing leadership as a hierarchy, reframe it as a network of interdependent systems. "Think of your organization as a neural network‚Äîstrong when the right signals are passed through multiple channels, weak when all signals must funnel through one source."
   
   - **Feedback Loops**: Highlight the importance of feedback loops in leadership and decision-making. "In Founder Mode, feedback loops can be too short and narrow‚Äîeverything flows back to the founder. By widening and lengthening those loops, you can gather more data, perspectives, and ultimately make more informed decisions."

### 6. **Introduce a Concept of Leadership as Legacy-Building**
   - **From Founder to Legacy**: Introduce the idea that great founders build something that outlasts them. "The real test of a founder‚Äôs success isn‚Äôt how well they can hold the reins, but how well they‚Äôve set the stage for others to run with the vision. When you move beyond Founder Mode, you‚Äôre not just building a company‚Äîyou‚Äôre building a legacy."
   
   - **Long-Term Thinking**: Make a case for long-term thinking. "Founder Mode often focuses on the here and now, putting out fires and solving problems in real-time. But by stepping back, creating systems, and empowering your team, you‚Äôre investing in the long-term health and growth of the organization."

### 7. **Weave in Optimistic yet Pragmatic Metaphors**
   - **The Relay Race**: Use a metaphor like a relay race, where the founder‚Äôs role is to run the first leg but the real success comes when the baton is smoothly passed to others. "A successful founder isn‚Äôt the one who runs the entire race alone, but the one who builds a team capable of sprinting past the finish line."
   
   - **Gardening vs. Architecture**: Compare leadership to tending a garden rather than constructing a building. "Founder Mode is like building the garden framework, but it‚Äôs the careful, ongoing tending‚Äîthe nurturing of different plants, the adaptation to changing conditions‚Äîthat allows it to flourish."

By systematically blending optimism with realism, reinforcing leadership as a shared, evolving process, and introducing a thoughtful structure, the essay can become more FLUXy‚Äîforward-looking, realistic, and engaging in a way that feels dynamic and actionable.

Compress these paragraphs intro paragraph and one reasonably concise concise crique paragraph. Keep the specifics.

It invites leaders to indulge fears that their reports are secretly "professional fakers" who have been covering up their failures by ‚Äúmanaging up‚Äù for years? But if we dig a bit deeper, perhaps we can find a version of founder mode that is robust.

The seductive version of founder mode suggests that one can fix a systemic problem with sufficient heroism. Founders have unique insight and authority which allow them to fix things. Unfortunately this type of founder mode won't scale. When it's done by non-founders it becomes micromanagement.

Founder Mode is a popular idea in tech leadership, often serving as a vague but tempting lens through which leaders view their teams, suspecting them of "managing up" to hide failures. Despite this allure, there may be a more sustainable version of Founder Mode worth exploring.

However, the seductive version of Founder Mode, where founders believe they can heroically solve systemic problems, doesn't scale. When applied by non-founders, it turns into micromanagement, relying on the founder‚Äôs unique authority for legitimacy. Too often, it becomes an excuse for poor leadership, avoiding responsibility for dysfunctional cultures and failing to address deeper systemic issues, leaving companies adrift without meaningful direction.
