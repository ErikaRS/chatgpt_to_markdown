    - Stanley and Lehman explore the myth of the objective. When we focus on ambitious objectives—concrete, specific goals—we are setting ourselves up for failure. Objectives can be useful when we're looking at changes that are adjacent to where we already are. However, when our goal is major innovation, objectives actively hinder progress. The path between where we are today and the objective is often indirect and may require moving away from a seemingly direct path.
    - The authors refer to these intermediate discoveries as stepping stones. The myth of the objective assumes that the best way to pursue an objective is to follow the stepping stones that are nearest to the ultimate goal: the objective becomes the objective __function__. But this is like trying to go through a maze by always taking the path that points toward the exit. The true path is much more roundabout. The objective is a false compass. 
    - This might not be so bad if we had good visibility of the possible paths between here and there. However, to continue with the stepping stone metaphor, these stepping stones are in a foggy landscape. The objective is tempting because we cannot see the full set of paths available to us. We want some way to navigate through the fog. However, as the authors emphasize, following a false compass is no better than not having one. Although I find their claim about objectives as a false compass compelling in the end, I did find the argument itself to be fairly weak. It was mostly argued from example and focused rather too much on the exact paths by which innovations were reached: sure, our path to computers involved vacuum tubes, but that doesn't mean that vacuum tubes were the only path to computers (especially given that we didn't __stay__ at vacuum tubes). 
    - If objectives provide a false compass, what are we to do? Do we just wander around randomly and hope for good luck? No. We can be more intentional than that. The authors encourage us to utilize non-objective search. Instead of measuring progress against a destination, exploration is driven by some measurement relative to the present. 
    - This measurement has two parts. First, there are constraints or backstops. Some paths should be avoided because we cannot actually make our way through them. Constraints include physical laws (e.g., the speed of light), continued ability to participate (an organism that dies too quickly can't reproduce), and domain specific requirements (medicine should not do harm). Constraints tell you where not to go. Second, there should be something points us in a direction. The authors are particularly fond of novelty search, which follows the direction that is most interesting (for some domain relevant definition of interesting). The important part is that both constraints and guiding principles are relative to the present, not to some unrealized future state. __From here__, don't go a direction that will kill you. __From here__, go the direction which looks the most interesting. 
    - This general idea is not completely incompatible objectives. The authors argue convincingly that we shouldn't use objectives as objective functions, as the measure of which direction is best to go. That will cause us to miss necessary detours. However, can't we use objectives as part of a more nuanced guiding methodology? The authors encourage us to completely abandon objectives. Instead of trying to have any control over the direction we go, if we want to be innovative, we should become treasure hunters. We should always follow the path that is the most interesting. That path may lead us places that are incredibly innovative, but we won't know where we are going in advance. 
    - I didn't find this part of the argument completely compelling.Overall, I still feel like objectives can be useful. I agree that treasure hunting is __one__ way to innovate. It may be the only way to achieve truly groundbreaking innovations. However, there is a spectrum between objective-friendly adjacent inventions and major innovation. Even if we cannot achieve an objective in full, the interesting things we discovery on the way will likely be more aligned with the goal of the objective than if we just wander about following what is interesting or novel—even if we can't solve world hunger, trying is likely to at least reduce hunger. The problems come when we conflate objectives—places we want to go—with objective functions—measures of how close we are to being there. 
    - However, I do agree that objectives make terrible fitness functions. If we measure progress only by measuring distance from the ideal, then we'll likely get stuck at a boring dead end. I agree with the fundamental assertion that when we are determining which next step to take, we should use an objective function that measure progress relative to where we are now, not relative to some particular place we want to be.
    - Maybe instead of objectives we can think of north stars. A north star is something which guides your direction. It is not a destination you can ever reach. A north star reduces the number of next steps to consider. Since we never expect to reach a north star, we don't measure success against the north star. Rather, we measure success by what we achieved while going that direction. Let's replace the objective, in the negative sense used in this book, with the north star. Let's allow ourselves to wander, and also allow ourselves a general direction to that wandering. Perhaps Stanley and Lehman might say that makes a north star more like a constraint, something which defines which directions not to go. However, from a psychological perspective, I think that the positive framing of a north star is more inspiring than a constraint. 
    - Despite the fact that this book was not as well argued as I would like, I believe that it was worth the read because it caused me to think more deeply about objectives rather than just blindly accepting them as the way things should be done.
- An essay::
    - I recently finished reading [__Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned__](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25670869-why-greatness-cannot-be-planned). The basic thesis is that setting objectives is futile for significant innovation. Objectives can be useful for incremental improvements, but for innovation, we do not know that the path that progress requires. Measuring incremental improvements against the final goal is likely to result in the pursuit of dead ends that seem like they should be moving closer but which are actually missing a vital stepping stone. The vital stepping stones usually require going in a non-obvious direction. You can read more in [my goodreads review ](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3547109271).
    - As [[Dart Lindsley]] noted in our [[GALE]] book club discussion of this book, the argument presented in the book is somewhat lacking. It focuses overly much on the particular path that was used to get to some interesting end. E.g., "Computers are great! They needed vacuum tubes. Who would have thought __that__ when first trying to invent computers?" Dart observes this assumes that reaching a particular objective is fully path dependent: there is only one particular way to get there from here. In practice, there are likely to be multiple ways to get to a particular end. Vacuum tubes may have been how we first got to scalable computation, but they likely were not the only path to silicon. Bicycles may have been one path to commercial flight, but that doesn't mean they're the only one.

Your summary of *Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective* by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman reflects a thoughtful engagement with the book’s critique of goal-oriented thinking, especially in the context of innovation.

The idea that objectives can limit innovation—by locking attention onto seemingly direct paths—resonates with certain FLUX Review insights on embracing *emergence* and *complexity* over rigid goal-setting. FLUX often advocates for a more open-ended exploration, valuing *novelty* and *non-linear* paths as key drivers for discovery. This aligns with the book’s idea of "stepping stones" and "novelty search."

Your suggestion to replace objectives with "north stars" is a nuanced reframe, keeping the exploration open while providing a sense of direction without limiting the scope of possibility—a concept FLUX could align with in its discussion on *adaptive systems* and *long-term thinking*.

Incorporating the FLUX lens, you could also view this through a *systems thinking* perspective: the authors are advocating for navigating complex, multi-dimensional landscapes by focusing on *local interactions* and emergent patterns rather than pre-determined end states.

If you'd like, I can help unpack these parallels further!

In FLUX, we've been discussing the importance of stepping stones for creativity and how one of the challenges with AI is that it takes away the journey, the steps along the way that can lead to serendipitous discovery. 

Write a book for your shelf style summary of why greatness cannot be planned which pulls from my notes and includes a reflection on ai and serendipity. The tone should be thoughtful, as appropriate for a group that is generally very pro ai but also isn't blind to the challenges and limitations. 

Like other flux book summaries, it should be 1 to three paragraphs long and roughly have the format: 1-2 sentences about how it is fluxy. 1 paragraph summarizing the key points through from the flux perspective. 1 paragraph with some insights connecting it to other ideas. One short concluding paragraph on why this is a worthwhile flux read

__Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective__ by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman explores the dangers of rigid goal-setting, arguing that greatness—especially in innovation—emerges not from direct pursuit but from an open-ended, stepping-stone process. This aligns with FLUX's core belief in emergent complexity and non-linear pathways as vital for creative and adaptive systems. The book challenges the assumption that clear objectives lead to the best outcomes, pointing instead to serendipity and detours as essential drivers of true progress.

From a FLUX perspective, Stanley and Lehman's concept of "stepping stones" echoes our discussions about adaptive learning and innovation within systems thinking. They critique the "myth of the objective," where following a predetermined goal can prevent the exploration of adjacent possibilities. Objectives can guide incremental improvements, but for major breakthroughs, the terrain is too unpredictable, requiring us to explore unexpected directions. The authors advocate for "novelty search," an approach that values curiosity and local progress over distant goals, resonating with FLUX's endorsement of emergent, decentralized processes. Interestingly, the book highlights how our fixation on objectives creates blind spots, leading us to miss out on key innovations hidden in seemingly unrelated paths—a concept we've discussed in relation to creative constraints and the necessity of exploratory freedom.

One of the challenges for AI in this context is that while it can be highly efficient at reaching predefined goals, it risks bypassing the journey—the trial and error, the dead ends, the serendipitous discoveries—that are often crucial to creative breakthroughs. While AI can optimize paths and automate solutions, the "stepping stones" that lead to unexpected innovation often require meandering, open-ended exploration that AI, in its current forms, can struggle to replicate. As FLUX advocates for being both pro-AI and clear-eyed about its limitations, *Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned* provides a thoughtful reflection on the potential cost of over-reliance on goal-oriented systems, offering a valuable caution for maintaining the human, exploratory dimension of innovation.

This is a worthwhile FLUX read because it deepens our understanding of how emergent creativity functions and invites us to consider how we can incorporate both AI and human curiosity into systems designed for serendipitous discovery.

__Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective__ by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman argues that rigid goal-setting stifles creativity and innovation. Instead of pursuing ambitious objectives head-on, the authors suggest that the most groundbreaking discoveries emerge through a more indirect, stepping-stone process. This book challenges the conventional wisdom that clear objectives lead to success, advocating for exploration driven by novelty and local progress rather than distant goals.

Stanley and Lehman’s critique of objectives points to the risk of becoming trapped by the illusion of progress, where seemingly logical next steps actually lead to dead ends. Their concept of "novelty search" emphasizes that innovation often requires detours, and that valuable discoveries may lie far from the direct path toward a defined goal. This approach highlights the unpredictable and emergent nature of creative breakthroughs, where exploration and curiosity reveal new opportunities. It also warns against using objectives as measures of success, as doing so can blind us to the necessary diversions that foster true progress.

A key insight here connects to AI and its role in creativity. While AI excels at optimizing known paths, it can shortcut the exploratory journey—skipping the intermediate steps that, although inefficient, often lead to serendipitous discoveries. The risk is that in optimizing for clear objectives, we might lose the wandering, trial-and-error processes that drive human creativity and innovation. This book serves as a reminder that, even in an era of powerful technology, maintaining openness to the unexpected remains essential for achieving greatness.

This is a valuable read because it challenges the dominant narratives around goal-setting and offers a fresh perspective on how innovation truly unfolds. It invites reflection on how we balance efficiency with the openness needed for discovery.

Add a bit how ai can also aid in creatively and serendipity by allowing people to dig more deeply and more quickly into ideas. It is not that gen aI is or is not a creative tool. It's that it enables a different kind of creativity while making others harder

This approach warns against relying on objectives as measures of success, since doing so can blind us to the detours that drive true progress.

Interestingly, AI introduces both opportunities and challenges to this dynamic. On the one hand, AI can accelerate the exploratory process, allowing us to dig more deeply and more quickly into ideas, unearthing new connections at speeds that would be impossible for a human alone. In this sense, it can enable a different kind of creativity, expanding the range of what we can explore. Yet, by optimizing for objectives, AI can also bypass the wandering, trial-and-error processes that often lead to serendipitous discoveries. It’s not that generative AI is or isn’t a creative tool—it simply fosters one kind of creativity while making others harder to access. The tension lies in balancing efficiency with the openness that exploration requires.

This is a valuable read because it challenges the dominant narratives around goal-setting and offers a fresh perspective on how innovation truly unfolds. It invites reflection on how both human curiosity and AI's capabilities can coexist to maintain the conditions for discovery.

__Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective__ by Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman challenges the idea that ambitious objectives lead to innovation. Instead, the authors argue that true breakthroughs come from exploring indirect paths—what they call "stepping stones"—rather than following a direct line toward a goal. The book pushes against conventional wisdom, suggesting that the pursuit of distant objectives often blinds us to unexpected opportunities along the way.

The key insight here is the idea of "novelty search," which values curiosity and exploration over rigid goal-setting. Innovation, the authors argue, thrives on detours and local progress, and using objectives as benchmarks for success can cause us to miss the necessary deviations that lead to real breakthroughs. By focusing too narrowly on reaching an end goal, we risk overlooking the value of wandering, where the most transformative discoveries often occur.

Although generative AI hadn’t yet gone mainstream when this book was published in 2015, its ideas resonate deeply with how AI is used today. AI enables a different kind of creativity, accelerating the process of digging deeply into ideas and surfacing novel connections. Yet, by optimizing for objectives, AI can also sidestep the serendipitous discoveries that often arise from wandering and experimentation. The challenge is not whether AI is a creative tool—it’s how we balance the speed and efficiency AI offers with the kind of open-ended exploration that drives human creativity.

This book is a worthwhile read because it invites us to rethink how we approach innovation, encouraging openness to exploration over rigid goal-setting—a lesson that feels especially relevant in our increasingly AI-driven world.

But as the book warns, optimizing for clear objectives can sometimes skip the meandering, trial-and-error processes that lead to serendipitous discoveries. The challenge today is not whether AI is creative, but how we balance its efficiency with the kind of open-ended exploration that drives human innovation—the very wandering that Stanley and Lehman highlight as crucial for uncovering hidden stepping stones.

This book is a worthwhile read because it invites us to rethink how we approach innovation, encouraging openness to exploration over rigid goals—a lesson that feels especially relevant as AI reshapes how we navigate creativity and discovery.
