I am head of engineering at a small startup company. The co-founders, the CEO and CTO, are highly technical but not great people managers. (The CEO is okay app management. The CTO is terrible at it.) They both acknowledge that I am a better people manager and they highly value that that is something I bring to the organization and that it needs. I've gotten both directed and direct feedback that they highly respect me. Still, they frequently both give me feedback that are variations of me being not harsh enough. As a people manager. They say that I coddle people or that I need to push people to be more tough on their team. The problem being chad, while I cannot prove they're wrong, from a results perspective, all of the evidence is on the side of my approach. As is the management literature. So I am considering quitting because I am tired of constantly having people who are clearly less skilled than I am, so I can guess my judgments. I want them to get out of my way and let me do my job., but chad doesn't seem to be working. The problem is, I'm pretty critical to the company. I'm pretty certain that if I left, the engineering organization, possibly the whole end product and design or would fall apart. Our relationships with the go to market team would deteriorate. And probably there would be other attrition that is both directly attributable to my leaving and indirectly attributable as part of things going wrong. So, how do I quit in these circumstances? I do feel a sense of moral obligation towards the people. Not towards the CEO and the CTO, but towards all of the individuals who are working so hard to try to make this company successful.

The user is head of engineering at a small startup company where the co-founders (the CEO and CTO) are highly technical but poor people managers. They frequently give the user feedback about being "not harsh enough" as a people manager, saying they coddle people or need to push others to be tougher on their teams. While the user has received both directed and direct feedback that they are respected and valued for their people management skills, they are frustrated by this criticism and tired of having their judgments second-guessed by less skilled people. The user is considering quitting, feeling that their approach is backed by management literature and results. They also feel a sense of moral obligation toward the rest of the team, who are working hard to make the company successful, and are concerned that their departure could cause significant disruption and attrition across engineering, go-to-market, and product and design teams.

It sounds like you're in a very difficult position, feeling the weight of both your own values and the responsibility you have for the people and the organization. Given the critical role you play, it’s important to balance your exit in a way that honors your sense of obligation while also protecting your own well-being and professional satisfaction.

Here are a few steps to consider as you think through this:

1. **Engage in one final conversation**: Since your CEO and CTO have shown they respect you, it may be worth having an honest, no-holds-barred conversation with them. Frame it as a serious discussion about your future at the company. Emphasize that their feedback is undermining your ability to do the job you're respected for, and that it's pushing you toward considering leaving. Ask them if they can trust you to handle the people management aspect fully, without ongoing second-guessing, since your results have consistently been positive.

2. **Plan for a smooth transition**: If leaving is the decision, create a clear plan for transitioning out. Identify key stakeholders who would be most affected by your departure and start working on knowledge transfer, grooming potential successors, and preparing teams to function without you. This will help ensure that the organization doesn’t collapse when you leave, mitigating the risk of massive attrition or instability.

3. **Offer a consulting period**: You might offer to stay on as a consultant post-departure for a limited time. This would ensure continuity without having you feel trapped in the current environment. Consulting could allow you to step back from day-to-day frustrations while still supporting the team that you care about.

4. **Build bridges for the team**: If possible, find ways to mentor key people before you leave, helping them develop the skills they’ll need to weather potential disruptions. You might also help some of them find external roles if the company’s future looks unstable without you.

5. **Focus on long-term personal alignment**: Ultimately, your professional alignment and long-term growth matter. If the company isn’t respecting your management approach and doesn’t change, staying could lead to burnout. Leaving may be hard, but it’s important to preserve your professional principles and not continue in a space where they’re consistently undervalued.

Balancing the departure in a way that still shows care for your team is key, but it’s clear that your sense of values and evidence-based management approaches are pushing you to seek a healthier, more supportive environment for your talents.

Now, let's look at the flip side perspective. I might be having a strong reaction because this last week was worse than normal about these kind of things. Guy, might I approach the situation if I want to acknowledge that this is a real and serious problem but try to move forward and make both myself and the company successful?

The user is considering that their reaction to their situation at work might be stronger than usual because the past week was particularly difficult. They want to explore ways to acknowledge the problem as real and serious while trying to move forward and make both themselves and the company successful.

If you're leaning toward staying and working through the challenges, here's how you might approach it to both acknowledge the problem and move forward constructively:

1. **Reflect on the past week**: Start by recognizing that a particularly tough week can amplify frustration. Take some time to reflect on whether this week was an exception or if it’s part of a broader pattern. If it was an outlier, acknowledging that can help you reframe the situation with a bit more patience. If it's a pattern, then you’re already aware there’s a deeper issue to address.

2. **Separate the feedback from emotion**: It’s important to take a step back and analyze the feedback about "being too soft" objectively. Are there any elements that might be worth considering, even if they were delivered poorly? You might find that there are small adjustments you can make without compromising your core values. For example, you could explore ways to be both empathetic and hold people more accountable without being perceived as “harsh.”

3. **Reiterate your value**: In a discussion with the CEO and CTO, reaffirm the value you bring in people management, especially the results you’ve delivered. Make it clear that while you’re open to feedback, you believe your approach is effective. You can position this conversation as a step toward finding common ground: You acknowledge that they want a certain level of toughness, and you're willing to meet them halfway by identifying specific areas where you can be firmer without compromising your leadership style.

4. **Request specific examples**: If the feedback continues, ask for concrete examples where they feel you could have been tougher. This shifts the conversation from vague generalizations to actionable items. By addressing specific situations, you can either explain your reasoning or find a middle ground for future decisions.

5. **Build trust through small experiments**: Suggest trying small adjustments to your management approach as an experiment. Frame it as a temporary trial to test if slight changes make a positive impact. This way, you can meet them halfway without feeling like you're compromising your values entirely. Afterward, you can review the results and decide if it's worth continuing those adjustments.

6. **Define success together**: Have a candid conversation with the CEO and CTO about what success looks like from their perspective and yours. If they want more "toughness," discuss what that means in terms of measurable outcomes (e.g., team performance, delivery timelines). Defining success collaboratively can help align expectations.

7. **Develop coping strategies for tough weeks**: If weeks like this past one tend to crop up, it might be worth developing personal coping strategies to manage the stress better. Whether it’s setting clearer boundaries, taking mental breaks, or finding an outlet to debrief, these strategies can help you weather the tougher periods without letting them erode your overall perspective.

By addressing the issue directly while maintaining a solutions-oriented mindset, you might be able to realign yourself with the company's leadership and create an environment where both your approach and their expectations coexist more effectively.

Now combine these two plans into a plan that gives me the best odds of being successful and being able to help the company on my own terms with being ready with a easy to deploy exit strategy if things don't improve

### Assistant - 2024-10-06 09:45:26



### Assistant - 2024-10-06 09:45:26

Here's an integrated plan that balances your goal of moving forward constructively while preparing an exit strategy if the situation doesn't improve. This dual approach lets you take proactive steps to improve the environment while keeping your options open if things don't work out as you hope.

### **Phase 1: Reflect and Reframe**
1. **Take a Step Back**: Acknowledge that the last week was especially difficult and reflect on whether your current reaction is tied to this isolated situation or a larger pattern of frustration. If it's a rough patch, this reflection will help you avoid overreacting. If it's a recurring problem, it underscores the need for action.

2. **Separate Emotion from Feedback**: Objectively assess the feedback you've received. Ask yourself if there are any valid points you can act on without compromising your core values. This is about distinguishing feedback you can learn from versus feedback that doesn’t align with your leadership style.

### **Phase 2: Open Dialogue and Collaboration**
3. **Engage in a Candid Conversation**: Schedule a direct, no-holds-barred conversation with your CEO and CTO. Reiterate the respect they’ve shown for your people management skills, but be clear about the challenges you're facing with their feedback. Highlight that, based on results and management literature, your approach is sound. Emphasize that this situation is creating tension for you and ask them to step back and let you fully own the people management aspect.

4. **Request Specifics**: Ask them to provide concrete examples where they feel you're not being "tough enough." This makes the conversation less about vague perceptions and more about actionable instances. Be clear that you're open to improving, but you need this feedback to be constructive, not undermining.

5. **Negotiate a Compromise**: Propose small adjustments to your approach as an experiment. Frame it as a trial to see if being slightly firmer in certain situations (as they suggest) leads to better outcomes. This demonstrates your willingness to collaborate without compromising your core management style.

6. **Define Success Together**: Collaboratively establish what success looks like from both your perspective and theirs. By aligning on measurable outcomes (e.g., delivery timelines, team productivity), you can set clearer expectations for what "being tough" should accomplish, ensuring you’re both working toward the same goals.

### **Phase 3: Build Resilience and Prepare for Long-Term Success**
7. **Implement Personal Coping Strategies**: As you work on improving the situation, develop strategies for managing stress during tough weeks. Whether it’s setting clearer boundaries, taking short mental breaks, or finding support, these will help you stay grounded and reduce burnout from recurring challenges.

8. **Reiterate Your Value**: Throughout these conversations, continue to remind the CEO and CTO of your past successes in people management and team building. The data and results are on your side—highlight this regularly as a reminder that your approach works.

### **Phase 4: Prepare a Smooth Exit Strategy**
9. **Develop a Transition Plan**: Quietly start preparing for an exit, just in case the situation doesn’t improve. Identify key team members who could take on more responsibility and begin mentoring them in the event that you leave. This will ensure continuity for your team without signaling that you're preparing to depart.

10. **Create a Knowledge Transfer Outline**: Prepare a list of critical tasks, processes, and relationships that would need to be handed over. You don’t need to act on this immediately, but having it ready will ease the transition if you choose to leave.

11. **Offer a Consulting Period**: If things don’t improve and you decide to leave, consider offering to stay on as a consultant for a limited time post-departure. This will allow you to continue supporting the team without being tied to the day-to-day frustrations.

12. **Monitor Progress**: Set a clear timeline for when you expect to see progress in your discussions with the CEO and CTO. If, after a set period (e.g., 3 to 6 months), you don't see meaningful change in how they respect your people management role, you can implement your exit plan without hesitation.

### **Phase 5: Decision Point**
13. **Evaluate the Situation**: After the trial period (whether 3, 6 months, etc.), assess how things have changed. If the CEO and CTO have improved in respecting your autonomy and there’s less second-guessing, continue investing in your role. If not, proceed with your exit strategy.

14. **Make a Final Decision**: If you stay, commit to building the company on your terms, using the lessons learned from this process. If you leave, do so knowing you’ve prepared the team to handle the transition smoothly and you’ve fulfilled your moral obligations to them.

### The Outcome
This plan gives you the flexibility to work toward improving the situation while ensuring you're not caught off guard if the company’s leadership doesn't give you the space you need. It strikes a balance between asserting your value and preparing to exit in a way that minimizes disruption.

### User - 2024-10-06 09:46:35

This is a fast moving company in a fast moving industry, Joy project. This plan onto a 2-month set of actions. Add in concrete signals I can look for to see whether or not things are improving and add check points for those too

### Assistant - 2024-10-06 09:47:19

To adapt this plan into a fast-moving two-month action plan with concrete signals and checkpoints, the timeline will be more condensed and focused. Here’s the refined plan:

### **Phase 1: Week 1 - Reflect and Reframe**
1. **Take a Step Back**: Use the first week to reflect on the past few weeks, especially the recent frustrations. Separate this reflection from immediate reactions and consider the pattern versus the one-off nature of your concerns. Journaling or seeking a sounding board from a trusted peer/mentor might help clarify whether you’re reacting to a bad week or deeper issues.

   - **Checkpoint Signal (End of Week 1):** Have you been able to look at the situation with more perspective? Can you identify clear, recurring problems, or was this largely driven by recent stress?

### **Phase 2: Week 2 - Engage in Candid Conversation**
2. **Candid Conversation with CEO & CTO**: Schedule a direct conversation to address the feedback around your management style. Frame this as an opportunity for open dialogue about your role in managing people and expectations moving forward. Be clear that you need autonomy to perform your role effectively and explain the need to avoid micromanagement or undermining.

   - **Concrete Signal (End of Week 2):** Look for verbal and non-verbal cues—did they acknowledge the issue and express commitment to giving you more autonomy? Did they understand the specific examples you presented where their feedback was undermining rather than helpful?

### **Phase 3: Weeks 3 & 4 - Negotiate Small Adjustments & Define Success**
3. **Request Specific Examples**: Ask for real-world examples of when they felt you should have been tougher. Use this time to get a concrete understanding of their concerns and be prepared to counter with results or explanations of your reasoning.

4. **Negotiate an Experiment**: Propose trying a small adjustment to your management approach for two weeks. Frame it as an experiment to align their desire for “toughness” with your people-centric style. Pick 1-2 areas where you’re willing to try a firmer stance.

   - **Concrete Signal (Week 4 Checkpoint):** Did you receive specific examples, and were you able to negotiate a practical experiment? Is the feedback moving from vague generalizations to clear, actionable points? Are they responding positively to the adjustments?

5. **Define Success Together**: Work with them to agree on what success looks like, including measurable outcomes. For example, team productivity, hitting delivery deadlines, or team satisfaction. Establish this during these two weeks to clarify expectations on both sides.

   - **Concrete Signal (End of Week 4):** Are you aligned on specific outcomes? Has there been a productive, mutual agreement on how to measure success? Look for whether these expectations feel reasonable and achievable within your framework.

### **Phase 4: Weeks 5-6 - Build Resilience and Observe Feedback**
6. **Implement Adjustments**: Begin your trial of being slightly firmer in 1-2 key areas. Monitor how your teams respond and the effect on productivity and morale. During these weeks, observe both team dynamics and how the CEO and CTO react to your leadership adjustments.

7. **Coping Strategies for Tough Weeks**: Simultaneously, focus on developing strategies to reduce burnout. Whether it’s taking quick breaks, mental resets, or confiding in peers, ensure you have mechanisms in place to manage any rough periods. 

   - **Concrete Signal (Week 6 Checkpoint):** After two weeks of small adjustments, check in with yourself and the team. Are you still comfortable with your approach? Are the CEO and CTO backing off? Are team outcomes improving, and do you feel less pressure from leadership?

### **Phase 5: Week 7 - Prepare Exit Contingency**
8. **Develop an Exit Strategy**: Quietly begin working on a transition plan, identifying key people who could take over your responsibilities and knowledge transfer tasks. Begin documenting processes and identifying potential interim leaders.

   - **Concrete Signal (End of Week 7):** Look for how the team is responding to your leadership—are they demonstrating increased confidence or resilience without needing constant input? Can you see someone stepping into a greater leadership role, if needed?

9. **Communicate Consulting Option**: As part of your quiet preparation, consider drafting an offer to stay on as a consultant if things do not improve and you decide to leave. This gives you flexibility and shows you’re committed to a smooth transition, even if you exit.

### **Phase 6: Week 8 - Decision Point and Final Review**
10. **Review Progress with CEO & CTO**: At the two-month mark, schedule a final conversation with leadership. Review the progress made during your trial adjustments. Discuss whether their feedback has improved and if they’ve given you the autonomy you need. 

11. **Evaluate Next Steps**: Based on the outcomes and feedback at this point, decide if you can successfully continue under improved conditions or if it’s time to move on. If you choose to leave, deploy your exit strategy, offering the consulting option and preparing the team for transition.

   - **Concrete Signal (End of Week 8 Checkpoint):** Is there significant improvement in leadership’s respect for your autonomy? Are they trusting you to manage people without undermining your decisions? If not, are you ready to implement the exit strategy with minimal disruption to the company?

---

### **Key Checkpoints and Signals**
- **Week 1 Reflection:** Gained perspective on whether the situation is driven by temporary stress or ongoing frustrations.
- **Week 2 Conversation:** Clear commitment from CEO & CTO to give you space, along with positive feedback on your directness.
- **Week 4 Negotiation:** Agreed-upon metrics for success, with concrete examples to focus on.
- **Week 6 Team & CEO/CTO Response:** Evidence that your adjustments are working or not, both from your team’s response and from leadership backing off.
- **Week 7 Exit Plan Readiness:** Transition plans are in place and consulting option drafted for smooth exit if needed.
- **Week 8 Final Review:** Decision point based on progress and signals. If things haven’t improved, you're ready to execute your exit strategy.

This condensed action plan focuses on rapid improvements while maintaining readiness to leave if you don’t see the needed changes within two months.

### Tool (bio) - 2024-10-06 09:49:07

Model set context updated.

### Assistant - 2024-10-06 09:49:07

Here’s the revised plan, with earlier behind-the-scenes exit planning and no reliance on the CEO or CTO for success. The focus is entirely on what you can control, ensuring you are prepared for both staying and exiting without requiring their input or effort.

### **Phase 1: Week 1 - Reflect, Reframe, and Start Exit Preparation**
1. **Reflect on the Situation**: Spend the first few days reflecting on whether this recent frustration is a temporary issue or a longer-term pattern. Use this as a checkpoint to see if the situation has escalated recently or has been building up over time.

2. **Quietly Begin Exit Planning**: Regardless of how you feel at the end of your reflection, start behind-the-scenes exit planning early. Identify key responsibilities that will need to be transitioned and key individuals who could take over your tasks if needed. Begin documenting critical processes and outlining the knowledge transfer you would need to hand off.

   - **Checkpoint Signal (End of Week 1):** Do you have a rough outline of a transition plan? Are you clear on who would need to take over key responsibilities?

### **Phase 2: Weeks 2 & 3 - Take Control of Your Leadership and Start Small Adjustments**
3. **Continue to Lead as You See Fit**: In this phase, double down on your people management style. Don't adjust for the sake of the CEO or CTO; instead, make small tweaks to increase accountability or toughness if you feel it's warranted based on your own assessment. Do this only if it aligns with your style.

4. **Monitor Reactions Without Expecting Change**: Don't expect the CEO or CTO to give you more autonomy or feedback. Instead, focus on your own team’s response. Are they performing well? How is morale? Use this period to fine-tune your leadership based on real results, not external feedback.

   - **Checkpoint Signal (End of Week 3):** Are your teams responding positively to any minor adjustments? Is there evidence that productivity or morale is stable or improving under your leadership?

### **Phase 3: Week 4 - Firm Up Exit Strategy**
5. **Finalize Exit Contingencies**: Firm up your exit plan. Have a clear, detailed outline of the transition steps and key responsibilities. Identify any potential risks that could occur if you left and consider how you might mitigate them. 

6. **Prepare Your Consulting Option**: Decide if offering a consulting role is part of your exit strategy. This might allow you to exit without feeling like you're leaving the team in the lurch.

   - **Checkpoint Signal (End of Week 4):** Is your exit plan fully fleshed out, including transition plans, potential risks, and consulting options? Are you ready to deploy it if needed?

### **Phase 4: Weeks 5 & 6 - Monitor, Assess, and Prepare for the Pivot**
7. **Track Results with a Focus on Your Team**: For the next two weeks, closely monitor your team’s performance. Are your adjustments working? Is the team hitting goals? Is morale stable? Use these two weeks to gather concrete data about your team’s success under your leadership.

8. **Quietly Prepare for Knowledge Transfer**: Without formally announcing anything, start distributing ownership of key projects and knowledge among your team. This will ensure that, should you decide to leave, the team is less dependent on you day-to-day.

   - **Checkpoint Signal (End of Week 6):** Is your team functioning more independently? Are there emerging leaders who can take over responsibilities? Are you confident that your team will not suffer if you leave?

### **Phase 5: Weeks 7 & 8 - Decision Point and Final Preparation**
9. **Reassess the Situation**: By the end of week 7, take a hard look at the data you've gathered. If your team is thriving under your leadership and the results are good, you might feel more confident in continuing despite frustrations with leadership. If the situation remains untenable, be ready to implement your exit plan.

10. **Execute Exit if Needed**: If you decide the situation isn’t improving and you’ve given it your best shot, proceed with your exit strategy. Offer the consulting option (if applicable) and ensure the transition is smooth, minimizing the impact on your team.

   - **Checkpoint Signal (End of Week 8):** Are you seeing clear improvement in your team and overall work environment? If not, are you fully ready to implement your exit plan?

---

### **Key Checkpoints and Signals**
- **Week 1:** Start exit planning early. Have an initial transition plan and be ready to move if necessary.
- **Week 3:** Look for signs that your team is performing well under your leadership, regardless of input from the CEO or CTO.
- **Week 4:** Firm up your exit strategy. You should have a solid plan, including consulting options if needed, and feel ready to deploy.
- **Week 6:** Evaluate the team's independent performance. Are they ready to continue without you if needed?
- **Week 8:** Final decision point. Is your team thriving and improving, or is it time to exit?

This plan keeps the focus entirely on what you can control, while preparing for a smooth exit if the situation doesn't improve within two months.

Turn this question from the start of this thread into more of an objective problem statement for putting at the beginning of my plan doc as background: 

I am head of engineering at a small startup company. The co-founders, the CEO and CTO, are highly technical but not great people managers. (The CEO is okay app management. The CTO is terrible at it.) They both acknowledge that I am a better people manager and they highly value that that is something I bring to the organization and that it needs. I've gotten both directed and direct feedback that they highly respect me. Still, they frequently both give me feedback that are variations of me being not harsh enough. As a people manager. They say that I coddle people or that I need to push people to be more tough on their team. The problem being chad, while I cannot prove they're wrong, from a results perspective, all of the evidence is on the side of my approach. As is the management literature. So I am considering quitting because I am tired of constantly having people who are clearly less skilled than I am, so I can guess my judgments. I want them to get out of my way and let me do my job., but chad doesn't seem to be working. The problem is, I'm pretty critical to the company. I'm pretty certain that if I left, the engineering organization, possibly the whole end product and design or would fall apart. Our relationships with the go to market team would deteriorate. And probably there would be other attrition that is both directly attributable to my leaving and indirectly attributable as part of things going wrong. So, how do I quit in these circumstances? I do feel a sense of moral obligation towards the people. Not towards the CEO and the CTO, but towards all of the individuals who are working so hard to try to make this company successful.

### Problem Statement

As the Head of Engineering at a small startup, I face ongoing challenges with the company’s leadership, specifically the co-founders, the CEO and CTO, who are highly technical but lack strong people management skills. While the CEO is moderately capable at managing some aspects of the company, the CTO struggles significantly in this area. Both co-founders have expressed that they highly value my people management skills and acknowledge that these are critical to the organization’s success. I have received direct and indirect feedback that they respect my leadership; however, they frequently criticize me for not being "harsh enough" in my approach. They perceive my management style as too lenient, suggesting that I should push people harder. Despite these criticisms, my leadership approach has consistently delivered results, and management literature supports this style.

This ongoing second-guessing and criticism, especially from leaders less experienced in people management, has left me frustrated and undermined. I am considering leaving the company due to this dynamic. However, I recognize that my departure would likely have serious consequences for the organization. The engineering department, along with product, design, and go-to-market teams, relies heavily on my leadership. If I were to leave, it could cause significant disruption, deteriorate cross-team relationships, and potentially lead to further attrition. While I do not feel an obligation to the CEO or CTO, I feel a strong sense of responsibility to the individuals on my team and across the company who are working hard to make the organization successful. 

The challenge is determining how to navigate this situation in a way that allows me to continue leading effectively while being prepared to exit smoothly if these conditions do not improve.

### Problem Statement

As Head of Engineering at a small startup, I face ongoing challenges with the co-founders, the CEO and CTO, who are highly technical but lack strong people management skills. Despite valuing my leadership and acknowledging its importance to the company, they frequently criticize me for not being "harsh enough" with my team. Although my approach is supported by results and management literature, their persistent second-guessing has led to frustration.

I am considering leaving due to this dynamic, but my departure could significantly disrupt the engineering organization and other teams. I feel a strong sense of responsibility to my colleagues, who rely on my leadership for success, making this decision complex. The challenge is finding a path to lead effectively while preparing for a smooth exit if the situation doesn’t improve.
