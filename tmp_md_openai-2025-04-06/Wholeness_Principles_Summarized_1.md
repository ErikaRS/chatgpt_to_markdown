Christopher Alexander, an architect and design theorist, outlined 15 principles of wholeness in his book "The Nature of Order." These principles aim to describe the fundamental qualities that contribute to the sense of wholeness and life in any design, whether it is a building, a landscape, or an object. Here are the principles:

1. **Levels of Scale**: The design has multiple levels of scale, from small details to large forms.
2. **Strong Centers**: The presence of strong and defined centers that draw attention.
3. **Boundaries**: Clear and strong boundaries that enhance the integrity of centers.
4. **Alternating Repetition**: Patterns that alternate in a regular, rhythmic manner.
5. **Positive Space**: Every part of the design is well-shaped and contributes to the whole.
6. **Good Shape**: Forms are intrinsically pleasing and harmonious.
7. **Local Symmetries**: Symmetries that occur locally within the design, contributing to its coherence.
8. **Deep Interlock and Ambiguity**: Elements interlock deeply and sometimes ambiguously, creating a sense of complexity and depth.
9. **Contrast**: Effective use of contrast to highlight differences and create interest.
10. **Gradients**: Smooth transitions and gradients that guide the eye and create a sense of flow.
11. **Roughness**: A degree of roughness or imperfection that adds character and uniqueness.
12. **Echoes**: Repetitions of similar elements or themes that create harmony and coherence.
13. **The Void**: Use of empty space to balance and enhance the filled spaces.
14. **Simplicity and Inner Calm**: Simplicity that evokes a sense of peace and calm.
15. **Not-Separateness**: The design feels interconnected and whole, with no part feeling isolated from the rest.

These principles collectively aim to create environments that feel alive, harmonious, and whole.

Using the principles of wholeness generate a picture of a mermaid and a bunny. The mermaid should have purple hair, a crown, and a ponytail. The bunny should have brown fur and be a bunny mermaid. Show them in their castle

  "prompt": "A detailed illustration of a whimsical underwater castle. The castle has intricate, organic shapes with flowing lines and various scales of detail. In front of the castle stands a mermaid with purple hair styled in a ponytail, wearing a crown. Beside her is a bunny with brown fur that is also a mermaid, featuring a mermaid tail. The scene is harmonious, with strong centers, clear boundaries, and alternating repetitions in the architecture and patterns of the castle. The overall composition is balanced with positive space, good shapes, local symmetries, and deep interlocks. There are contrasts in colors and textures, smooth gradients in the water and light, and a sense of roughness that adds character. The design includes echoes of similar elements and a void that balances the filled spaces, evoking simplicity, inner calm, and interconnectedness."
