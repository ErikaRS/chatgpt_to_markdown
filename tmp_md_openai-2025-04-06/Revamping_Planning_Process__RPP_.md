Make this shorter and clearer without losing any of the details. Keep the casual tone.

Okay, I think this thread is the superset of the various DMs about launches that are going on. (Including the in person conversation @Raman Sharma and I had today!)

Here are some thoughts, in no particular order:
How often we have marketing moments is a marketing question, but one really insightful thing @Raman Sharma observed today is that not all marketing moments need to be product launch moments. And often the non-product launch moments can be higher impact. 
No matter how often we have marketing moments, I do think it is important to have a set of core commitments for that marketing moment that are planned out in advance. I don't think we can move to a world where teams all plan independently and hope to have a coherent launch.
However, I'd love to switch around how we think about planning a bit (a lot of the credit for this line of thinking goes to @Raman Sharma but this is my interpretation of our conversation, so don't hold him liable for my words :wink:):
Today: we plan teams to capacity (and beyond) and then plan all of that into the marketing moment. As @Aimee Menne has pointed out, this inevitably leads to scope cut. As a result, we end up shipping a large number of slightly disappointing things instead of a smaller number of coherent, high quality things.
In Erika's future: 
We lean on the "product focused" part of PFP and we only centrally plan far in advance the core of the product / marketing message we want to be in the next release. We keep that work tightly focused on the message we want for that release. 
To ensure that we are derisking those core commitments, they should take up no more than, say, 50% of a team's capacity. This way, if (when) the scope grows, we won't compromise on quality there. Note that the goal isn't to plan up to that 50%. The goal is to plan to the marketing message. The percentage is an upper bound, not a target. 
The rest of the team's capacity (which, in practice, will be smaller than predicted) is not part of the PFP planning process. Instead, teams will use a more continuous / agile (little-a) process of choosing the next most important thing, finishing that, and then revisiting the priorities. 
Note that this does not mean letting eng go wild and crazy and set priorities. Product would have a strong say in the team's priority and work with eng to plan that work. Rather, the difference would be there would not be a synchronized process for deciding work. 
Changes are released to customers are they are ready. They are not blocked on the marketing moments. Teams will be responsible for ensuring that all of the cross-functional parters have what they need in terms of enablement and documentation when the change is released. 
This is not a proposal that we throw away PFP! It's keeping the PFP process but only focusing it on the marketing moments that justify the overhead of a synchronized process.

Alright, this thread combines our various DMs and discussions about launches, including my chat with Raman Sharma today.

Key points:
1. Raman observed that not every marketing moment needs to be a product launch. Non-product launch moments can often be more impactful.
2. Regardless of the frequency of marketing moments, it's crucial to pre-plan core commitments for each. We can't rely on teams planning independently for a cohesive launch.
3. Rethinking planning: Currently, we overload teams, leading to cut scopes and subpar deliveries. Instead, we should focus on the core product/marketing message for each release, using only about 50% of a team's capacity. This approach avoids compromising quality if the scope expands. The remaining capacity should be used for agile, priority-based tasks, not for synchronized planning. 
4. Changes should be released as they're ready, not held back for marketing moments. Teams must ensure all cross-functional partners are prepared with necessary enablement and documentation.
5. This isn't about discarding PFP, but refining it to focus on significant marketing moments that warrant the detailed planning process.
