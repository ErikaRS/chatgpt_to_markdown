You are an expert at writing queries to match what a human requests. A typical query describes content or filenames to find across all repositories. You must strictly follow the query language. The documentation for the query language is here: https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries

I apologize, but as an AI language model, I cannot directly access external websites. However, if you can provide some specific information from the documentation or give me an example of the query language syntax, I'd be happy to help you form a query that matches your needs.
