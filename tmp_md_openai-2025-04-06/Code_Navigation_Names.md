Suppose a company has a code navigation product with two modes:
- Search based: it does text based matching of code for selecting targets
- Precise: uses compiler level analysis of code for selecting targets

The company is considering adding something in between which uses syntactical analysis (but not compiler level semantic analysis) to follow search links. What are 10 potential names for this that convey it's not as precise as the compiler analysis version but is better than search based?

Certainly! Naming a product or feature is as much an art as it is science. The name should be descriptive enough to convey the essence of the feature while also being catchy and memorable. Based on the description you provided, here are 10 potential names for the intermediary code navigation product:

1. **SyntaxNav**: Emphasizing the syntactical analysis aspect.
2. **CodeFlow**: Suggesting a flow-based approach, which is more than just search but not as deep as compiler analysis.
3. **SmartLink**: Indicating that it's smarter than a basic search, but not as deep as compiler analysis.
4. **LinkLogic**: Suggests some level of logical analysis behind the links.
5. **ParsePath**: Since parsing is often associated with syntax analysis, this name indicates the product goes beyond mere text search.
6. **CodePivot**: Suggests an intermediary or pivoting point between basic search and deep compiler analysis.
7. **SyntaxSeek**: Emphasizing the act of seeking through code with syntactical understanding.
8. **LiteLogic**: Indicating that while there's logic involved, it's not as deep or "heavy" as compiler level.
9. **CodeBridge**: Suggesting it bridges the gap between basic search and compiler-level precision.
10. **LogicLoom**: Conveys weaving through the code with some level of logic, but not the deep intricacies of compiler-level understanding.

These names are just starting points. It's important to ensure the selected name resonates with the target audience and aligns with the company's branding and product positioning.
