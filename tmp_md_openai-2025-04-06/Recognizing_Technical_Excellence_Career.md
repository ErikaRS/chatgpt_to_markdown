The following method is too wordy. Make it more concise while keeping the voice of the original:

I happened to be chatting with @teej a bit about this topic this morning, and he inspired me to think about recognition and improving platform and infrastructure, tech debt, etc. (@teej can also speak for himself. I'm not summarizing what he said, but more sharing my thoughts that came out of what he said.)

@teej gave an example that really struck me: right now our IC5/IC6 ladder is really focused on more collaborative and leadership styles of having larger scoped impact. What we don't have clearly defined is how to recognize via our career ladder really deep individual technical impact. 

This isn't about just recognizing pure technical expertise. As @teej himself noted, the expertise needs to be valuable to the company and applied in such a way as to have impact. Rather, what I heard @teej saying is that we don't have a career path for someone who can take technically complex, critically important parts of our stack and just make them work really really well as pieces of technology.

And I agree that this sort of work should be recognized and have an aligned career path. Not, to repeat myself somewhat, promoting someone based on having a narrow and specialized expertise that others don't. But rather, have a career path that allows growth through impactful technical excellence.

Now, there's a separate question of whether or not our tech stack today has pieces that are of IC5/IC6 technical complexity purely as technical components. However, the key question for me is, do we see that sort of less leadership focused technical excellence as a viable path to IC5 and IC6 should the need arise?

Thoughts?

After discussing with @teej this morning, I was inspired to reflect on recognizing technical excellence within our platform and infrastructure. While our IC5/IC6 ladder emphasizes leadership and collaboration, it lacks clear recognition for profound individual technical impact. 

@teej highlighted that this isn't merely about technical expertise; it's about applying that expertise in meaningful ways for the company. We need a career path for those who excel at optimizing vital, technically complex parts of our stack. 

I concur that impactful technical excellence deserves recognition and a corresponding career path. It's not about promoting niche expertise but recognizing growth through meaningful technical contribution.

A related question is whether our current tech stack possesses IC5/IC6 level technical components. More importantly, should we view non-leadership-focused technical excellence as a route to IC5 and IC6?

Thoughts?

Now again, but simplify the language a bit. 

### Assistant - 2023-10-11 10:10:56

I talked with @teej today and it got me thinking. Our IC5/IC6 career path highlights leadership, but what about deep technical skills? 

@teej pointed out that it's not just about having technical know-how; it's about using that knowledge in ways that help the company. We need a way to promote people who are great at fine-tuning the important, tricky parts of our tech.

I agree. We should have a path for those who shine technically, not just for having rare skills, but for making a big impact with them.

Do we have tech parts that match this IC5/IC6 complexity? And should we see top-tier technical skills, without the leadership aspect, as a way to get to IC5 and IC6?

What do you think?

We want to define a staff engineer career ladder definition. We want to set a high bar, but we also need to acknowledge that we have some teams where, e.g., 3/9 people are staff engineers. The current definition is below. The line in question is "You set the technical direction for your organization and influence the company’s overall technical direction." The objection is that it isn't realistic for all the staff engineers to be setting direction all of the time. So how can we set the expectation that staff engineers should be able to set technical direction at the organizational level without setting up a situation where someone is not meeting expectations if they aren't _always_ setting direction.

Current definition: 
- Impact: You drive and deliver top-level company initiatives with only broad strategic guidance. 
- Proficiency: You set the technical direction for your organization and influence the company’s overall technical direction. You use your world-class domain expertise to deliver important differentiators for the company. Your solutions provide examples for others to follow. 
- Execution: You bring conviction about what problems we should solve. You actively identify and implement ways that engineering can help advance business goals. You drive external alignment when it helps to advance our business goals.
- Teamwork: Your expertise is recognized across the company, and you actively share your insights, upleveling those around you. You work with Engineering and Product leadership to ensure alignment between engineering and business goals. You identify the right project owners and facilitate smooth handoffs.

To address the concern, we can rephrase the line to emphasize the capability and readiness to set the technical direction rather than the constant act of doing so. Here's a revised definition that reflects this sentiment:

- **Impact:** You are instrumental in driving and achieving top-tier company initiatives with overarching strategic guidance.
  
- **Proficiency:** You have the capability and expertise to shape the technical direction for your organization and provide input to the company’s overall technical strategy. While you may not always be the one setting the direction, you're equipped to do so when needed. Your profound domain knowledge is a key differentiator for the company, and your solutions serve as benchmarks for others.
  
- **Execution:** With a clear vision of the bigger picture, you're passionate about addressing the right challenges. You proactively pinpoint and execute strategies where engineering can bolster business objectives. When beneficial for our business, you take the lead in ensuring external alignment.
  
- **Teamwork:** Recognized across the company for your expertise, you're proactive in disseminating your insights, elevating the expertise of your peers. Collaborating closely with Engineering and Product leadership, you ensure a cohesive vision between engineering outcomes and business aspirations. You're adept at pinpointing the right individuals for projects and ensuring seamless transitions.

The revised "Proficiency" section captures the essence of a staff engineer's capability to set direction without implying they must always be the ones doing it. This gives room for multiple staff engineers in an organization without diluting the role's significance.

I don't like "You have the capability and expertise to..." because how do you evaluate whether or not someone has capability and expertise? Can you rephrase this in a way that focuses on actions rather than internal state?

### Assistant - 2023-10-12 09:15:32

Absolutely, focusing on tangible actions and outcomes can make the definition more measurable. Here's a rephrased version:

- **Impact:** You consistently play a pivotal role in driving and realizing top-tier company initiatives, operating with broad strategic guidance.
  
- **Proficiency:** While not always the one steering, when you set the technical direction, it profoundly influences your organization and contributes to the company’s overarching technical strategy. Your domain knowledge consistently results in key differentiators for the company, and your solutions act as guiding posts for others.
  
- **Execution:** With an astute understanding of priorities, you champion addressing the most pressing challenges. You're often the one identifying and championing engineering strategies that further business objectives and ensuring alignment with external stakeholders when it aligns with our business goals.
  
- **Teamwork:** Your expertise is a known entity across the company. You regularly share insights, fostering growth in those around you. You work in tandem with Engineering and Product leadership to ensure engineering efforts mirror business objectives and are skilled at identifying and facilitating project ownership transitions.

In the "Proficiency" section, the emphasis is now on the tangible influence and contributions of the staff engineer when they take the lead in setting direction.
