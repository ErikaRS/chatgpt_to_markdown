The request: 
Hi Erika! Rafal G will be receiving the Q3 Impact Award for Engineering (will be announced at Q4 kickoff next week :tada:).  Can you please share a personalized message you want us to include with his physical award by EOD tomorrow please. It only needs to be a few sentences. Thank you!

The text from the nominations:
Nomination 1:
Rafal was instrumental in coming up with both short term and long term plans to mitigate Cody abuse. More context: https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/CDVGH9RDF/p1694191708043389
Preventing abuse is a key part of keeping our services available to our users. It was a team success where Rafal played an instrumental role.
Values: Dev love, Win together

Nomination 2:
Rafal G is probably the best engineer I've ever worked with, from his technical skills to his ability to distill and communicate problems. This quarter he was imperative in ensuring the Cloud team was successful, worked on Managed embeddings and was crucial during the Cancun Security Incident.
Values:High agency, Win together, Direct & transparent

Nomination 3:
Rafal has been very proactive and taking over the responsibility of an area with lots of unknowns: Cody infrastructure. I saw his engagement all over the place and he is making sure we can deliver a great product and he doesn’t shy back even from the largest of efforts (like when we are discussing hosting our own inference backends).
Values: High agency, Win together, Direct & transparent

### Assistant - 2023-11-02 14:54:59

Certainly! Here's a personalized message for Rafal G's award:

Please ensure that "Erika" is the appropriate signatory for this message, and adjust accordingly if not.

### User - 2023-11-02 14:56:25

This will also be shared with the company, so make it third person ("Rafal") instead of second person ("you"). Also, if you could make it a little shorter, that would be great.

### Assistant - 2023-11-02 14:56:32

Absolutely, here's a revised and shorter version:

---

We are thrilled to announce Rafal G as the recipient of the Q3 Impact Award for Engineering. Rafal has demonstrated exceptional skill and foresight in mitigating Cody abuse, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and availability of our services. His instrumental contributions during the Cancun Security Incident and his leadership in the Cloud team reflect his commitment to our core values of Dev Love, High Agency, and Winning Together with Direct and Transparent communication. Rafal's proactive approach to tackling the complexities of our infrastructure is a testament to his outstanding capabilities. Congratulations, Rafal, for setting a remarkable standard of engineering excellence!

---

Feel free to adjust as needed!

### User - 2023-11-02 14:56:48

Change that version back to second person.

### Assistant - 2023-11-02 14:56:52

Certainly! Here’s the message tailored to address Rafal directly:

---

Rafal, your exceptional talent and foresight in engineering have earned you the Q3 Impact Award. Your instrumental role in mitigating Cody abuse and your decisive contributions during the Cancun Security Incident exemplify our values of Dev Love, High Agency, and Winning Together with transparency. Your proactive stewardship of the Cody infrastructure has set a remarkable standard of excellence. Congratulations, Rafal, on an achievement that speaks volumes of your impact and dedication to our mission.

---

### User - 2023-11-02 14:57:37

Remove the "have earned you the Q3 impact award". That part will be communicated elsewhere  with the award.

### Assistant - 2023-11-02 14:57:40

---

Rafal, your exceptional talent and foresight in engineering are clear to all. Your instrumental role in mitigating Cody abuse and decisive contributions during the Cancun Security Incident are a true embodiment of our values: Dev Love, High Agency, and Winning Together with transparency. Your proactive stewardship of the Cody infrastructure sets a remarkable standard of excellence. Congratulations, Rafal, on an outstanding quarter that has made a significant impact on our team and mission.

---

### User - 2023-11-02 15:03:22

Here's a revised version. Give feedback on it, making sure it hits the right tone of friendly and congratulatory without seeming too cloying or corporate. 

### Assistant - 2023-11-02 15:03:24

Certainly! Please provide the revised version you'd like feedback on, and I'll be happy to give you my thoughts on the tone and any adjustments that might be beneficial.

### User - 2023-11-02 15:03:30

Rafal, thank you! Your talent and foresight in engineering and your embodiment of our values provides huge value to your peers and to Sourcegraph. Your proactive stewardship of the Cody infrastructure sets a remarkable standard of excellence. You played an instrumental role in mitigating Cody abuse during and after the Cancun security incident. Your work consistently demonstrates the fine balance between near term needs and long term sustainability. Congratulations, Rafal, on an outstanding quarter!

### Assistant - 2023-11-02 15:03:38

The revised message strikes a very good balance between being friendly and congratulatory. It feels personal and appreciative, highlighting Rafal's specific contributions without veering into overly corporate language. The use of "thank you" at the beginning is a nice, warm touch that sets the right tone for the recognition.

If there's any suggestion to make, it might be to include a brief mention or nod to the collective effort and Rafal's role within the team to further emphasize the "Win together" value. For example:

"Rafal, thank you! Your talent and foresight in engineering not only shine on their own but also elevate our entire team at Sourcegraph. Your embodiment of our values through proactive stewardship of the Cody infrastructure sets a remarkable standard of excellence. You played an instrumental role in mitigating Cody abuse, showcasing your commitment to both immediate solutions and long-term sustainability during and after the Cancun security incident. Your work consistently exemplifies the fine balance we strive for. Congratulations, Rafal, on an outstanding quarter and for being a driving force in our collective success!"

This version maintains the friendly and congratulatory tone, while also reinforcing the team-oriented aspect of the award.

### User - 2023-11-02 15:05:53

Here's another version. I feel like it has too many superlatives (which makes it sound a bit fake). Suggest some that can be removed.

Rafal, thank you! Your talent and foresight in engineering provides huge value to your peers and to Sourcegraph. Your application of our values (your peers mentioned all of them!) elevates our entire team. Your proactive stewardship of the Cody infrastructure sets a remarkable standard of excellence. You played an instrumental role in mitigating Cody abuse during and after the Cancun security incident. Your work consistently demonstrates the fine balance between near term needs and long term sustainability. Congratulations, Rafal, on an outstanding quarter!

### Assistant - 2023-11-02 15:06:00

You're right that too many superlatives can diminish the perceived sincerity of the message. It's often more impactful to use them sparingly. Here's a revised version with a few superlatives removed for a more genuine tone:

---

Rafal, thank you! Your engineering foresight and talent are of great value to your peers and to Sourcegraph. The way you embody our values inspires our team every day. Your stewardship of the Cody infrastructure has been crucial, especially in how you addressed Cody abuse in the wake of the Cancun security incident. Your approach balances the immediate needs with our long-term vision. Congratulations on a truly impressive quarter!

---

This version maintains an appreciative and congratulatory tone, while sounding more grounded and sincere.

### User - 2023-11-06 15:54:51

Okay, update time! The scope of the award has changed slightly. Before, it was a general award for the engineer with the most recognized impact in the last quarter. Now it's specifically focused on Rafal's demonstration of the "direct and transparent" value. Please update the statement below to more clearly reflect that scope:

Rafal, thank you! Your engineering talent and foresight are of great value to your peers and to Sourcegraph. The way you embody our values elevates our entire team (your peers mentioned all of the values!). Your proactive stewardship of the Cody infrastructure sets a high standard of excellence. You played an instrumental role in mitigating Cody abuse during and after the Cancun security incident. Your work consistently demonstrates the fine balance between near term needs and long term sustainability. Congratulations, Rafal, on an outstanding quarter!

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 15:54:59

Certainly! Emphasizing Rafal's demonstration of the "direct and transparent" value, the message can be updated as follows:

---

Rafal, thank you! Your engineering acumen and foresight bring immense value to Sourcegraph. It's your direct and transparent approach that stands out—ensuring that our team is as informed as it is inspired. This was evident in how you handled the Cody infrastructure challenges and mitigated Cody abuse, especially during the Cancun security incident. Your clear communication and honest leadership not only addressed immediate issues but also guided us towards sustainable solutions. Congratulations on an outstanding quarter that showcased the very essence of being direct and transparent!

--- 

This revision keeps the core message of gratitude and appreciation while putting a spotlight on Rafal's exceptional demonstration of directness and transparency.

### User - 2023-11-06 16:00:18

Here's another draft. It feels a bit wordy. Keep the overall structure and message and style, but make it a bit more concise. 

Rafal, thank you! Your engineering talent and foresight are of great value to your peers and to Sourcegraph. Your peers celebrated your embodiment of all of our values, with a particular emphasis on your direct and transparent approach. You don't shy away from speaking up when you see areas where we need to do work, such as in your proactive stewardship of the Cody infrastructure. You make sure everyone is aligned on where we are and what we need to do, such as your instrumental role in mitigating Cody abuse during and after the Cancun security incident. Your work consistently demonstrates value that comes from addressing challenges head on rather than letting them linger in the shadows. Congratulations, Rafal, on an outstanding quarter!

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 16:00:25

Rafal, thank you! Your engineering insight and initiative are invaluable to Sourcegraph and your colleagues. They particularly laud your direct and transparent approach—highlighting issues proactively, as with the Cody infrastructure, and aligning the team on objectives and actions, evident in your crucial role during the Cancun incident. Your work shines in tackling challenges immediately, fostering transparency over obscurity. Congratulations on an exceptional quarter, Rafal!

### User - 2023-11-06 16:07:08

Now let's do another one: Erik is getting the "Dev Love" award. Please write up a congratulatory statement similar in length and tone to the one for Rafal.

The dev love value: Dev love: Everything we do is ultimately for devs (anyone who codes). Every dollar we earn comes from devs trying, using, loving, fighting for, and sharing our product. All Sourcegraph teammates code to better understand our users and customers and to do their job better (in ways that make sense for their role). Our long-term mission is to make it so everyone codes, not just the 0.1% of the world’s population who are devs—just like universal literacy.

The nomination text from peers:
Nomination 1:
Erik joined the Source team in Q3 and came in swinging. He jumped in the deep end and helped get projects on track and across the line, such as the Distributed Rate Limiter. He's also been an absolute clean-up tornado, simplifying complex code patterns in gitserver, fixing numerous bugs in the process, and even jumpstarted the clean-up of our mess of a backlog. Truly inspiring
Values:Dev love, High agency, Win together, Direct & transparent

Nomination 2:
Erik is always friendly and willing to led an ear, but his opinion is extremely valued because it's almost always well informed. He's dived in head first into the Source team improving things left and right. For instance he's spear heading our drive to increse security with Perforce.
He's also numerous times voice concerns that other engineers have just suffered through. He mentions it always as a way to improve instead as criticism.
Erik always surfaces the right pain points and continuosly helps us improve our own tools to foster dev love from our own engineers. He's also no stranger to jumping in himself and just doing it!
Values:Dev love, High agency, Direct & transparent

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 16:07:19

Erik, congratulations on receiving the "Dev Love" award! Since joining the Source team in Q3, your impact has been nothing short of transformative. Your willingness to dive into the deep end and steer projects like the Distributed Rate Limiter to completion showcases your dedication to the developer experience. Your 'clean-up tornado' efforts in simplifying gitserver and untangling our backlog speak volumes about your commitment to clarity and efficiency.

Your well-informed insights and proactive approach to increasing security with Perforce have not only elevated the team but also improved our tools, embodying the very essence of Dev Love. By voicing concerns constructively, you’ve championed a better environment for all our engineers and have led by example in tackling issues directly.

Thank you for your continuous drive to foster an atmosphere where developers, both within and beyond Sourcegraph, can thrive. Your embodiment of High Agency, Win Together, and Direct & Transparent values is truly inspiring. Congratulations, Erik, on an outstanding quarter that has significantly advanced our mission to enable more people to code.

### User - 2023-11-06 16:08:02

Make that shorter. Compress it into one paragraph of 5-10 sentences.

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 16:08:15

Congratulations, Erik, on earning the "Dev Love" award! Your arrival at Sourcegraph brought immediate and impressive gains, from pushing the Distributed Rate Limiter over the finish line to streamlining gitserver's complex code and tackling our backlog with vigor. Your blend of friendly support and informed insights has not only enhanced security measures, like with Perforce, but also ensured our developers' voices are heard and acted upon. Your hands-on dedication to improving our tools and workflows exemplifies Dev Love in action. Well done on a truly impactful quarter!

### User - 2023-11-06 16:15:02

Critique this for brevity and clarity. Make sure it hits the right tone of friendly and congratulatory without seeming too cloying or corporate. 

Congratulations, Erik, on earning the "Dev Love" impact award! Your insightful opinions and willingness to jump in and improve things show that you deeply understand our users and our customers. Your peers expressed appreciation for your impressive work since joining the Source team and describe you as "Truly inspiring." Your expression of dev love goes beyond our customers and also shows concern for the well being of your peer developers. "Erik always surfaces the right pain points and continuously helps us improve our own tools to foster dev love from our own engineers." You voice the concerns of others in ways that focus on improvement rather than criticism.  Congratulations, Erik, on an outstanding quarter!

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 16:15:10

The message is warm and appropriately congratulatory, capturing the essence of the award well. However, it could be streamlined to enhance clarity and reduce repetition. Here's a more concise version:

---

Congratulations, Erik, on receiving the "Dev Love" award! Since joining us, your efforts to understand and improve our user experience have not gone unnoticed. Your work is described by peers as inspiring, and your impact extends beyond customer-facing features to enhancing our engineering team's well-being. By constructively voicing concerns, you've fostered a culture of continuous improvement and exemplified true Dev Love. Well done on a remarkable quarter!

---

This revised version maintains a friendly and congratulatory tone, eliminates repetition, and keeps the focus on Erik's achievements and the positive feedback from his peers.

### User - 2023-11-06 16:19:14

Critique this for brevity and clarity. Make sure it hits the right tone of friendly and congratulatory without seeming too cloying or corporate. 

Congratulations, Erik, on earning the "Dev Love" impact award! Your peers appreciate the concern you show for the wellbeing of your fellow developers. "Erik always surfaces the right pain points and continuously helps us improve our own tools to foster dev love from our own engineers." They appreciate how you raise concerns in a way that focuses on improvement rather than criticism. They see the work you've done on the Source team and describe you as "Truly inspiring." You are truly a developer's developer. Congratulations, Erik, on an outstanding quarter!

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 16:19:25

The statement is friendly and hits a congratulatory note effectively. It does well to avoid corporate jargon, but there is some repetition around the concept of peer appreciation and the use of "truly" that can be condensed. Also, directly quoting peers might not be necessary and could potentially disrupt the flow. Here’s a more streamlined version:

---

Congratulations, Erik, on receiving the "Dev Love" award! Your commitment to the well-being of our engineers has not only improved our tools but has also inspired your teammates. They value your skill in pinpointing the exact areas for enhancement and admire your constructive approach to problem-solving. Your contributions this quarter have exemplified what it means to be a developer's developer. Well done on a truly impactful quarter!

---

This version keeps the message concise, avoids repetition, and communicates the same points more directly, maintaining a friendly tone that celebrates Erik’s achievements.

### User - 2023-11-06 16:19:52

Congratulations, Erik, on earning the "Dev Love" impact award! Your peers appreciate the concern you show for the wellbeing of your fellow developers. "Erik always surfaces the right pain points and continuously helps us improve our own tools to foster dev love from our own engineers." They appreciate how you raise concerns in a way that focuses on improvement rather than criticism. They see the work you've done on the Source team and describe you as "Truly inspiring." Congratulations, Erik, on an outstanding quarter!

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 16:20:01

This message successfully conveys a sense of warmth and genuine congratulation, and the quotations provide a nice personal touch from Erik’s peers. However, there is some repetition with the phrases “Your peers appreciate” and “They appreciate,” and the closing could be more succinct to avoid the redundancy of congratulating Erik twice. Here’s a revised version:

---

Congratulations, Erik, on receiving the "Dev Love" impact award! Your knack for identifying and addressing the right challenges has been a game-changer, fostering an environment where our engineers feel supported and our tools continuously improve. Your colleagues have taken note of your constructive feedback, which always aims to uplift rather than criticize. Your work on the Source team has been described as nothing less than inspiring. Here's to an exceptional quarter!

---

This version eliminates repetitive phrases and maintains a tone that is both friendly and appreciative without being overly effusive.

### User - 2023-11-06 16:21:03

Congratulations, Erik, on earning the "Dev Love" impact award! Your peers appreciate the concern you show for the wellbeing of your fellow developers. "Erik always surfaces the right pain points and continuously helps us improve our own tools to foster dev love from our own engineers." You raise concerns in a way that focuses on improvement rather than criticism. The work you've done on the Source team was described as "Truly inspiring." You embody dev love, and our devs love you for it. Congratulations, Erik, on an outstanding quarter!

### Assistant - 2023-11-06 16:21:12

The message is nearly there; it's warm and personal, which fits the "Dev Love" theme. However, to enhance brevity and avoid the slight repetition of congratulations, you could combine the sentiment into one instance. Here's a slightly tightened version:

---

Congratulations, Erik, on earning the "Dev Love" impact award! The concern you've shown for the wellbeing of your fellow developers has not gone unnoticed. You've been pinpointing critical areas for improvement and driving positive change, always aiming to uplift rather than criticize. Your inspiring contributions to the Source team truly embody the spirit of dev love. Here's to your outstanding work this quarter!

---

This version keeps the core sentiments but streamlines the message for brevity and clarity, ensuring that the congratulatory tone remains genuine and heartfelt.
