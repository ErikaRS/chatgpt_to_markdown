That sounds wonderful! Planning a special dinner can be a great way to create a cozy atmosphere and reconnect. Let’s make it special, yet manageable so you can enjoy the moment too. Here’s an idea for a nice dinner with your husband:

### Step 1: Set the Atmosphere
- **Theme**: Choose a theme for the evening. You could go for something cozy and romantic (like a candlelit Italian bistro), or maybe something playful, like a tapas-style evening.
- **Lighting**: Use soft lighting or candles to create a warm and intimate atmosphere.
- **Music**: Pick a playlist that fits the mood—jazz, classic love songs, or even instrumental movie soundtracks can all be good options.

### Step 2: Choose the Menu
Here’s a simple but elegant three-course menu:

1. **Starter**:  
   - **Caprese Salad**: Fresh mozzarella, ripe tomatoes, and basil leaves, drizzled with balsamic glaze. This is easy to make and looks quite pretty on the plate.

2. **Main Course**:  
   - **Lemon Herb Chicken with Garlic Butter Vegetables**: Pan-seared chicken breast with a lemon herb marinade, served with sautéed seasonal vegetables (like green beans, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes) in garlic butter.
   - **Side Dish**: Light pasta (like angel hair) tossed with olive oil, garlic, and a bit of grated Parmesan.

3. **Dessert**:  
   - **Chocolate Fondue**: Serve with strawberries, banana slices, and marshmallows. It’s interactive, which makes it more fun!

### Step 3: Drinks
- **Wine**: Pair the meal with a wine you both love—maybe a crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a medium-bodied red like Pinot Noir.
- **Non-Alcoholic Option**: Sparkling water with fresh mint and lime is a nice, refreshing alternative.

### Step 4: Something Special
- **Personal Touch**: Write a short, heartfelt note about a favorite memory from your relationship and slip it under his plate or even present it before dinner. It’s a small gesture that can add extra meaning to the evening.
  
### Logistics and Prep Tips
- **Workload Split**: To keep it fun and manageable, you could split the cooking if that’s something you both enjoy. Otherwise, consider prepping the dessert earlier so you can focus on the rest.
- **Make it Interactive**: You could prepare the salad or fondue together as part of the evening—it’s an easy way to share the experience and have some laughs.

I hope this gives you a good starting point! Feel free to tell me more about your preferences, and we can tailor it even further. Do you want to add a particular dish that’s meaningful to both of you, or maybe an activity after dinner to keep the evening going?

### Extra Touches for All Themes
