In the FLUX Review, the term "lens" is used to refer to a specific perspective or framework through which information, problems, or systems can be analyzed and understood. This concept emphasizes the idea that the way we view or interpret data can significantly influence our conclusions and decisions. The newsletter often encourages readers to adopt multiple lenses to gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of complex issues, highlighting the importance of flexibility and adaptability in thought processes„Äê4‚Ä†source„Äë.

I want to write lens on the distinction between solving problems and dissolving problems, where dissolving problems is defined as getting rid of the problem completely. 

List a dozen examples that could be used to illustrate the distinction

### Assistant - 2024-08-07 13:56:44

Here are twelve examples that illustrate the distinction between solving problems and dissolving problems:

8. **Data Breaches**
   - **Solving**: Enhancing security measures and protocols.
   - **Dissolving**: Building systems with inherent data privacy and security, minimizing the risk of breaches from the ground up.

9. **Education Inequality**
   - **Solving**: Providing scholarships and targeted educational programs.
   - **Dissolving**: Overhauling the education system to ensure equal access to quality education for everyone, regardless of background.

10. **Supply Chain Disruptions**
    - **Solving**: Developing contingency plans and diversifying suppliers.
    - **Dissolving**: Creating resilient and localized supply chains that are less susceptible to global disruptions.

11. **Poverty**
    - **Solving**: Providing social welfare programs and temporary financial aid.
    - **Dissolving**: Implementing policies that ensure fair wages, job opportunities, and economic stability for all.

12. **Climate Change**
    - **Solving**: Mitigating effects through carbon offset programs and geoengineering.

Give a dozen more examples that are lighter weight, at a more personal or organizational scale

### Assistant - 2024-08-07 13:57:48

This week‚Äôs lens: **lens of email management**.

Email overload is a common problem in modern workplaces, often addressed by setting aside specific times to check and respond to emails. This method of solving the problem helps manage the influx and prevents constant disruptions, but it doesn't address the root cause.

Through the **lens of email management**, we can reframe this issue to focus on dissolving the problem entirely. By implementing efficient communication tools and protocols, we can significantly reduce the volume of unnecessary emails. For instance, using project management software or instant messaging platforms for quick updates can decrease reliance on email, streamlining communication and enhancing productivity. This approach not only mitigates the symptoms but also fosters a culture of mindful communication, ensuring that emails are used more purposefully and sparingly.

This shift in perspective can lead to more sustainable and long-term improvements, ultimately creating a more efficient and harmonious environment.

Make it a bit more general. The email example should only be used to lightly illustrate the concept, both the problem and the application of the lens. But the bulk of the content should discuss the lens itself

Introducing new ways to see the world and new tools to add to your mental arsenal.

This week‚Äôs lens: **dissolving problems**.

Often, when faced with a problem, our instinct is to find a solution that addresses the immediate issue. This approach, while effective in the short term, often leaves the underlying causes untouched, allowing the problem to reemerge in the future. The **lens of dissolving problems** invites us to consider how we can eliminate the root causes of an issue entirely, thereby preventing it from recurring.

Through this lens, we shift our focus from symptomatic relief to systemic change. For example, rather than simply managing email overload by setting aside specific times to check and respond to emails, we can implement efficient communication tools and protocols to reduce unnecessary emails. By doing so, we not only address the symptoms but also create an environment where the problem is far less likely to arise.

The **lens of dissolving problems** encourages a deeper analysis and a more proactive approach. It asks us to identify and alter the underlying structures and behaviors that give rise to issues. This might involve rethinking workflows, redesigning systems, or cultivating new habits and mindsets.

By adopting this lens, we can move from a reactive stance to a proactive one, creating lasting solutions that enhance overall efficiency and harmony. Whether in personal life or organizational settings, dissolving problems rather than merely solving them leads to more sustainable and meaningful improvements.
