What is an alternative set of terms to LTS and interim releases?

In the context of software release cycles, "LTS" stands for "Long Term Support", which usually refers to versions of software that are maintained for a longer period of time than other versions, and "Interim Releases" refer to the releases that occur between the LTS releases.

Alternative sets of terms that could be used to describe these concepts are:

For LTS:
- Stable Releases
- Major Releases
- Extended Support Releases
- Sustained Releases

For Interim Releases:
- Development Releases
- Minor Releases
- Short Term Releases
- Regular Releases

The exact terminology can vary between different software projects and communities, but the underlying concepts are the same. The specific terms used often reflect the specific policies and philosophies of the project in question.
