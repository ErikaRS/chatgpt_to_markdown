What are three things I can do today to help my 6 year old and 9 year old girls feel like they had some special time to connect with Mommy that take 15 minutes or less each?

Spending quality time with your children, even for short durations, can create memorable and meaningful moments. Here are three 15-minute activities to help your 6-year-old and 9-year-old girls feel special and connected with you:

1. **Storytelling Session**: Create a cozy space with pillows and blankets. Each of you can take turns telling a short story, either made up or from a favorite book. This encourages creativity and listening skills, and it's a warm way to bond.

2. **Mini Art Project**: Set up a quick art activity, like drawing, coloring, or making simple crafts with materials you have at home. You could all draw your favorite animal or a dream vacation spot. This not only fosters creativity but also provides a tangible memory of your time together.

3. **Dance Party**: Put on your favorite tunes and have a spontaneous dance party in your living room. This is a fun way to get moving, laugh together, and enjoy music. It's a lighthearted activity that can boost everyone's mood and energy.

These activities are not only enjoyable but also strengthen the bond you share with your daughters by focusing on shared experiences and active engagement.
