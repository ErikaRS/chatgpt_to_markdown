Beets, like many other vegetables, can sometimes taste bitter due to a variety of factors. Here are some possible reasons:

1. **Variety**: Certain varieties of beets have a naturally stronger, more earthy, or bitter flavor. For instance, red beets tend to be sweeter while golden or white beets can be more subtly flavored.

2. **Age**: As beets age, they can lose their natural sweetness and take on a more bitter flavor. Older beets are more likely to have a bitter taste than younger, fresher ones.

3. **Preparation**: How the beets are prepared can also influence their flavor. Overcooking or burning beets can cause them to become bitter. Sauteeing at too high a heat can cause this. 

4. **Soil and growing conditions**: Beets absorb a lot of minerals from the soil, which can influence their flavor. If the soil is rich in certain minerals, it can result in a more bitter taste. 

5. **Health of the plant**: Stressors such as drought, pests, disease, or insufficient nutrients can cause plants to produce more defensive compounds, some of which are bitter. 

If you find your sauteed beets to be persistently bitter, consider trying different varieties, making sure they're fresh, and adjusting your cooking method. Blanching or roasting beets, for instance, can help to bring out their natural sweetness. Adding a bit of sugar or a naturally sweet ingredient (like balsamic vinegar or orange juice) to your sauteed beets can also help to balance any bitterness.
