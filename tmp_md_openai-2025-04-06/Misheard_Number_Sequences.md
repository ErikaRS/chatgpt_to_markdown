When mishearing a sequence like "2932," common auditory confusions might arise from similar-sounding numbers or phonetic overlap. Here are several possible 4-digit sequences that might be mistaken for 2932:

1. **2923** – The order of the last two digits could be swapped.
2. **2933** – The "2" could sound like another "3" at the end.
3. **2832** – The "9" might be heard as an "8."
4. **2982** – The "3" could be misheard as an "8."
5. **2332** – The "9" might be confused with another "3."
6. **2732** – The "9" could be mistaken for a "7."
7. **2930** – The "2" might be heard as a "0" at the end.

Other factors like background noise, speaker clarity, and listener familiarity with number sequences could further influence the mishearing.
