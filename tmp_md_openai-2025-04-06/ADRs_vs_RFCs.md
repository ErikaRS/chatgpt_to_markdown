Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and Requests for Comments (RFCs) are both documents that help teams make and record decisions, but they differ significantly in purpose, usage, and context:

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### Overview:
- ADRs explicitly document **architectural decisions**, including context, rationale, and consequences.
- They function as historical records, capturing **why a particular architecture choice was made**.

### Common Structure:
- **Title**
- **Status** (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, etc.)
- **Context** (the problem and background)
- **Decision** (the chosen solution)
- **Consequences** (positive and negative impacts, including trade-offs)

### Usage Context:
- Primarily used in software engineering teams to keep track of important decisions.
- Usually internal-facing, though sometimes shared externally for transparency or open-source projects.
- Highly specific to architecture and technology decisions.

### Strengths:
- Clear documentation of the rationale behind technical decisions.
- Provides institutional memory.
- Improves clarity and transparency within a team.

### Limitations:
- Limited engagement or feedback opportunities beyond initial author or architects.
- Can become stale if not actively maintained.

## Requests for Comments (RFCs)

### Overview:
- RFCs originated in internet standards organizations (e.g., IETF), but now widely used in software companies.
- RFCs invite **discussion, input, and feedback** on a broader range of topics (architecture, processes, policies, etc.).

### Common Structure:
- **Title and summary**
- **Background and motivation**
- **Proposed changes or specification**
- **Open questions for community/team input**
- **Discussion or feedback mechanisms**

### Usage Context:
- Typically broader in scope, not limited to architecture alone.
- Often employed when seeking consensus or soliciting community/team input.
- Can be internal or external, especially common in open-source and standards communities.

### Strengths:
- Encourages active participation, debate, and refinement of ideas.
- Effective in aligning and informing stakeholders.
- Good for proposals needing widespread consensus or socialization.

### Limitations:
- Discussions can become lengthy and complex without reaching closure.
- Potential ambiguity about the final decision if not managed effectively.

## Comparison and Contrast

| Aspect                     | ADRs                                        | RFCs                                     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Document specific architectural choices.    | Invite discussion and consensus-building.|
| **Audience**               | Primarily architects/developers.            | Broader community or stakeholders.       |
| **Scope**                  | Narrow, focused on a single decision.       | Broad, covers various types of proposals.|
| **Lifecycle**              | Clearly documented decision, limited changes.| Iterative process until consensus or rejection.|
| **Engagement Model**       | Documentation after decision or proposal with limited feedback. | Active discussion, iterative feedback loop.|
| **Formalization Level**    | Structured, decision-centric documentation. | Varied; often flexible, discussion-centric.|

## When to use each:

- **Use ADRs when**:
  - You want clear, historical documentation of architecture decisions.
  - The decision-making responsibility is clear, and you want to maintain institutional knowledge.
  - Decisions are primarily technical and focused.

- **Use RFCs when**:
  - You need broad input, feedback, or consensus from a wide group of stakeholders.
  - The decision has significant implications and would benefit from broader alignment.
  - Proposals are open-ended or likely to evolve significantly before a final decision.

### Reflection prompt:
Once you've used ADRs or RFCs in practice, consider reflecting on which format was most effective for your particular context, and why. Think about how each method influenced clarity, alignment, or stakeholder engagement in your team.
