We're thinking of names for a search product that uses embeddings to do a similarity search. Bellow is my analysis of the current options. Given that analysis, what are some other options that, like semantic search, say more about the value delivered than the mechanism?

I like semantic search, personally. It tells me why this delivers value to me: it searches, but semantically instead of syntactically. 

In contrast, natural language search describes what I do (type natural language) but not what it does for me. AI search describes how we do it, but again, not what it does for me.

Based on your analysis, it sounds like you're looking for names that emphasize the value of the search experience from a user perspective rather than the underlying technical mechanism. Here are some suggestions that emphasize the value and experience:

1. **Insightful Search** – Emphasizes that the search goes beyond surface-level information and provides deeper insights.
 
2. **Contextual Quest** – Reflects the idea that the search understands the context behind queries.

3. **Relevance Seeker** – Highlights the search's ability to find the most relevant information.

4. **Meaning Match** – Focuses on finding content that matches the intended meaning of the query.

5. **Depth Finder** – Indicates that the search dives deep to understand and retrieve pertinent results.

6. **Concept Connect** – Emphasizes the connection between the user's concept or idea and the search results.

7. **Intuitive Insight** – Combines the idea of intuitiveness with gaining deeper insights from searches.

8. **True Intent Search** – Suggests that the tool understands the user's true intention behind each search.

9. **Essence Explorer** – Implies exploring the core or essence of what the user is looking for.

10. **Significance Search** – Highlights the search's ability to capture the significance or importance of a query.

Remember, the name should resonate with your target audience and effectively convey the unique selling proposition of your product. It might be useful to get feedback on these names from potential users or stakeholders before making a final decision.
