If someone feels anxiety when the kids are home because they always feel "on call" even though the kids are old enough to be reasonably independent much of the time (7 and 10), what can help them relax?

Feeling anxiety when kids are home can be challenging, especially when it feels like you're always "on call." Here are some strategies that might help:

1. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Establish specific times when you are available and when you are not. Explain these boundaries to your children so they understand when they can approach you and when they should try to handle things independently.

2. **Create a Routine**: Having a consistent daily schedule can help both you and your children know what to expect, reducing anxiety for everyone.

3. **Designate a Quiet Space**: Set up a space where you can retreat for a few moments of peace. Let your children know that when you are in this space, you need some quiet time.

4. **Encourage Independence**: Gradually encourage your children to handle more tasks on their own, appropriate to their age. This can build their confidence and reduce the number of interruptions.

5. **Practice Self-Care**: Make sure to take care of your own needs. This can include regular exercise, adequate sleep, healthy eating, and relaxation techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness.

6. **Seek Support**: Talk to a partner, friend, or therapist about your feelings. Sometimes, sharing your concerns and getting support can make a significant difference.

7. **Engage in Relaxation Activities**: Engage in activities that help you relax, such as reading, listening to music, or taking a walk. 

8. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practice mindfulness or meditation to help manage anxiety. Apps like Headspace or Calm can be useful tools.

9. **Set Realistic Expectations**: Understand that it's normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes and that it's okay not to be perfect. 

10. **Communicate with Your Kids**: Have regular conversations with your children about their day and how they can help contribute to a peaceful home environment. 

Implementing these strategies can help create a more balanced and less stressful home life.
