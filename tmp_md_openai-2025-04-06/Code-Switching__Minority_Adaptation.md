What is it called when a minority, e.g., a black person in the US, hides elements of their personality to blend in with the dominant group?

The term commonly used to describe the phenomenon you are referring to is "code-switching." Code-switching is the practice of altering one's behavior, language, or cultural expressions to adapt and fit into different social or cultural contexts. It is a strategy employed by individuals, including minorities, to navigate and assimilate within a dominant group or culture while still maintaining their own sense of identity.

Code-switching can occur in various forms, such as altering speech patterns, vocabulary, accents, or even modifying non-verbal cues and mannerisms. The motivation behind code-switching can stem from a desire to avoid discrimination, prejudice, or negative stereotyping, as well as a means to gain acceptance or assimilate into the dominant group. However, it is important to note that code-switching is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, and individuals may engage in it for a variety of reasons and to varying degrees.

Critique the piece below. The target audience is readers of a weekly newsletter for systems thinkers.

Who am I? We will each spend a lifetime answering this complicated question. Part of the answer is that our “I” is rarely singular. As Walt Whitman said, “I am large, I contain multitudes.” 

What are these aspects? Are they masks, artifices we put for others and later remove? Are they an inherent part of us? They can be both. 

"We wear the mask that grins and lies". Paul Laurence Dunbar's classic poem of racial code-switching vividly captures the reality of performative masks.  Some masks exist so we can protect ourselves by hiding what is underneath. For minorities, this can be a quite literal protection from abuse or violence. Whether they protect us from literal violence, experiences of shame, or anything in between we all have masks of protection in our wardrobe.

Other aspects are more like the facets of a gemstone. We show them to others based on circumstance. We are one person with our family. One person with this set of friends and another with that. Yet another with coworkers. No single facet is our whole self. None of them could be. However, they are not false either. They reflect a true, but limited, aspect of our personality.

If our many selves are well integrated, we are like a cut gem. Existing in three dimensions, it is impossible to see our whole selves at once. When we show one side, some facets peak through while others are completely hidden. Twisting and turning can show the whole picture but never all at once. However, when it comes to gemstones each facet matters. When we look from one angle, the light reflected from the facets we cannot see plays a critical role in making what we can see sparkle. You may not watch Fast & Furious with this set of friends or read Seeing like a State with your family, but all of our facets reflect light to make up the beautiful whole that is each of us.

When our masks are not integrated, we are like a partially cut gem. The facets don't yet reflect light through each other, but they still make up a whole. We are all imperfect gems grinding against the wheel of life to get, we hope, incrementally more sparkly. 

Other masks, like those masks of protection, are artificially placed on top of our natural facets. Left in place too long, especially when they feel inescapable, these masks may feel integrated. However, if they don't help our whole selves sparkle, then they will eventually make us less. It can take hard work — and sometimes professional help — to grind these masks away. The grinding metaphor is apt. We aren't just molding ourselves painlessly like clay. We are rubbing up against life and sometimes that hurts.

Yet there is one key advantage we have over gemstones. Unlike a piece of rock which can only be ground away, we are growing and adding new material to work with throughout our lives. Doing so is vital. If our current selves were merely refined versions of our childhood selves, we would be a smaller, less rich self than we are with all of the material of our lives, good and bad. 

The beautiful thing about our gemlike selves is that we no longer need to be too concerned about our many aspects. Our "true" self is not a separate aspect that’s hidden away from the others. Our true self is the three dimensional whole that is inseparable from the two dimensional facets that make up its surface. We can value and cherish each of these facets even as we grind them toward something better. We can even thank the obscuring masks for their role of protection —even as we wait for the day when we can grind them off to restore our full sparkle.

Overall, the piece you've shared is a thoughtful exploration of the concept of identity and the various facets that contribute to our sense of self. It delves into the notion of wearing masks or adopting different aspects of our personality based on social context, drawing parallels to gemstones with their multiple facets. The metaphorical language adds depth to the understanding of the topic, making it relatable and engaging for readers.

One aspect that stands out is the incorporation of cultural references and literary examples. The mention of Walt Whitman's quote and Paul Laurence Dunbar's poem adds credibility and richness to the piece, making it more compelling for readers who appreciate literature and poetry.

The emphasis on the importance of integration and authenticity in one's identity is a significant takeaway. By highlighting the need for masks to be well integrated and for individuals to continually work on grinding away masks that hinder their true selves, the piece encourages self-reflection and growth. It acknowledges that this process may require effort and sometimes professional help, addressing the complexities of personal development.

Additionally, the concluding message is positive and empowering. It suggests that our many facets are valuable and worthy of appreciation, and that our true selves are not separate from these aspects but rather the integrated whole. This notion encourages self-acceptance and fosters a sense of optimism for personal growth and transformation.

In terms of constructive feedback, one suggestion would be to provide a more explicit connection to systems thinking. Since the piece is intended for readers of a weekly newsletter for systems thinkers, it could be beneficial to draw a clearer link between the concept of identity, code-switching, and systems thinking. By highlighting how understanding the interplay of different aspects of one's identity can contribute to a systems-thinking mindset, the piece can more effectively resonate with the intended audience.

Overall, the piece offers a nuanced perspective on the multifaceted nature of identity and the importance of integration and authenticity. It successfully engages readers and encourages self-reflection, while incorporating literary references that add depth to the exploration. With some additional focus on systems thinking, it can be a compelling piece for the target audience of systems thinkers.
