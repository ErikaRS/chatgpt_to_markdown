Yes, there are several herbs that can help keep ants away. These herbs have strong scents that ants find repellent. Here are some common herbs known for their ant-repelling properties:

1. **Mint (Peppermint and Spearmint)**: Both types of mint have a strong scent that ants dislike. Planting mint around your home or using dried mint leaves can help deter ants.

2. **Lavender**: The smell of lavender is pleasant to humans but repulsive to ants. You can use dried lavender or lavender oil to keep ants at bay.

3. **Rosemary**: This herb not only adds flavor to your dishes but also acts as a natural ant repellent. Planting rosemary in your garden or placing sprigs in problem areas can be effective.

4. **Thyme**: Thyme has a strong aroma that ants avoid. Fresh thyme plants or dried thyme leaves can be used to repel ants.

5. **Tansy**: Although less common, tansy is known for its strong scent and can be effective in keeping ants away. However, be cautious as tansy can be toxic if ingested.

6. **Basil**: Fresh basil plants can be used to repel ants. The strong scent of basil confuses ants and disrupts their scent trails.

7. **Catnip**: This herb is highly effective against ants. Placing catnip leaves or sachets in areas where ants are a problem can help deter them.

8. **Cinnamon**: While not a herb, cinnamon is a common spice that can also repel ants. Sprinkling ground cinnamon or placing cinnamon sticks in ant-prone areas can be effective.

Using these herbs around entry points, windowsills, and other areas where ants are frequently seen can help keep them out of your home.
