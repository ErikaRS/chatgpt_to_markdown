### **2. Key Themes and Concepts**
- Your reviews systematically **break down the core ideas** presented in the book.
- You **explain technical concepts concisely**, ensuring that they are accessible even to those who may not be experts.
- You highlight **practical frameworks, methodologies, and principles** discussed in the book.

### **3. Real-World Applications**
- You assess the book’s **applicability to real-world scenarios**, particularly for practitioners in the field.
- If the book presents a new methodology or system, you discuss its **practical implementation**, including potential **challenges and limitations**.
- You often mention how the concepts **fit into existing industry trends**, such as DevOps, SRE, cloud computing, or software engineering best practices.

### **4. Strengths and Limitations**
- You maintain an **objective tone**, giving credit where it is due but also acknowledging any **weaknesses or gaps** in the book.
- If the book presents **one-size-fits-all solutions**, you caution the reader about the need for **contextual adaptation**.
- You highlight whether the book is **too theoretical or highly practical**, helping the reader understand what to expect.

### **5. Organizational Structure & Readability**
- You comment on the **clarity, organization, and readability** of the book.
- If the book is **dense or academic**, you provide insights into which sections are most valuable or which might require deeper engagement.
- If the book includes **case studies, examples, or diagrams**, you evaluate their usefulness in reinforcing key ideas.

### **6. Personal Reflection & Industry Alignment**
- You reflect on how the book’s ideas align with **your own experience and perspective** on the field.

Given my reflections, the detailed table of contents, and my highlights, draft up a summary / review. I will share the reflections and contents first and then the highlights

## Reflections
- Did I learn? Did I acquire new information? Did I grow? Did the form of my understanding change?
Yes. I learned what platform engineering is and how to think about building a platform vs infrastructure.

- Was it well written? Was it structured well, coherent, beautiful?
Yes! The mix of technical information and leadership advice was sound and well written.

- Did I enjoy it? Do I look back upon it fondly?
Very much so. It will be one I recommend. 

- Other thoughts
I came to this book because I wanted to understand the definition of Platform Engineering it espoused. However, I stayed because while this book is very technical and focused on how to do good platform engineering, it's also a high quality book on technical leadership, just what you would expect from Camile Fournier! 

Despite the focus on Platform Engineering, I would recommend this book for any engineering manager who works on backends generally or any engineering manager who is working on developer tools generally, especially if you have to often act as your own PM or TPM (estimated 75% relevant for these audiences). For individual contributor team leads, I would recommend it more strongly for those actually focused in platform engineering.

Concluding Remarks



### Assistant - 2025-02-22 11:19:40

### **Book Review: *Platform Engineering* by Camille Fournier and Ian Nowland**

#### **Overview**
*Platform Engineering* is a comprehensive guide to the emerging discipline of platform engineering, blending **technical depth with leadership insights** to define what makes great platform teams successful. While it is explicitly about platform engineering—how to design, build, and operate internal developer platforms—it also serves as an **exceptional book on technical leadership**. 



### User - 2025-02-22 11:20:40

Stop! Wait for the highlights and then draft. Here is part 1 of the highlights. There will be more.

## Highlights
### Foreword
### 1. Why Platform Engineering Is Becoming Essential
- By standardizing tools, infrastructure, and workflows, platform engineering streamlines development, fosters collaboration, and amps up efficiency among teams. It’s the backbone that ensures scalability, reliability, and security, empowering organizations to keep pace with evolving needs while maintaining top-notch performance.
- Agile brought a challenge to the operations engineering model: with one team taking on all the responsibility for making code changes and pushing for fast release cycles and the other team taking on all the frontline responsibilities when the code had problems, there was some tension. As anyone who lived through it knows, “some tension” is putting it mildly; particularly after an outage caused by something that had been “thrown over the fence,” there was usually a large amount of finger-pointing about which side was to blame.
### Preface
- This led to the creation and broad adoption of what the industry now calls DevOps. DevOps was framed as a model to integrate application development and operations activities, and it became associated as much with a culture change as a set of specific technologies or roles to adopt.
- And this is because doing platform engineering is hard! When you strip away the hype, what we think you’ll find is an evolution of organizational maturity.
- With its heavy emphasis on reliability-oriented processes and organizational responsibilities, some thought SRE was the silver bullet the industry needed to finally balance operational and development needs, enabling the creation of much more reliable systems.
  We would argue that SRE, as it was originally sold, has not been a widespread success outside of Google. The processes were too heavyweight; their success relied too much on the specific cultural capital and organizational focus that came from Google being the world’s biggest search company.
- We can’t keep hiding behind the challenges of planning to excuse our inability to execute well. If we want to be trusted to provide critical systems to other engineers, we need to care about the operational stability of those systems.
- There is no getting away from the needs of operating software. Every company that offers online software systems must have operational support for this software during applicable usage times
### I. The What and Why of Platform Engineering
- You want to limit the places where you must have dedicated operations teams (or, using the terminology introduced earlier, “split” DevOps/SRE teams) and make it as easy as possible for the developers of the software to deploy and operate it themselves, achieving the initial vision of DevOps.
- Innovation is not born from the dream, innovation is born from the struggle.
  Simon Sinek, Start with Why
- We’ve seen upgrade cycles for systems and components move from years to months, and these changes mean work for application teams who must update their glue and retest or even migrate their software in response.
- Platforms are born from the struggles of modern scaled software engineering: the incredible demands we place on teams to manage a vast ecosystem undergoing rapid change, without sacrificing the availability and performance of their applications.
- But building platforms takes significant investment. This includes the costs to build and support them, as well as the overhead associated with limiting application teams’ choices of OSS and cloud primitives.
- Platform engineering recognizes that modern engineering teams should have systems that they enjoy using, provided by teams that are responsive to them as customers and not just focused on cost reduction or their own support burden. Instead of prescribing a set of standards based on appeals to authority, platform engineering takes a customer-focused product approach that curates a small set of primitives able to meet a broad range of requirements.
- Over the past 25 years, software organizations have experienced a problem: what to do with all of the code, tools, and infrastructure that is shared among multiple teams?
- On top of reducing the number of primitives in use, platform engineering aims to go one step further and reduce the coupling “glue” to those that remain. This removes most of the application-level glue, by abstracting the primitives into systemic platform capabilities that are able to meet broader needs.
- The best have succeeded by building platforms: developing shared offerings that other engineers can comfortably build on top of. They have become experts at managing the complexity of the cloud and OSS while presenting stability to their users, and they are willing to listen to and partner with the application teams to continually evolve and meet the company’s needs.
- Most engineers don’t want to learn a whole new toolset for infrequent tasks. Infrastructure setup and provisioning are not an everyday core focus—not even for teams doing mature resiliency testing and regularly rebuilding the system from scratch.
- How system complexity has gotten worse in the era of cloud computing and OSS, leaving us in an “over-general swamp” of exposed complexity
- These centralized Terraform-writing teams became trapped in a feature shop mindset, taking in work requests and pumping them out. This meant no strong developers (the type that can change the structure of the Terraform to provide better abstractions) wanted to be part of it.
- A platform is a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge, and support that are arranged as a compelling internal product. Autonomous application teams1 can make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced coordination.
- A better path is to realize that you need to do something more coherent than offer centralized Terraform-writing support, and think about how to evolve this group of experts from a “glue” maintenance center into an engineering center that builds things—namely, a platform. This will require you to go one level deeper in understanding your customers’ needs, to develop opinions about which solutions to offer rather than just trying to make it easier for people to get access to whatever they want, and to think about what you can build that takes you beyond just the provisioning step.
- Platform engineering is the discipline of developing and operating platforms. The goal of this discipline is to manage overall system complexity in order to deliver leverage to the business. It does this by taking a curated product approach to developing platforms as software-based abstractions that serve a broad base of application developers, operating them as foundations of the business.

- Core to the value of platform engineering is the concept of leverage—meaning, the work of a few engineers on a platform team reduces the work of the greater organization. Platforms achieve leverage in two ways: making applications engineers more productive as they go about their jobs creating business value, and making the engineering organization more efficient by eliminating duplicate work across application engineering teams.
- Instead of each engineering team hiring their own DevOps and SRE engineers to support the infrastructure, a platform team can pool these experts and expand their remit to identifying broader solutions for the company. This not only supports the one-off changes but permits their expertise to be leveraged to create platforms that abstract the underlying complexity.
- We believe that it is essential to view a platform as a product. Developing platforms as compelling products means that we take a customer-centric approach when deciding on the features of a platform.
- we believe managing migrations is an important part of a platform’s value.
- With the word “product” we strive to achieve for platforms what Steve Jobs created with Apple products: against a broad range of demand for features the product is deliberately and tastefully curated, both through what it does and, more importantly, through what it leaves out.
- Reducing the diversity of OSS and cloud systems in use
  The fewer primitives you have, the less likely it is that you’ll need to do a migration because of one.
- However, we see the most acute pain today in the infrastructure and developer tooling (DevTools) spaces, and we see this driving the most demand for platform engineering. That is because these systems are the ones most closely integrated with the public cloud and OSS. These two trends have driven a lot of industry change over the last 25 years, but rather than making things uniformly better, they are increasing the ownership costs of systems over time. They make applications easier to build but harder to maintain, and the more your system grows, the slower you get—like you’re walking through a swamp.
- Encapsulating OSS and vendor systems with APIs
  While platform APIs are often imperfect at encapsulating all aspects of the OSS and vendor systems they leverage, even “good enough” APIs that abstract a lot of their implementation will allow the platform to protect its applications from needing to change when the underlying systems change.
- You might believe that the major cost of software is associated with the act of writing it. In fact, most of the cost is related to its upkeep, support, and maintenance.2
- Creating observability of platform usage
  Platforms can provide various mechanisms to standardize collection of metadata around both their own use and that of underlying OSS and vendor systems. This visibility into the dependency state of the applications using your platform should allow you to ease the burden of upgrades when those dependencies need to change.
- Between required upgrades for security patches, retesting of the software, migrations to new versions of underlying dependencies, and everything else, software costs a lot of engineering time in maintenance overhead.
- Giving ownership of OSS and cloud systems to teams with software developers
  When APIs are later shown to be imperfect, unlike traditional infrastructure organizations, platform teams have software developers who can write the nontrivial migration tooling that makes the migration transparent to most application teams.
- Rather than reducing maintenance overhead, the cloud and OSS have amplified this problem, because they provide an ever-growing layer of primitives: general-purpose building blocks that provide broad capabilities but are not integrated with one another.4 To function, they need “glue”—our term for the integration code, one-off automation, configuration, and management tools. While this glue holds everything together, it also creates stickiness, making future changes much harder.
- We believe that, for those that have succeeded, a major contributor to this success is the leverage that their platforms provide through abstracting the operational complexity of underlying dependencies.
    - Note: That have succeeded at "you build it, you own it"

While this glue holds everything together, it also creates stickiness, making future changes much harder.
- No one loves being on call. But when teams are only on call for issues caused by their own applications, we have found that a surprising number are willing to take on operational responsibility.
- In their rush to deliver, they create whatever custom glue is needed to hold everything together, and they’re rewarded with praise for shipping fast.
- When most of the underlying systems’ operational complexity is hidden behind platform abstractions, this complexity can be owned and operated by your platform team. This requires you to limit the options that you support, so that you can push the abstraction boundary upward into a core set of offerings, each handling a broad set of application use cases. It also requires that you have high operational standards within your platform team, so that application teams are comfortable relying on them.
- The problem with the swamp isn’t just the messy architecture diagram; it’s how difficult it is to change that sticky mess over time. That’s important because applications are constantly evolving, due to new features or operational requirements.
- However, the problem remains—individuals’ roles are limited by the mission of their team, and changing a team’s mission is not easy when the greater organization expects it to just do what it always has done.
- The key to avoiding this situation is to constrain how much glue there is, which aligns with the old architectural principle of “more boxes, fewer lines.”
- For infrastructure teams, balancing infrastructure capabilities with developer-centered simplicity
- abstracting over a limited set of OSS and vendor choices in an opinionated manner, specific to your organizational needs, they enable separation of concerns.
- For DevTools teams, balancing development experience with production support experience
- In sum, platforms constrain the amount of glue needed by implementing the concepts of abstraction and encapsulation and creating interfaces that protect users from underlying complexity (including the complexity of an implementation that needs to change).
- For DevOps teams, balancing optimal per-application glue with more general software to support a lot more applications
- The initial wave was realized by provisioning a lot more hardware in data centers, and this led to the growth of infrastructure engineering.
- For SRE teams, balancing reliability with other system attributes like feature agility, cost efficiency, security, and performance
- Unfortunately, those reasonable concerns have proven not just valid, but worse than feared. While the cloud promised platforms (PaaS) that would make applications independent of infrastructure, what has seen wide adoption is IaaS, which in many cases has tied applications to infrastructure even more than before.
- For SRE teams, balancing reliability with other system attributes like feature agility, cost efficiency, security, and performance
- With infrastructure as a service (IaaS), the vendor’s APIs are used to provision a virtualized computing environment with various other infrastructure primitives, which run an application more or less like it would be run on physical hosts.
- As a deliberate reset of organizational expectations, platform engineering gives you the ability to create teams that focus on building the technologies to finally clear the swamp.
- With platform as a service (PaaS), the vendor takes full ownership of operating the application’s infrastructure, which means rather than offering primitives, they offer higher-level abstractions so that the application runs in a scalable sandbox.
- That doesn’t mean you should try to cram every new idea into the platform; rather, the best path is often to let these ideas develop independently, then merge in only those that are successful and have widespread demand.
- As a result, almost all companies doing in-house software development at scale embrace IaaS to run that software, preferring to accept the added complexity of provisioning and operating their infrastructure in order to get the flexibility of choice.
- If the platform team fights against all exceptions to using their offerings, or insists that they be the ones to build all new offerings that the teams might need, they not only push their systems to be too general but also risk inhibiting healthy innovation along the way.
- The rise of the orchestration system Kubernetes is in many ways an admission that both PaaS and IaaS have failed to meet enterprise needs. It is an attempt to simplify the IaaS ecosystem by forcing applications to be “cloud native” and thus need less infrastructure-specific glue.
- So, yes, your platform should support easy experimentation and innovation within the bounds of the known, by making developers more productive and focused on the application layer. But you will not be the be-all, end-all support of innovation, and in fact, if you want to support innovation, you’ll need to let some teams go their own way for a while to prove out new ideas. Making smart choices about when to push people toward central offerings and when to let them spin out their own alternative “shadow platforms”9 is a key skill for platform engineering leaders

### 2. The Pillars of Platform Engineering
- However, for as much as it standardizes, Kubernetes has not been a complexity win. As an intermediary layer trying to support as many different types of compute configurations as possible, it is a classic “leaky” abstraction, requiring far too much detailed configuration to support each application correctly.
- The carrying power of a bridge is not the average strength of the pillars, but the strength of the weakest pillar.
  Zygmunt Bauman
- The bespoke choice that lets them quickly ship their initial launch eventually turns into a burden, as they must independently manage the maintenance costs that came with their “free, like a puppy”7 OSS choice.
- The carrying power of a bridge is not the average strength of the pillars, but the strength of the weakest pillar.
  Zygmunt Bauman
- the four pillars of platform engineering practice:
  Product
  Taking a curated product approach
  Development
  Developing software-based abstractions
  Breadth
  Serving a broad base of application developers
  Operations
  Operating as foundations for the business
- By product approach, we mean getting out of a purely technical mindset and refocusing on what your customers need from your systems, and their experience using these systems. By curated approach, we mean not just that there are specific interaction patterns and usage conventions, but that you have an opinion about what is and is not in scope for this platform and curate the offering accordingly.
- A product approach without curation leads to great customer responsiveness but no coherent strategy, turning your teams into service centers. And curation imposed without a product mindset creates rigid offerings for application teams that may not meet their actual needs.
- The most common type of curated platform layers multiple offerings together into easy-to-use workflows, sometimes described as “paved paths” (see Figure 2-1). These platforms build on top of the work that good infrastructure organizations do in curation of offerings to make these offerings work well together. Product success comes from hiding most of the complexity of these common multisystem workflows from your application teams.
- This also means saying no to outliers; this is a paved path, not a forced offering, and those with outlier needs can step off it at will.
- Railways
  The second type of curated platform looks very different from the paved path type. In this case, you have discovered a meaningful gap that is not covered by any existing product but that would fill a need for many application teams.
- But the goal of creating this type of platform isn’t just to smooth out common processes, and it often involves a major infrastructure investment to bring a specific piece of functionality into the company. We call these platforms “railways” (see Figure 2-2). Some railways we’ve built include a batch job platform, a notifications system, and a global application configuration platform.
- If you aren’t building software, you aren’t doing platform engineering.
- The most common form of platform engineering today doesn’t happen at the infrastructure or developer tooling level; it happens within larger software organizations that have multiple product lines. These product lines typically have core capabilities that are built in-house and that should be shared across all of them: billing systems are a common example. The natural thing to do is to pull these out and offer them as a platform, so that a single team can support them across multiple product lines.
- We believe that this is true of all platform engineering teams, and not just the ones responsible for platforms that were spun out of bespoke in-house systems. As a corollary, if you don’t need to write software yet, you may not be ready to embark on “platform engineering.”
- We believe that this is true of all platform engineering teams, and not just the ones responsible for platforms that were spun out of bespoke in-house systems. As a corollary, if you don’t need to write software yet, you may not be ready to embark on “platform engineering.”
- Put another way: without that abstraction, you are not creating platforms that manage complexity; you are vending infrastructure and passing all the complexity on to users.
- Some companies approach platform engineering through a strong developer experience focus, but then struggle with the operational side of things.
    - Note: this is where we are right now
- When your platform is flaky, either due to the underlying components or to your own code, you force your customers to become experts in the platform’s operation. Not only is that not providing leverage, it is doing it in the worst way possible, as the only way customers will become experts is through the reactive experience of the platform causing new operational issues.
- The last pillar of platform engineering practice is that platforms need to be operated as foundations—something rock-solid stable that application engineers can trust their business on.
- if you don’t intermingle applications and/or users in at least some of the components or deployments of your platform, it’s probably not a platform.
- When serving a broad base of users, you cannot expect them all to be experts in the underlying systems—particularly when they cross into details like security, compliance, reliability, and cost controls. In all these cases, a simple misconfiguration can turn out to be costly. Thus, an important part of building a platform is implementing guardrails, the protections and default limits that help ensure such expensive misconfigurations are highly unlikely.
- a user of the platform should be able to tell whether they’re doing something wrong or the platform is doing something wrong.
- A particular type of self-service that is less talked about but crucial for platforms is user observability. This requires building the telemetry to help developers debug their own problems throughout the full lifecycle of developing and operating applications that use the platform.
- The best platform offerings will have an easy-to-use set of defaults for novice users but will also provide the ability for power users to access the building blocks themselves when needed for more advanced activities.
- To scalably support a large set of customers, self-service is a key part of a platform offering. If every new customer onboarding requires the platform team to do manual work, or worse, requires multiple parts of the team to do manual and coordinated work, you will lose your leverage.
- In modern microservices/SOA systems, a large number of teams build software with abstractions and APIs that are called by multiple other teams. We don’t think calling all such systems “platforms” is useful. However, as usage broadens in terms of users and use cases, you need to move from just developing features to also developing capabilities that make the system cheaper, safer, and easier to use.
- The target audience for platforms is application developers—and not just one or two teams, but a broad base of teams.
- If your customers are saying that one of their biggest problems is figuring out where to go to find the right UI or documentation to use the platform, then yes, bring in an IDP. However, if that’s further down on their list of asks, then we’re happy to tell you that you can ignore standing up an IDP for now, and instead just use tools like wikis for your documentation and links to APIs. An IDP is not a requirement for building a great platform.
- arguing “look at what the shiny UI could do someday” is not going to reduce that work.
- There is nothing engineers like less than being curators.
- Other times, the platform team is forced to customize the OSS in order to meet a specific business demand. You may end up becoming contributors to or leaders of the OSS project itself as part of this customization, or you may just create a fork for your company. The ability to work within and modify the OSS code itself is part of the value-add of platform engineering.
- In some cases, OSS is very close to providing the abstractions that application engineers need, and it just requires some amount of customization to the specific problems your company faces. Sometimes these take the form of plug-ins to the OSS, and the platform team builds those plug-ins and operates the overall system.
- Thus, when it comes to complex logic, such as coordinating multiple underlying services, we much prefer putting it in the service. But we have also seen too many teams dismiss the possibility of a thicker client for reasons of architectural or operational purity, without considering the trade-offs and whether it is the best abstraction for their platform’s users.
- A follow-on to the previous section is that applications are often best served by client-side code being more complex than the “thin shims” of pure service architectures. This can take the form of thick client libraries (as in Figure 2-5) or actual executable binaries, which used to be called “daemons” and are often now called “sidecars.”
- The key test of whether full encapsulation is the right level of abstraction is to look at it through the eyes of the application engineers—by reducing the surface area and divorcing them from resources associated with the underlying OSS and vendor systems (including things like their public documentation), have you made their productivity higher, or have you just made things easier for the platform team to manage? Until you are sure of the former, it’s better to allow direct access to the underlying systems and learn from them, rather than imposing an API where your users are divorced from the wider ecosystem.
- The service and its APIs are an important part of platforms, and they’re the reason it’s essential to have software engineers involved from the start. Without them, it is very hard to create the abstractions over complexity that make things simpler for the applications and their engineers.
- the service is a major component of a platform; it implements the logic to coordinate the behavior of underlying OSS, vendor, and in-house systems, presenting abstract APIs for application systems to use
- instead of operating one system per application, you can have a central team that provides shared systems that support many applications
    - Note: This doesn't feel quite like multi tenancy to me. Maybe it is about shared instances of applications, not just about one team supporting them all.
- There are three major aspects to a platform being a foundation: taking operational responsibility for the full platform, ensuring the platform is supported, and being disciplined in operational practices.
- Platform engineering teams must operate the full platform, not just the software developed in-house (see Figure 2-8). When the other components are pushed off to customers to operate themselves, you give up a lot of your platform’s leverage.
- But against a broad base of use cases, rarely can these be implemented so well that the team can avoid a constant stream of customer questions. These questions tend to be about a combination of edge cases during onboarding and application-specific production issues, whether caused by changes in or problems with the application, the platform, or the underlying systems.
- All of this means that user support is an important part of platform engineering, not just in terms of support practices but also in terms of creating a customer empathy culture across the entire team.
- However, the bigger issue is that it is difficult to operate a system whose major functionality predominantly comes from someone else’s code—be it an OSS or vendor system, or some other in-house system. This adds a level of complexity in that unknown operational problems (the “unknown unknowns”) are a constant threat, and the only way to manage that threat is with a discipline that seeks to understand and address all anomalies early, before they cause acute pain.
- Platforms that help optimize for underlying infrastructure efficiency will become a focus.
- Machine learning requires data to make decisions, and specifically for your own platforms, the only way it will help you is if you have the instrumentation that can produce the needed data.
- To summarize, platform engineering teams should:
  Take a curated product approach, building paved paths and railways as they identify common customer needs.
  Develop software-based abstractions. These may include services, APIs, libraries, OSS customizations, and metadata integrations.
  Serve a broad base of application developers. The platform should support multiple tenants, and each tenant should have self-service capabilities, with appropriate guardrails to prevent the mistakes that come at scale.
  Operate foundational offerings, meaning applying high operational discipline and providing support for the full platform.
  If you’re doing all of these things, then you’re doing platform engineering.
- Without opinions about what’s in scope, you’ll fail to manage the overall complexity, and without a customer-centric product approach, you’ll probably build the wrong systems. If you’re not doing any software engineering, you’re just doing operations with a high level of customer empathy. If you are building for only a small set of application teams, you’re not really building a scaled platform. And without operational maturity, no one will trust your offerings.
### II. Platform Engineering Practices
- It may be hard for an egg to turn into a bird: it would be a jolly sight harder for a bird to learn to fly while remaining an egg.
  C.S. Lewis
- But we’re sure that some of you are still skeptical, wondering whether this isn’t just a rebranding of infrastructure engineering, DevOps, and SRE, where the team promises to develop customer-focused products but really just doubles down on operating a bunch of disjoint OSS and vendor systems.
### 3. How and When to Get Started
- Bad news first. You’re going to get things wrong. A lot. This process usually isn’t the story of an elegant evolution from sensible choices of stacks and tooling into a fully mature platform. You’ll both underscale and prematurely optimize. There will be evolutionary dead ends, backtracks, and disasters. What’s important here is learning from these detours and setbacks. Try not to make the same mistake twice; try to make new mistakes.
- this experience, James has learned many lessons on starting and growing startup teams, and in particular how fostering a culture of cooperation through lightweight processes, sensible automation, and collaborative decision making helps to maintain cohesion and productivity in teams as they scale.
- we talk about what it means to do platform engineering at a small startup, where it’s usually best to start by building cooperation around your shared code.
- Mandated org-wide migrations are often a massive tax on application engineering teams, both in terms of the time spent not delivering top-line features and in terms of morale, creating a feeling that application engineers are there to serve the platform’s goals, rather than vice versa.
- enable rearchitectures by ensuring they continuously deliver incremental business value.
- The best roadmaps are meaningless if delivering on them takes so much time that some customers decide they are better off standing up their own shadow platforms.
- There’s more to great platforms than stability, but without stability you will have a hard time getting your colleagues to trust your systems.
- You want a team that has software engineers who are prepared to develop lots of code, but those engineers need to have some interest in lower-level systems, a willingness to not build everything from scratch, and the ability to work on longer-running projects. As you will usually be building on top of OSS and vendor systems, you also need people who have a deep understanding of those technologies and are ready to tackle the underlying complexity that comes with infrastructure. But you don’t want everyone on your team to have this background, because building platforms is about more than operating, scaling, and supporting other people’s software.
- We’ll look at the first two stages of evolution for platforms, broadly up until an organization has (nominally) about 50 engineers:2
  Stage 1: Ad hoc—whatever works right now
  Stage 2: Somewhat managed—we’ve started to take a more principled approach
- Most initial startup engineering teams are a few folks sitting around a table (or on a video call) building a product and probing for product-market fit. The focus is on short iterations, a minimum viable product, and the quickest possible cycle time between the code being written and the product being used.
  This focus usually results in no formal processes or tooling.
- The easiest lever you have to reduce friction and get users’ eyes on your product fast is the automated continuous deployment of code. Take advantage of off-the-shelf deployment tools and stacks that require little or no configuration.
- Don’t overthink your future scaling needs; focus on simple, cost-effective solutions that work for now. If, at some point, you go from tens of users to hundreds of thousands of users, it’s a great problem to have and that’ll be the right time to think more deeply about scaling.
- At this stage, you’re always asking yourself, “Is this tool business-differentiating or core business for me?” If it’s not, outsource; get a platform or service to do it for you.
- When deciding what kind of process to implement, I like Kevin Stewart’s adaptation of Michael Pollan’s food laws:
  Use a process.
  Not too much.
  Mostly agile.
- Start with a simple ticket-based system for tracking work. Don’t be overly concerned with estimates, sprints, or the more formal aspects of (A|a)gile. Consider tracking the ratio of new feature development to support/technical debt as a signal of how much velocity your product has and the lowest level of granularity you initially need. If your team is small, you’re either shipping product or not.
- Don’t rush to create a team to do platforms. You not only likely do not have the resources to dedicate people to this mission, but you’ll also risk slowing down the rapid iteration you need.
- As your startup finds product-market fit, your team grows, and your product gains users, pressures on your engineering tools and processes increase. A larger team means more complex communication requirements, and more people interacting with your codebase means more complexity in writing, reviewing, merging, and deploying.
  In this stage, your platform’s components emerge, and your environment becomes managed. That doesn’t mean you launch a platform team. Your team likely includes a small group focusing on infrastructure and automation, some dedicated but others with additional responsibilities. These folks may form the nucleus of a future platform team, but for now, platform engineering is still a shared responsibility.
- The underlying focus of the tooling and solution choices you will make in this stage will remain: “Is this core business?” If it is not, outsource it to a platform, service, or tool that takes care of it for you.
- In this stage, you should begin to automate your local development environment. This development will probably start simply: a shell script wrapper around a container tool is a typical first pattern. However, this pattern breaks down quickly; it’s hard to manage, configuration drift occurs as your team grows, and it is frequently fragile during upgrades and updates.

- At the point of saying no to a stakeholder request, it is critical that you don’t just assume your roadmap is correct because you planned it to be correct. You need to look at the current status and value of the work.
- questions like “Why is that the case?” will lead them to more useful metrics
- To address this, we have a meeting every two weeks between the ESO and the on-call rotations. The ESO brings threads they have questions about, and the rotation brings escalations they think could be handled by the ESO in the future. The ESO also points out areas where our documentation or tooling could be improved and trends they are seeing among customers. From these discussions come action items on how to improve—for example, documenting a process so the ESO can do it themselves, or developing even better tooling that
- Or, worst of all, everything just takes too much time and costs too much to build. Even simple features take months to produce.
- Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good; even basic metrics can make a big difference in driving good product outcomes!
- If you’re going to move some support functions outside of the platform team, a tight feedback loop is critical. Otherwise, the risk of not understanding your customer’s pain increases greatly.
- Too often, platform leaders let themselves get sloppy about business impact.
- But there is no overarching concept of how these pieces join together to create a complete and well-integrated landscape for developers, and so each team builds mostly within their silo, and the overall experience remains disjointed and confusing.
- solution to both of these problems was to develop these advanced customers into a community of T2 expert engineers, so that they would become the first line of support for their peers inside their parts of the organization. These experts are uniquely able to combine an understanding of the platform with a deep knowledge of the applications. Their peers go to them first, then the ESO, and finally us.
- If you want to get to a compromise, you have to do it in terms that rise above the specifics of each case, which means you have to make your case in terms of business impact.
- Where do you want to go with all of this? What’s the long-term vision? How should these product offerings fit together? What should a developer using this platform need to care about, and what should the platform just do for them? Once you have this insight, you can start to create a product roadmap that reflects not only a vision, but a strategy for tying all these pieces together to get there.
- For Tier 0 and Tier 1 applications, we require the application team to have a 24/7 on-call rotation to match our own.
- As our many stakeholder discussions have shown us, determining the truth of “what platform work will be of highest value to the business” is generally simply not feasible, as it involves different judgments regarding the probable value of what will be built on top of it.

For these tiers, the goal is to identify and react to incidents before they’re noticed by anyone else. For the remaining tiers, it’s OK for the on-call rotation to be notified of issues by customers before we catch them
- When things are not going well, whether due to operational instability, features that aren’t being delivered, or a budget crunch that has everyone questioning investments, you need to ramp up transparency and communication until the rough patch has passed. In this case, make sure you are bringing the right information, conveyed by the appropriate owners, to your stakeholders, and supplementing any meetings with additional email/chat updates as needed.
- Where do you want to go with all of this? What’s the long-term vision? How should these product offerings fit together? What should a developer using this platform need to care about, and what should the platform just do for them? Once you have this insight, you can start to create a product roadmap that reflects not only a vision, but a strategy for tying all these pieces together to get there.
- Your priority is establishing a clear path to reliable business-hours support for the new location, which requires you to train someone either local or time zone–appropriate to provide that support.
- When these meetings work best, they help your loudest critics understand that they are actually in disagreement not only with you, but with what most of your other stakeholders want. When they go poorly, it’s often because you are attempting to solicit opinions from stakeholders on decisions that extend beyond their understanding of the trade-offs, so the meeting turns into a battle over which teams’ needs are most important
- Your customers’ needs (both immediate and longer term), in combination with engineering feasibility and cost analysis, will help you figure out which pieces you should tackle and in what approximate order. This gives you a rough plan, which you can break down into important delivery milestones and places to potentially pause and reevaluate the next steps. This is supported by impact metrics that show you whether your work is delivering what you expected it to.
- Don’t hire a succession of short-term contractors. Instead, look inside and outside the company for people with nontraditional backgrounds (e.g., in boot camps, IT, and T2 product support engineering) who seem to be “quick learners” and who want to break into platform engineering. Add them to the platform team with an expectation that their workload over the first 12 months will be heavily support-focused, but they’ll have opportunities to grow their software and systems skills in the second year.
- We can’t emphasize enough how important it is to prepare for these meetings. Get clear on:
  What you want to get out of the meeting
  What information and decisions will be presented
  How you’re going to let the participants have a voice but also keep the conversation structured (an antipattern here is presenting a slide deck for 55 minutes, leaving 5 minutes for questions at the end)
- The vision attempts to paint a picture of the essential characteristics of a better future platform. This vision may never be fully realized, but it is an aspirational starting point, and it serves to align the work in the plan.
- Before you look for a full-time hire, ask yourself if your need for a support specialist is truly permanent. Could you reduce that need over time by investing in training, documentation, or platform improvements? If the need might only be temporary, then you should find a skilled support engineer contractor to do both T1 and T2 work, while you enact the measures to allow the team to function without them.
- Product management should run the roadmap and feature interlock discussion, but engineering needs to be there to speak to other matters.
- To formulate a strategy, you need to understand what is preventing you from achieving your vision.3 Fortunately, the minute you present this to your engineering team they will immediately identify some technical challenges that need to be addressed. While engineering works through the options for tackling those challenges, product management can start to identify what will need to happen from the users’ perspective.
- That being said, if the combined operational load gets much above 50%, you are going to have trouble putting sufficient time into improving the platform.
- Because 1:1s don’t scale, you’ll need to have broader meetings as well. One of the most popular forms is the interlock meeting. In this meeting, representatives of the platform group meet with the stakeholders to discuss work in progress and get feedback. These can be held biweekly, monthly, or quarterly, depending on the stakeholder sensitivity. At the quarterly level, we have also called them customer advisory boards (CABs).
- That’s the point of not jumping straight from a vision to a plan; documenting a strategy makes such decisions clear.
- By separating the two types of operational work from each other and from development responsibilities, you improve the quality of that operational work, allow greater focus for development work, and make it easier to measure the support load.
- It’s not necessary to take down minutes of all 1:1s in a common document; in fact, doing so can come across as tracking stakeholders’ words in an act of political scorekeeping. Instead, take notes privately, and ideally email the stakeholder with the exact expectations, so they can clarify if they wish.
- Now that you have both the high-level product requirements and a technical sense of the major roadblocks, you can start to put together the goals for the next year.
- Instead, you need to break out the noncritical support duties from the on-call rotation, with a separate business-hours support rotation.
- If you are new to a leadership role in a platform team, don’t rely on your memory just because it worked in the past—write down commitments in a way that will help you remember to act on them.
- Your roadmap milestones will fill in the year. What are the rough pieces of technical work that will need to be delivered to achieve these goals? When do you think features will be delivered to your customers? Do you need to break down big features into smaller, incremental deliverables? You may know some of this now, and you may have placeholders for others depending on what happens in the first or second quarter. Write it all down and start tracking quarterly.
### 7. Planning and Delivery
- It’s not realistic to rely solely on 1:1s to get feedback, share information, and develop trusting relationships. Plenty of busy managers would rather you just get things done, broadcast information more broadly, and save their calendar for times when it is really important to talk in private. In the steady state, we recommend a quarterly 1:1 with most of your “Keep Satisfied/Keep Informed” stakeholders, and monthly 1:1s with your “Manage Closely” stakeholders.
- But when it comes to sharing your plans with the customers, we recommend limiting the timeline to only user-visible feature delivery. If users ask why a particular feature will take so long, you can share the underlying technical roadmap, but exposing too many of the internal technical milestones can leave you open to accusations of building “things that engineering thinks are cool” instead of focusing on business delivery.
- setting a baseline by documenting the current state allows you to resolve fundamental disagreements early in the process.
- The sooner you accept that your customers will rarely be satisfied, that their leaders will always bring you problems, and that your job as a platform leader is to roll with it and keep moving forward, the happier you will be in your role.
- Consider more robust testing and deployment processes for your product.
- When it comes to specifying features, the product manager needs to document the feature outcomes: why is this important to the customers, what do they need from this feature, and how does it fit into the overall vision of where you want the product to go?
- Details of the problem
  This is where you go into depth about the problem you need to solve. A classic one-pager by Leslie Lamport, “State the Problem Before Describing the Solution”, observes that outlining the problem before proposing a solution makes it easier for readers to imagine possible solutions beyond the ones proposed. Often, this step also reveals gaps in the project leads’ understanding of the problem, forcing them to gather more details and truly understand what they are proposing.
- . It’s human nature to stop noticing the absence of problems, especially when there are more improvements to be made or problems that haven’t been addressed yet.
- More robust tests and continuous integration
  Start to measure test coverage as a metric and ensure coverage grows by only merging code once there is sufficient test coverage and the tests are green
- Deciding what to build cannot be done by the product manager alone, because there are technical, budgetary, and human constraints that are understood best by engineering leadership. Together, they will turn the why into what, breaking down any what that will take longer than a month or so to implement into a few substeps.
- Overview of possible solutions
  This section should outline all reasonable options for a solution and your good-faith evaluation of their major pros and cons. It’s important to go through this step before detailing the preferred solution, to head off counterproposals of solutions you’ve already rejected.
- For any broad messaging (including the Wins and Challenges process from Chapter 7), focus hard on what message you want stakeholders to take away. While you don’t want to compromise accuracy (this will make them lose trust if they catch it), try to send that message without including extra detail. If some stakeholders ask for specific details, you’ll know which ones are important to them, and you’ll be able to tune the level of detail to that individual case.
- Feature flagging
  Hide features you are building behind flags that allow you to limit the damage if they are buggy or unstable. Remember, a feature-flagging system is very, very likely not core business for you. Follow the maxim: if it isn’t core busines
- Developing a compelling vision is hard. Breaking it down into measurable items that reflect impact and not just output is hard. Documenting feature outcomes and working with engineering to figure out what to build to achieve these outcomes is hard. But keep doing this exercise, and over time you will get the rhythms, you’ll start to get a sense of what “good” feels like, and with luck you’ll get to experience the satisfaction of dreaming big and, eventually, making it happen.
- Proposed solution and rationale
  State the solution you’ve chosen and explain the rationale for your decision, analyzing any constraints (such as time horizon) and other relevant factors.
- We have seen highly technical platform leaders try to resolve disagreements by providing the stakeholders with a bunch of engineering details to support their case. Unless the stakeholders are prepared to evaluate these details and motivated to understand this level of nuance, they are likely to be left with the impression that the leader isn’t trying to communicate with them or is just a bad communicator in general.
- You should have basic observability for your platform and workflows by now. You want to know that builds complete successfully, alert on failures, and be aware of your environment’s status and performance. To achieve this, you’ll need metrics and exception and application logging for your platform and workflows. If you don’t have these, you should start building them.
- Customer empathy is about more than appreciating that your customers have an opinion and that you are building to help them. It also means understanding their limitations and what you can realistically ask of them.
- Try to distill the top three to five factors and make an argument for why they take priority over other concerns.
- Stakeholders who are given too much information sometimes end up focusing on things that really don’t matter to them. You can create problems just by telling them things that they don’t understand but that seem like things they should care about.
- Choose a framework to help you make decisions and review changes. A good starting point is a Request for Comments (RFC)–like process, like that used by open source projects such as React, Swift, and Rust. Another option is using architectural design records (ADRs). Keep it lightweight, but any approach that considers the pros and cons of solutions, including technology, logistical, operational, and budgetary considerations, can be appropriate.
- Let’s start with the basics: you cannot just expect your customers to show up in working groups and tell you exactly what the product needs to look like. This doesn’t work because your customers are busy, because your customers are not themselves product managers who can write up detailed requirements documents for you, and because your customers might be able to describe problems they are experiencing at the moment, but they are very unlikely to do a good job of reasoning abstractly about how they might use some future system. Most people are not good at thinking at that level of abstraction, particularly about some brand-new technology they have never worked with before.
- Plan of action
  You’ll formulate a detailed plan in the next step of the planning process, but for this document, paint a picture of the implementation. What does “done” look like, and on what timelines? Lay out some early to medium-term milestones and metrics for measuring success. If they are pertinent, be sure to address nontechnical concerns like timing, staffing, and organizational impact as well.
- Other stakeholders, when drowned by minutiae in your updates, are instead going to start ignoring you. If everything is going well, that’s fine, but when things aren’t going well this overload of information contributes to a sense of mistrust from partners who may feel that you are deliberately trying to distract them from the meaningful information by sending them too much to parse.
- Moving between stages is, unfortunately, hard to plan and predict. Often, the first time you know a tool or process is at breaking point is when it breaks. One failure frequently triggers a cascade of failures. This isn’t entirely a bad thing, as it shows you what you need to invest in and when, but it can make for a chaotic and stressful environment. Accept that, no matter where you are, things will never be entirely a smooth ride.
- The work of building a usable product does not end until people are happily using the product. If you don’t have customer touchpoints throughout the cycle of building and deploying product features, and measures for whether those features are useful that go beyond what some customer group said in the design phase, you do not have a fully realized product plan.
- Once the document is written, review it with management (including product management) and lead engineers in one or more meetings to debate the merits and get buy-in.
- Providing too much transparency encourages some stakeholders to treat you like an execution arm that they control, so this can be a good way to undermine your strategy and create unnecessary second-guessing of the work your team is doing.
- As organizations grow, their practices must evolve and grow as well. That low-overhead, ad hoc cooperation around common code and tools that served everyone so well when there were 20 people using them often starts causing problems when there are significantly more. Like all straws that break the camel’s back, the actual event that forces people to confront the shortcomings is often minor.
- Are you worried you’re going to design something that will never be able to handle the complex stuff? Well, you’re just as likely to design something meant to handle the complex stuff that fails to handle everything as you are to design something meant to handle the simple stuff that needs to be reworked for the complex. So, you might as well get started on some simple stuff that works.
- Either way, the goal of these meetings is agreement that the project is worthwhile and that an action plan should be created to estimate the cost of implementation and get final approval to begin work.
- As you build your own stakeholder map, some questions to ask yourself are:
  Who has the ear of the most senior leadership?
  Which teams are considered indispensable, and which are considered nice to have? Where does my team sit on this spectrum?
  If I did everything perfectly but a stakeholder still didn’t like me very much, how much would it matter?
  Which stakeholder groups are the loudest? Of these, which are the most respected in the company?
  If my team overdelivered for this stakeholder, would it matter?
- A useful number to keep in mind is Dunbar’s number: when you have a cooperative group of between 50 and 250 people, it’s no longer possible for everyone to know all the other members. This is the point at which you need more formal processes that define owners and assign accountability.
- Unfortunately, we can’t just ask our customers what to build, but we can use them to validate our ideas by getting their feedback quickly on what we build, and making sure there is demand throughout our incremental delivery.
- On top of that, we have found a lot of value in an “action plan” document, going into a lot more detail than what was in the project proposal. Important considerations to cover are:
  Testing and acceptance criteria ... Analyzing dependencies
  What other teams will need to work on this project? Will the project need to integrate with another system? Do you have buy-in, and possibly participation, from the team that owns that system?
  The more dependencies a project has, the harder it will be to deliver. ... Estimating headcount ... Driving adoption ... Too often, project leaders assume that “if you build it, they will come.” But even for internal projects, you can seldom guarantee eager adoption if you don’t spend time with the target users and understand their needs. ... Milestones
  The best way to bring these considerations together and manage the project implementation is to state them as a series of milestones. We prefer to be highly concrete for the first 12 months, using monthly milestones that fall back to quarterly only for later stages where there is less clarity.
- But when you look at the team through the lens of stakeholder management, the most important stakeholders are unlikely to be either those who use the platforms directly or the team building the platform, but rather the senior people who may judge the delivery harshly, potentially seeing your platforms as at best an impediment to their ambitions and at worst a competitor.
- Our rule of thumb is that the number of product managers for a mature organization should sit somewhere between the number of team-level managers and managers-of-managers. The ratio for project managers should be significantly higher—there should be about 50 people on your platform team before it needs its first project manager, and ideally you’ll never go above that 1:50 ratio.
- Product managers need to consider the cost of migrations when they make product decisions, because this cost can dwarf the value of the new offering if they aren’t careful.
- Assuming they are really happy, this quadrant is an opportunity for Juan, because nudging this group into more engagement can improve his odds of surviving a battle with his ambitious peers. However, he shouldn’t spend so much time on this group that he is seen as wasting their attention on things that don’t directly concern them.
- If you bring in a product manager too soon, this will be offloaded to them, and your engineers will never have firsthand customer empathy.
- Product managers must remember that migration costs—both in terms of engineering and the user experience—can be major factors in a product’s success or failure. Sometimes, despite a painful migration, the end result is worth it—but going in without having done the analysis often results in users viewing your work as sloppy and ill-considered.
- You may be surprised that we categorized them this way, but prioritizing making your own engineering team happy over your most powerful stakeholders is a tempting bargain that we have too often seen end in tears. Senior stakeholders can tell when they are being treated with secondary importance to those they see as lower in the ranks and will absolutely use that against you if anything goes wrong
- Often the work to be done in the first year or two of a platform is straightforward problem solving through technology build-out, and the number of customer teams is small enough that your engineers and engineering managers can do lightweight informal requirements gathering.
- It would be nice if your users could adopt new offerings the minute those offerings were ready. Unfortunately, most users have a long list of things on their plate, and adopting a new tool, workflow, or system has to fit into the wider picture of all this work
- We emphasize the negative here because in our experience, most of these stakeholders are very busy people who do not get deeply engaged with the platform when things are going well and they believe it poses low risk to their own teams’ success.
- you need to have a fully staffed and working model of a platform engineering team before you start hiring product managers (PMs), and you need to wait even longer before hiring project managers.
- But most customers can take on only so much change at once, and if your change is anything less than a must-have, you are likely to experience slow adoption. This is particularly true in times of high pressure, when budgets are tight, deadlines are looming, or other fires are burning in the organization. That’s why we use the term change budget—because it needs to be budgeted in with all of the other work that is happening in the team.
- In the top-right quadrant, you have your high-power, highly interested stakeholders. These are the people you want to spend a lot of time understanding. Your powerful stakeholders are critical business leaders or those who have the support of critical business leaders. What draws their interest is the times when they not only rely on the platform in general, but have either a direct product whose delivery depends on you or a team who are unhappy with what you are delivering.
- Interview them for their skills and attitude, rather than thinking their big company knowledge has inherent value. The “design” slot of interviews can be a good place to detect this bias. If they always jump to “BigCo X technology Y” as the solution to any problem posed in the interview, without being able to consider its pros and cons, then they likely won’t be able to extend their situational reasoning within the role either.
- In our opinion, leadership needs to be realistic about how much platform and infrastructure change can be pushed into an organization in any given period.
    - Note: we can generalize that to just change
- Let’s start the conversation by using a simple and well-established model called the power-interest grid. We’ll identify the most important stakeholders by mapping them to a four-quadrant grid, as shown in Figure 10-1. Our y-axis is increasing power, and the x-axis is increasing interest.
- when you are creating your platform engineering team, be careful about hiring senior engineers and engineering managers from very big tech companies. It’s tempting to hire such people because they have seen the next order of magnitude of scale. But while they may have experience with equivalent platforms at greater scale, they probably didn’t work on the equivalent to your platform at the scale you are at today.
- Good product culture is built on relationships, conversations, rewards, focus, and a day-in, day-out willingness to stretch and question whether you’re meeting your customers where they are, rather than where you want them to be. Finding market fit can require many iterations of trial and error before you get to the root of what teams really need. And execution is as much the constant work of building and refining practices such as roadmapping as it is the work of negotiating and developing the right product management team for the organization today.
- In our experience, this doesn’t usually work out well. Instead of creating confidence, involving a project manager too early in a project creates a culture of scheduling bureaucracy, and reduces the engagement from the engineering lead and product manager. Without their input in planning, the estimates often become overly conservative and less accurate.
- What we now understand is that the problem is much more about organization size than individuals. Remember Dunbar’s number?1 At somewhere between 50 and 150 people, organizations split into mini-organizations, with diverging practices, beliefs, and priorities. This means that even with a strong company culture, you will inevitably find situations where the right decision “for the business” from your perspective might not be the right decision “for the business” from someone else’s. Stakeholder management is how we make sure our peers have an appreciation of our perspective and context so that when conflicts happen, they don’t just listen to their own team’s complaints and blame us for everything.
- Think of your job now as detangling more than rearchitecting, and make sure you are delivering incremental value throughout.
- It is hard to be deep in the day-to-day execution details of a product and thinking ahead to shape the strategy at the same time
- For these reasons, we advise you to save your project manager firepower for times where the scheduling details create major risks for the project—for example:
  The project has a firm deadline.
  The project has a large number of task dependencies.
  Your company has a culture of bureaucracy around cooperating
- Your relationship with your stakeholders doesn’t need to be a zero-sum game where you lose if they win. You want to be smart about how you approach these relationships, but don’t forget that you are all playing for the same larger team, and the goal is to win through the best business outcomes.
- You have just created a new organizational silo, and your goal should be to figure out how to maintain as much collaboration with the rest of engineering as possible. You need to deliver value quickly to develop trust, and even if you make architectural decisions that turn out in hindsight to be fully correct, your users will be skeptical until they start seeing value.
- management must at a minimum co-own the actual work plan for the teams
- Bottom-up planning is important to protect teams from devolving into operational hell, but don’t try to turn it into “one planning system to rule them all.” If even AWS can’t use it to get headcount allocation right, it’s unlikely you will do much better.
- If you want to ensure that your team has enough cover to build the platforms they need to build without getting thrashed by other leadership or engineering teams, managing stakeholder relationships is a must.
- At this point, a full migration of an established platform to a new technology may take years to fully complete. That means new technologies or architectures won’t help your in-production application teams with pressing problems. In fact, they take potential resources away from solving the problems via faster changes to the current systems.
- Our best rule of thumb is that you should feel stretched for product managers but not be starving for them; a decent estimate is usually somewhere between the number of second-line and first-line engineering managers, with Ian preferring the former and Camille closer to the latter.4
- However, we don’t recommend further merging at higher levels in an attempt to create a complete overall plan, especially for headcount purposes. After the skip manager level, you begin to lose fidelity in the information. Worse, involving more people, each with their own agenda, can make the process political.
- Product management is about building the right things for your customers; stakeholder management is about convincing their leaders you made the right choices. Sometimes it doesn’t matter how well you are delivering a rock-solid, customer-focused platform: if key stakeholders don’t believe in your investments, you will be unsuccessful.
- Given that you have delayed forming a platform team until its leverage clearly outweighs the costs of coordination, the state of the initial system will often not resemble anything like a platform.
- Be wary of letting engineers shut off their brains when it comes to their jobs, including deciding what to work on, when, and how to prioritize work. When you have too many product managers and treat your engineering teams like external contractors who just take in specs and implement them, you create all sorts of unintended downsides, cut off the creativity and ownership of a big part of the team, and generally end up with poor results.
- Thus, while it’s useful to measure and discuss, resist the urge to communicate the 70/20/10 model as a “budget” that leadership grants and teams get to spend.
- They can’t see that the growth of the platform also impacts the way they need to approach major changes. The breadth of use cases has increased, and the number of people implementing and consuming the use cases has also increased. “Five good engineers in a room” can no longer represent all perspectives, which means a lot more opinions and a lot more conflict in getting to a decision. All of this means that change is now going to be much slower.
- When your platform is having stability issues, it’s almost always better to invest engineering time into improving stability instead of adding more features or products onto an unreliable base. This might mean that you miss some of your product goals for the year, but who cares about new stuff when you can’t even reliably use the existing offerings?
- We like Google’s 70/20/10 model:
  70% on core initiatives (incremental work on current platforms)
  20% on adjacent innovation (platform rearchitectures)
  10% on transformational innovation (completely new platforms)
- The promise of platform engineering is that we can minimize the cost of change for the whole engineering organization through better automation, communication, and execution. We aspire to be a stable foundation that makes the whole organization more efficient as a result.
- in practice there is a human dimension that makes it hard for everyone to realize that it’s past time for a change. So, you’ll have customers with rose-colored glasses remembering when they could open pull requests on the platform codebase at will, and insisting that any process is just “big company ideas” brought in by problematic newcomers or “process for process’s sake.”
- This one is painful but true: both engineers and product managers mistake novelty as the most important offering their platforms can provide, and they forget that stability is often at least as important, if not more so
- Individual system improvement projects should not take longer than three developer months.
- It’s not fun to tell a stakeholder that you can’t support them anymore, but it’s worse to degrade everyone else’s experience because your team is spread too thin supporting one-off special-case offerings. So, don’t be afraid to edit your offerings from time to time when you launch something that goes almost nowhere. Doing the right thing for the overall company sometimes means disappointing a few people in the process.
- You might want to do a quick total cost of ownership estimate: if this system requires a large team to build and maintain, and it can support multiple teams without significant configuration or logic changes for each team, it’s a good candidate for solving once. But if it has a small cost to build and maintain, and especially if each application wants to configure or extend its logic, it’s probably not a great candidate for centralizing.
- for users to use the new offering they need to be able to use it to do the same things they were doing before; but to really make that effort pay off, they need to be able to do more than they were doing before. Is it easy for them to see immediate benefits once they’ve gotten used to the new tool? Will it create time savings for the users that they can reinvest into getting more done, and actually drive productivity? Think about all of these factors when you make your product roadmap, because a customer base can absorb only so much change at once.
- KTLO work should account for no more than 40% of your team’s workload.
- If you’re sunsetting something, it should already have a limited number of users, and talking to them (instead of just sending an announcement notice) is a good idea to maintain your relationships. Furthermore, while you might have an idea about the timeline for sunsetting, be prepared to negotiate that in order to give your stakeholders the chance to react.
- But sometimes companies insist on a level of standardization that doesn’t bring meaningful value and slows application teams down. Do you really have to have only one caching solution? Does every team need to use the same standardized web framework? Make sure a standard platform will bring leverage—outsized value that is hard to replicate.
- At least within your own product area, think about how much change you are really going to push through the company in a given year. Is there a way to make that change easier to adopt so your users can take on more of it without increased effort?
- Our preference for platform teams is to do “deep” from-scratch planning annually, then a lighter refresh in the other three quarters.
- Occasionally, the burden of support is beyond what your team can justify, but another team is so dependent on the system that they are willing to take it back and operate it themselves.
- When you see application teams building similar software, it’s natural to think it would be more efficient to have a centralized, common platform. However, each centralized offering creates a new coordination point for application teams, and the more coordination points they have to work through to get their products shipped, the harder their jobs become. This means your reasoning for creating a new platform offering needs to be about leverage rather than just efficiency.
- In our opinion, leadership needs to be realistic about how much platform and infrastructure change can be pushed into an organization in any given period.
    - Note: and change in general
- You should now have the following artifacts:
  A nonnegotiable estimate of KTLO work
  An estimate of all “likely nonnegotiable” mandated projects
  Your product roadmap, which lists the new things customers and stakeholders want out of your platform (this should include ideas from the platform engineering teams themselves, not just work defined by product management)
  Three stacked-rank lists of projects to improve efficiency, reliability, and security
- One of the hardest parts of this project was getting the team to realize that the new tool was going nowhere, and despite their best efforts, it wasn’t worth the continued investment. They wanted so much for the thing they had invested in to succeed that getting them to accept that the project was at a dead end was nearly as hard as getting the tool itself sunsetted and removed. In fact, we think this is one of the more common challenges that leaders have with sunsetting exercises, because while customers can be frustrated that they have to migrate or give up a feature, the teams that built that feature are often even more attached to the sunk cost they’ve put in so far. It’s never fun to tell someone to kill their darling.
- Thinking you need more or need them sooner is usually a signal to do a lot more definition of your platform’s abstractions to avoid its changes requiring so much work of its users.
    - Note: more product or project managers
- Good product culture is built on relationships, conversations, rewards, focus, and a day-in, day-out willingness to stretch and question whether you’re meeting your customers where they are, rather than where you want them to be. Finding market fit can require many iterations of trial and error before you get to the root of what teams really need. And execution is as much the constant work of building and refining practices such as roadmapping as it is the work of negotiating and developing the right product management team for the organization today.
- But building large security engineering teams doesn’t work either. While they provide great analysis of security and compliance issues and implementation trade-offs, it’s usually hard for them to make substantial changes to systems owned by other teams, particularly when those changes are design or product-level decisions. This work is best done by platform teams themselves, using the independent security engineering organization to help advocate for, compile, evaluate, and consult on projects.
- When you have an offering that requires continual engineering investment that you need to redirect elsewhere, this can be a sign that you need to sunset the offering to free up bandwidth for other things.
- Finally, as we will talk about in Chapter 4, be careful to interview for “process fit” at this point, because many product and project managers who are great working within the established guardrails of bigger companies can’t get things done without them.
- great products are always situational, stemming from deep insight into what people need, combined with an understanding of what is realistic to build.
- So, have the FinOps team lead an ongoing cost-efficiency investigation program that creates time for each team’s systems engineers to explore high-potential efficiency improvements. Then, in your bottom-up planning processes, estimate the implementation costs of the highest-value ones, stack rank them by cost/benefits, and prioritize them alongside other systems improvements.
- When you have an offering that requires continual engineering investment that you need to redirect elsewhere, this can be a sign that you need to sunset the offering to free up bandwidth for other things.
- These are trickier than pure “infrastructure” and “developer” platforms as they end up with some surface area directly visible to the external customer.
- What they do love doing is the second category of efficiency improvements: performance engineering, a system-wide approach to design, analysis, and tuning systems for performance and efficiency. When performance engineering leads to well-tuned systems, it can create the “quick wins” CTOs and finance teams love, where weeks of work produce hundreds of thousands of dollars in yearly savings. But doing this requires deep knowledge of the production platforms.
- the system runs itself, you may not care that it has low adoption, but when the support burden for a particular feature or offering is high but it has few users, that is a sign that you need to do something. If you don’t see a path to increasing adoption, you may need to sunset the offering to reduce the burden for your team.
- When you build products with business-facing surface area, business-facing product managers come with the territory. So, in these cases we advise hiring a PM much earlier—maybe as soon as the team is formed. However, you need to avoid the mistake of thinking every successful business-focused PM can successfully transition to internal platforms.
- Rare things become common at scale.

- The cloud allows you to burn cash quickly in too many ways, and you need someone guarding against that. This is a large enough problem that you need a FinOps specialist once the engineering organization gets to about 200 engineers.
  In smaller organizations, we often assign this responsibility as a part-time role to the systems engineers on our compute platform teams, because they are already close to the cloud vendors, and because compute use cases often carry the most cost complexity. But while FinOps work is complex, most systems engineers don’t enjoy it as a full-time role, because it is not “hands-on” enough in terms of production systems.
- Sunsetting should be used only at the very tail end of a migration, when you are down to a small set of customers who are deeply coupled to some feature that is not and cannot be supported by the new system.
- With the wrong product manager, this can leave engineers spending too much time “pleasing the CEO” by working on small details in the UI design and other end user interfaces while the core technology is neglected. This eventually leads not just to reliability problems, but to internal customer usability being neglected as well.
- Platforms create their value through leverage, and one aspect of leverage is efficiency—supporting substantially more scale without needing to hire more people into the platform team.
- Doing better than this requires platform teams to constantly invest in efficiency improvements. We have found this is often done poorly because a lot of people miss that the work is split into two categories: FinOps, which is done (at scale) by a team of dedicated specialists, and performance engineering, which is best done by systems engineers within each platform team, and whose larger projects should be included in planning for each team.
- In the case where you are not only asking people to move off of a platform but don’t have a near-equivalent system for them to move onto, you are not just asking for a migration; you are sunsetting a system.
- The bigger the company, the harder it is for people to realize that your team has offerings that they might need, particularly when these are semioptional systems that aren’t needed by everyone.
- To avoid this, platform teams need to routinely invest in operational practices, even when times are good.
- However, without strong leadership, such efforts can become highly bureaucratic and return little value. Seek feedback when undertaking such a task to ensure that the process will drive action, rather than create a long list that is immediately forgotten.
    - Note: a good reminder about process in general
- Mandates may be necessary to drive that final 20% of a migration effort. There may be a lot of pain in the migration, but there’s bound to be just as much pain (and even more risk) in keeping the old thing running, and sometimes the company needs a senior leader to say “we all know this is the right thing” to actually get all parties to commit to doing that right thing.
- Engineers get in their own way here by giving their internal platforms cutesy names that don’t clearly describe what they do: naming your billing platform “Glengarry” instead of “Billing Platform” does not help your discoverability problem.
- Too many leaders force processes that they’ve just read about (or worse, that they used in their last job) onto their organization, without looking at the costs and benefits for the particular set of problems the team is dealing with.
- You should also be looking at your customers’ postmortems to identify guardrails that you can build in your platform that will eliminate failures for them.
- planning migrations as part of other important work is usually more effective than annoying your customers with random unscheduled mandatory work that doesn’t seem to have any alignment with the other random unscheduled mandatory work coming at them
- Be sure you make a plan for how you will deliver awareness across the company for your offering. Start with a name that makes sense. Write documentation that is searchable on the company intranet. Send out email announcements, run learning sessions, or speak at company meetings to drive knowledge and awareness of your platform. It doesn’t matter how you decide to do it; it just matters that you do it.
- Processes are situational, and the granular details should be tailored to the unique challenges your team is facing. But practices are broad. They provide a framework and allow you to create whatever process you need to solve the specific problem you have today. As your problems change, your processes will change too. But the practice remains.
- System improvements generally fall into one of three buckets:
  Reliability and operability
  Efficiency and performance
  Security and compliance
- We advise you to save your mandate requests for the things that are essential and, if possible, align them with satisfying other mandatory efforts (or even better, align them with major product initiatives!).
- We strongly recommend having a merged DevOps on-call team that goes on rotation 24x7 to handle non-support operational issues. We realize this is not always a popular opinion, but hear us out. As we will explain, with the right management practices to ensure sustainability, we’ve seen platform teams come to prefer this approach because it gives them more control over their fate.
- KTLO doesn’t include work that falls into the category of “if the system is not improved soon, it will hurt the company in the intermediate term, by increasing either the likelihood of a problem or the scope of its negative impact.” This work arises from three general directions: ongoing growth in scale pushing the system closer to its limits, the system’s natural deterioration in a changing environment (sometimes called “software rot”), and standards rising as the platform and its applications become more important to the business.
- Either way, the better the new platform and the better the experience of those who have already migrated, the easier this debate will become, because more people will trust you and want to use the new offering. But easier is not easy, and in the case of legacy applications with minimal customer ownership, expect significant pushback on having to do this work.
- However, it also creates a problem: who are the people who can be on-call to quickly diagnose and remediate a problem that could be caused by in-house code, by one of the OSS or vendor systems, or by some interaction between them? Our answer is that only a merged team can staff an on-call rotation with the required level of expertise in a sustainable manner.
- When mandates threaten to overburden your team, tell that executive as soon as possible, so they can give feedback to the leadership team and hopefully help whittle down the list to the truly essential.
- At scale, you’ll inevitably miss some underlying dependency that will lead to a scramble during this final drawn-out stage of a major migration. Don’t panic; instead, draw on the ingenuity of your team to solve the problem, and in the meantime make sure you are communicating this risk to anyone who might care (or could help!).
- The SRE literature suggests the same thing that our experience shows, which is that few engineers will stay in a job where they are on-call over 25% of the time. So if you go the split approach, then in addition to your platform development team, you need the on-call rotation to be covered by a team of at least four or five SREs.2
- Thus, estimating the net impact of mandates means taking your best guess at which are both likely to move forward and of high impact on your team, and estimating the effort they will take. This is an art that requires some political awareness and good communication with the executive in your leadership tree who can have some sway on whether proposed mandates move forward.
- You’ll want to figure out the balance of work to put into the old system versus the new one during these final stages of migration ahead of time, so you don’t end up relying on a couple of long-serving employees to hold things together for the final months.
- But our experience is that, unless you are building FAANG-scale platforms that can justify having 10 or more engineers working on them full-time, it’s not worth the difficulties of trying to make a split system work.
- Mandates present a planning contradiction. There are inevitably mandates that are claimed to be essential at the beginning of the planning process that will be killed once the company realizes the total amount of work involved and how that will cut into other higher-value priorities. This means while no single team can just say “no” to these mandates, if you plan with the assumption that you have to do all of them, then the rest of your plan will get derailed.
- It’s natural that you would focus on the migration work that gets the most customers finished first, but this long tail can’t be ignored forever. As you start on this final set, you will inevitably discover new complications that you’ll need to resolve if you hope to complete the work.
- In our experience, a sustainable 24x7 on-call load should involve fielding fewer than five business-impacting pages a week.
- Mandates are top-down edicts, things that the executive leadership team says must be done, often with hard timelines.
- Beyond all of this, it’s helpful to have a dedicated communication and support channel during the course of the migration, separate from your normal support and on-call rotations.
- But we firmly believe that a constant demand of more than five pages a week is not sustainable. It may be supportable in the short term, while the platform is in an “exciting growth” stage and team members are willing to go above and beyond despite the impact on their work-life balance, but that lack of work-life balance will gradually lead to burnout and start having an impact on staff retention.
- You might call this “operations,” but KTLO viscerally captures an engineering team’s truly nondiscretionary operational work—the absolute essentials required to keep the business running over the next 12 months.
- Across the core platform areas, where are there known major changes coming that will require customer work?
  Have you thought about where you can bundle related changes to reduce the customers’ work, and where you might delay certain migrations due to already planned churn?
  Does your plan give you enough confidence that you can use it to communicate the major changes for the next two to three quarters, so that your customer teams can plan to absorb them?
- Annual attrition was running at about 25%, and not only was this a first-order problem in terms of human impact, but it was also leading to a knowledge loss that itself caused more operational issues.
- Avoiding this outcome requires augmenting feature delivery plans with the work needed to operate and operationally improve the platform. The next subsections describe three pools of work you’ll need to estimate. First, there’s the keep the lights on (KTLO) work: the essential operational tasks that keep systems and services running smoothly. Second, you have executive mandates, (almost) nonnegotiable projects handed down from executive leadership. Third, you have system improvements, which are exactly what they sound like: the work to improve the platform’s operations, efficiency, security, reliability, and compliance.
- For changes that also require changes at your own platform layer, you may want to hold off on communicating until you are confident that the project is closer to shipping and you know what the work involved will be—perhaps once you’ve got an alpha customer using the new version and are confident the change is what you want.
- Fewer than two pages a week correlated with happy team members.
  Two to five pages a week correlated with some unhappiness with operational load, but did not correlate with a negative response to the question “Do you see yourself on this team in 12 months?”
  More than five pages a week correlated with consistent unhappiness, and also correlated with a negative response to the question “Do you see yourself on this team in 12 months?”
- Because scaled platforms are so complex and often support business-critical applications, platform teams need to invest in operations proactively. This means not only maintaining systems, but also changing them to handle increased scale.
- These deadlines can be built into the roadmaps that you communicate to your customers, and repeated through newsletters, quarterly planning sessions, and other frequent customer engagements.
- We all know our teams would be thrilled if the on-call experience was less terrible. But how do you get there? You start by keeping your focus on the highest priority: platform stability
- However, once a team is under delivery or operational pressure, you need to invest in a second, higher-fidelity roadmap, called a bottom-up roadmap.
- The first step is to tell customers about migrations as soon as you know that they are coming (with the caveat that this should be information-only for most deadlines more than 12 months out).
- The practice is sustainable on-call, but the process to achieve that can change. The goal of five pages per week is important, but if it’s clear the team is doing well, you may only need a process to track the average number of pages a week, for example, as part of each quarter’s OKRs. Alternatively, if the team is struggling with operational hell, you will need a more rigorous process with weekly metrics reporting and actionable remediation steps. Processes are flexible; implementing some type of practice is not.
- As Cian Synnott, senior staff engineer at Datadog, told us: “I’ve often seen a new senior engineer added to a team who questions everything. That’s good, and part of team formation in a way, but being able to say ‘yeah, we’re doing this project this way and <here’s why>’ is a great way to channel their energy and keep it positive.”
- Context-free deadlines are one of the great frustrations that customers experience during migrations—but how can you avoid these deadlines, knowing that users tend to procrastinate on migration-related work until it turns into a fire drill? The answer lies in your communication strategy.
- False alarms are a big obstacle to understanding the sustainability of your on-call load.
- Projects also drag on when the team is unstable. Losing people who know about the project slows everyone down. Not only do you lose people who could have done the work, but you also then have to find new people to add to the project, train them on its details, and get them effectively gelled with the rest of the team. All of this hinders productivity. Unfortunately, team turnover is often caused by projects that are already dragging on, which leads to a vicious cycle of project delays and demoralized team members who quit or move to other projects, in turn delaying the current project even more.
- Don’t be afraid to ask questions about whether these migrations should happen at the same time, what the impact of these changes will be to other parts of the platform, and whether the plans have accounted for these overlaps.
- We find this advice from the SRE book to be our best practice as well: “In teams for which a secondary rotation is not strictly required for duty distribution, it is common for two related teams to serve as secondary on-call for each other, with fall-through handling duties. This setup eliminates the need for an exclusive secondary on-call rotation.”
- It’s critical to define the problem that your initiative is trying to solve, hypothesize a solution, provide evidence that the proposed solution can solve the problem, and (ideally) provide metrics to gauge if the solution is working
- Keep track of your major outstanding requests, and prioritize.
- Thus, it should be extraordinarily rare for incidents to fall through to the secondary team.
- When these solutions don’t work out, too often teams double down on them rather than declaring these types of investments as failures. They insist that they just need to find the right use case for their cool UI, or the right users who need exactly what the generic offering can provide. A former colleague of ours in the product engineering world used to call this behavior “sh*terating.”
- There are times when it makes sense to do a group of changes together but it’s better if the grouped changes happen internally to the platform, leaving the customer to see only one piece of work
- We understand why your instinct, as with being on call, might be to protect your platform engineers from support duties. Support is a per-user engagement and seems low-leverage compared to the code they could be developing to make the platform better for all users. However, it’s crucial for engineers to directly experience users’ problems to understand their needs and build the right features for the platform.
- Writing a concrete proposal that your customers can understand and critique is one way to make sure that you aren’t getting into this situation. If you can’t figure out how to write this document, it’s a sign that you may have bitten off more than you can chew, and the best bet might be to scope down your efforts.
- In both cases, we covered a good portion of the use cases to keep early adopters happy, and also satisfied those who wanted the full feature set because we proposed a plan and timeline for the rest. The result of this incremental delivery that allowed us to say yes to more things was the team was perceived a lot more positively.
- When platform engineers are removed from hearing from users about their problems, they forget that “user problems” are really platform problems, and so build platforms with unrealistic expectations of users.
- Sorry to be the bearers of bad news, but if you’ve promised a complete platform for all customers, you are going to have a very hard time delivering on this promise.
- As we’ve described in previous chapters, a shadow platform is a system that duplicates the function of a current platform, often using different underlying OSS and vendor technologies, with a slightly different feature set and/or system (cost, performance, reliability) profile.
- Involve all your engineers in user support. They, and your platform, will be better for it.
- It’s good to keep Gall’s law in mind when you start new platform projects:
  A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.3
- Sometimes the product team has a burning need, and they cannot get on the schedule of the platform team to get this need met. It’s true that this may be a false urgency, and the decision by the product team to build this new solution may be driven by the naive view that throwing together a new platform or supporting a new piece of infrastructure is easy and cheap, but there are also legitimately times when a business has a tight window of opportunity to capture some value and they need something that doesn’t exist yet in the platform and can’t be added quickly.
- You need to understand what those 30 support tickets really represent, which requires first categorizing them and then taking a deep dive into the problem categories.
- While building good products is hard, and building good platforms is hard, building a complex platform from scratch for a diverse user base might well be impossible.
- There will be times when an application team needs something that might fit in with the platform offerings, but is not yet on the radar for anyone else. This could happen because there is an opportunity that requires a significantly different technology capability than the rest of the company
- It can be tempting to skip this, particularly for leaders with a development background who wish it was someone else’s job—but until you are able to explain what is driving your support load, and why it is beyond your ability to get on top of it, you should expect no help from customers in trying to reduce its impact on your team.
- we discussed the challenge of getting customers to tell you what they want you to build. This in turn can lead to the team struggling to write a project proposal, because they are unwilling or unable to commit to a proposed solution that might exclude some customer group. Instead, the proposals start to look like increasingly complex design specifications meant to cover all possible eventualities.
- We have all experienced the conflict avoidance of engineers, and know that sometimes people prefer to just go off and do things on their own rather than have to negotiate with another team—especially when there is some outstanding animosity or even just ambivalence about the experience of working together.
- The fundamental questions you are trying to answer for a customer who feels (i.e., may or may not be) blocked or is seeing a production issue are:
  Can I immediately engage a platform engineer to help?
  If not, how long will I have to wait for some help?
- This failure is an example of overreach. The system rewrite was always going to be a big project, but because the team knew it would be hard, they started to believe that they should make the absolute most of the opportunity and go from “big project” to “revolutionary project.”
- There is no easy answer to solving the problem of an us versus them culture. We discussed this in Chapter 5, but the more you can do to clean up this thinking in your own team and by engaging with the leadership of other teams, the better. This will help you get earlier insight into what their needs are, incline them to consult you as a trusted advisor before they start building on their own, and make it less likely that you will be surprised by shadow infrastructure that you never knew was being built.
- To resolve this, you need to specify both the type of business impact and the conditions that make it reasonable to think paging your engineer will help mitigate the issue.
- Most engineers start long projects with a great degree of hope and optimism—if that wasn’t the case, we’d probably start far fewer multiyear projects!
### 9. Migrations and Sunsetting of Platforms
- If it seems like a genuine need that isn’t covered by your platform, it may be best to let them run with it—you might not have the bandwidth to address an urgent product engineering demand for a new platform offering, and even if the team did the right thing by coming to you first, there may be no way for you to reprioritize your current work (or hire additional headcount) to help them.
- when a system that is critical to the business goes down, it is actually a best practice for incident managers fielding operational calls to proactively page the on-calls for all dependent systems if there is the slightest suspicion they could be the cause. They are thinking in terms of mean time to recovery (MTTR), which is the right thing for the business. But if your platform is a dependency of every team at the business, and you have not given your on-call engineers and incident managers evidence to rule out your platform, your engineers will get paged constantly, even when their system isn’t the cause of the incident.
- Sometimes a team is going to build something no matter what, and the best thing you can do is watch and wait.
- A strong culture of follow-through on postmortem remediation items—in particular, those that answer the question “Why did this page happen at all?”
- A good platform team makes the experience of migration as painless as possible for their customers through careful planning and automation. A bad platform team, on the other hand, exposes developers to a great deal of churn and pain with updates and migrations that require significant work and planning on the part of the engineering teams themselves.
- Nevertheless, it is worth coaching yourself (and your team) to be humble and realistic about what you do and don’t know, and mindful that sometimes what you can intuit will be clear to your stakeholders only after they see the results of their build.
  Sometimes you will be surprised by what the shadow team can pull off, particularly if they have a more “pioneering” mindset (as we discussed in Chapter 8). An idea that you thought was impossible might turn out to be just barely doable, and bring a lot of value to the users despite the operational challenges.
- A willingness to invest in observability not just for platform team members, but also for customers and incident managers.
- It’s usually not realistic to expect platform engineers to take on the burden of fixing business systems; they can help application developers do this, but they can’t own those applications or processes in the long term. If these systems are important to running business processes, then they need clear ownership.
- Yes, sometimes this means you end up having to take over their barely working system, playing the cleanup crew that turns it into a platform-quality offering. But there are a lot of good ideas that come from people close to a problem. Your team will sometimes be the recipient of good ideas, questionably implemented; embrace the cleanup as an opportunity when it comes.
- A willingness from the platform team’s leadership to push back against unreasonable expectations of application teams and their leadership, helping them understand that a burnt-out team of platform engineers with high turnover will not actually give them the SaaS company level of support they think they deserve.3
- Anyone who has worked for a company in its growth stages has probably observed the following scenario: a lot of people have come and gone over the years, and now there are a number of technology assets that are still used but that no one seems to own.
- In tough times every team ends up rejustifying its size and roadmap, and business-aligned application engineering teams are not given a pass on this pain any more than platform teams are.
- Things to track include:
  Who is using the platform
  Which applications are using the platform, and which parts of it they are using
  Who owns those applications
- If you find yourself in this situation, you need to do everything you can to tie your work much more directly to the success of protected business outcomes. Whether it is enabling someone’s pet project, making the engineering lead of the flagship product team happy, or successfully selling a story about the unacceptable risks that will happen if you don’t invest in your platform, now is the time to double down on aligning yourself with business outcomes.
- Background, tenets, and guidelines
  Describe the current situation, providing any relevant information as to how you got here, and establish any core tenets, requirements, or guidelines;
- Building automatic asset tracking for technologies, deployments, and dependencies and creating graphs of the existing running infrastructure across your company can be extremely valuable in supporting more complex upgrades.
- Start by going through all of the work you’re doing that is not in the KTLO category, and for each major project, ask which customers want it and what the value is. For those projects that are closely coupled to delivering some high-profile product or business initiative, you’re good.
- If you want your long-running projects to go well, everyone should have an idea of what you’re trying to achieve in the first place. The project leads need to write down their ideas in a proposal or requirements document for management and other engineers to review and evaluate.
- True, there’s nothing “cloud native” about maintenance windows, but depending on the type of platform you are providing, you may need occasional planned downtime. If this is the case for your system, don’t try to negotiate this ad hoc every time you need it. Create an up-front expectation of when maintenance downtime is allowed so that both your team and your users can plan for these disruptions.
- You’ll probably also end up building more valuable things in the process by ensuring that your teams are getting creative about how to tie their work to the highest-value customers.
- As a platform leader, you must get comfortable with overseeing big, long-running projects and helping teams break them down into incremental milestones.
- Instead, we think transparent migrations are better achieved with a combination of judicious APIs and newer technologies that make it much easier to run multiple versions of your platform in production during the migration period, slowly and safely moving each customer’s requests across as their clients are updated.

Stop! Here is the last set. Now write the draft review

### 11. Your Platforms Are Aligned
- One key distinction between platform engineering and much of application engineering is that platform projects often have significantly longer timelines. Building, testing, and migrating to a new system can take months or even years, depending on the size of your company.
- Instead, we think transparent migrations are better achieved with a combination of judicious APIs and newer technologies that make it much easier to run multiple versions of your platform in production during the migration period, slowly and safely moving each customer’s requests across as their clients are updated.
- When we dug into why there was such a strong disagreement here, it became clear that the OS platform team’s leadership was not yet aligned on thinking of it as a platform engineering team. Instead, they still held an “infrastructure” mindset. They were in conflict with partners because they viewed their goal as prioritizing the technical quality of the solution above all else.
- Whether the team is failing to plan, failing to incrementally execute, or failing to educate their stakeholders on the current state of things, the view of those outside the organization is the same: this team isn’t delivering.
- Instead, we think transparent migrations are better achieved with a combination of judicious APIs and newer technologies that make it much easier to run multiple versions of your platform in production during the migration period, slowly and safely moving each customer’s requests across as their clients are updated.
- So, be careful about using adoption as anything other than a secondary metric. Instead, think about how you are delivering leverage by understanding who will benefit most from your platform, and targeting the adoption of those most valuable customers by working with them to identify measurable pain points that your new platform will address.
- most difficult failures happened when the team was building the right things, but not demonstrating it to the organization.
- Instead, we think transparent migrations are better achieved with a combination of judicious APIs and newer technologies that make it much easier to run multiple versions of your platform in production during the migration period, slowly and safely moving each customer’s requests across as their clients are updated.
- This matters because you dilute your leverage every time your platform team generates work for its customers. When the platform team makes the customers responsible for driving their own adoption, whether by expecting customers to write their own requirements or forcing them to migrate to the newest product, they drain the very productivity they’re supposed to be safeguarding. When the platform team is out of alignment and competes with itself for customer attention by delivering offerings that don’t work well together, it contributes to the complexity and confusion that it’s supposed to be solving for.
- The point of operational reviews is to close the feedback loop by shifting engineering time in response to the operational data that the team is receiving. If the leaders who need to make those calls are not actively part of the meeting, then you cannot close this loop.
- An ideal platform provides a stable interface to the customer, allowing the platform team to execute the migrations with minimal to no customer impact. Pushing frequent migration work onto your customers undermines that value, and as the platform builder and operator, you can do better.
- But 100% adoption only truly measures success when your customers have a choice of whether or not to use your platforms. The risk of using adoption metrics when you are targeting a captive or nearly captive audience is forgetting to build what people want, and instead building what you think they should want and then forcing them to use it.
- There are two essential things to cover:
  Postmortems for the highest-impact incidents/outages
  Some metric-level review with discussion of outliers (for example, looking at SLOs, support metrics, or pager metrics)
- Glue is OK in moderation, but the more glue that exists, the more work is required whenever one of the pieces needs to change. The problem is worst when every application team has created lots of it—platforms should limit the glue that each application team builds for itself over basic infrastructure and common services, because glue is the enemy of change.
  If you have built a good platform abstraction, application teams will have minimal glue of their own to change during migration of the underlying components.
- Misaligned platform teams create a swamp of a different kind than the “over-general” one we described in Chapter 1. This swamp is filled with overlapping and incompatible products, tricky to use together and often at odds with each other’s goals
- Getting team-level meetings to the point where they drive the right action is a bit of an art specific to your company’s culture. With newly formed teams or newly hired managers, it’s easy for them to devolve into pointless theatrics that don’t have any value.
- The more you can standardize and limit variation, the fewer permutations you need to worry about during these changes.
- The purpose of a team is not goal attainment but goal alignment. When the team is fulfilling its purpose, team members are more effective because they’re more directed.
  Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister, Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams
- Operational reviews close the loop to drive action. They are a practice from seasoned operations organizations in which engineers and management come together on a regular cadence (usually weekly) to review broad measures like SLO metrics as well as specifics like incident postmortems. They leverage human attention to analyze data as a group, enabling the identification of early outliers, bad trends, and broader lessons. With management and engineering actively engaged, operational reviews create a shared understanding of nascent problems that drives action well ahead of them becoming chronic.
- By this we don’t mean starting on the perfect rearchitecture to make future migrations cheap. We mean doing whatever scrappy work you can to make the next pressing migration as cheap as you can.
### III. What Does Success Look Like?
- When Ian was building industry-foundational platforms at AWS, synthetic monitoring was used in place of almost all functional integration testing under the argument that if you wanted to test for something before every release, wouldn’t you want to ensure that the same issue was not happening in production?
- The scrappy get ’er done energy that worked when you had a few dozen engineers starts to break down when you have a few hundred. The engineering organization that wants to move as fast as it did when it was small must wrestle with all of the complexity that comes with time, scale, and success, and migrations become a growing source of frustration and anger for them.
- Sometimes changes underfoot mean you will be failing, and often in correcting you will face trade-offs. But if you adjust direction when the balance is not right, and are patient in waiting for your journey on a calibrated path to start showing results, you will get your platform to where the company needs it to be.
- When a customer is having issues, the well-understood nature of the synthetic test load often helps with triangulation, letting you easily determine whether the problem is in the platform for all users, or just in how the customer is using it. If the synthetic load is seeing it, you will often have a lot more historical data available to understand which system component is the cause.
- Before you start on the communication planning, the inevitable program management, and the other rules and processes you might need to impose, think about the engineering you can do to ease migration pain now and in the future.
- Thus, we recommend a holistic approach to evaluating ongoing success by focusing on four areas that will tell you whether you are on the best path:
  Your platforms are aligned.
  Your platforms are trusted.
  Your platforms manage complexity.
  Your platforms are loved.
- Even if debugging a flaky synthetic test doesn’t preemptively identify a customer-impacting issue, your engineers will get real experience troubleshooting issues in the production platform. This practice should drive down the MTTR when they eventually need to handle real issues.
- For the purposes of this chapter, a migration is any mandatory change to your platforms that requires some work by the users in order to adopt.
- But these metrics and models are most useful as broad signals that measure past actions, too simplistic and lagging to capture the full picture of your situation and point you toward your next successful investments.
- Both the development and the operation of synthetic tests force platform engineers to get firsthand experience developing an application that runs on their platform. This means that even though the work the monitoring application does is synthetic, it gives a lot of the same feedback benefits as dogfooding.7
- We’ve mentioned migrations several times already in this book, and for good reason. In the face of this challenge, great platform teams realize that migrations are in fact an opportunity to prove their value. They see their job as easing the pain of mandatory migrations, limiting and even removing work so their customers can focus on delivering top-line features.
- On top of this, even when you are progressing, delivering value is slow; it takes time to build a high-quality product, time to convince customers to use it, and time to migrate everyone.
- Synthetic monitoring covers gaps in passive monitoring and alerts you to real issues before your customers report them.
- A platform is meant to be the stable thing that provides an enduring surface to build on, like a foundation. Platform engineering requires building those stable foundations and not externalizing work onto the things that people build on top of it.
  C. Scott Andreas
- The day-to-day reality of stakeholder relationships kicks in whenever you need to negotiate and compromise. It’s crucial to stay flexible and responsive, even when plans seem to change out of the blue. Say yes when it’s easy, and say yes when the request has clear, pressing business value. Sometimes you’ll need to say no, or not yet, and accept that the application team might build their own shadow platform. Always aim for the win/win: if you can even just provide advice on their platform, it sets you up to learn from what they build and possibly even take over the platform in the future if it becomes successful.
- By actively exercising the full system, synthetic monitoring is your main way of understanding what is happening within and across those primitives.
- “I will allow hiring of project managers only when you’ve proven to me that we have done everything we can to automate the work that those project managers might do. Show me that we’ve tried to do this without project management and hit the wall, and we can hire. Until then, be creative.
- Your stakeholders can make your life easier or harder, and it’s up to you to manage those relationships for the good of your team, the platform, and the company as a whole.
- Synthetic monitoring, also called active monitoring, simulates a user interacting with the production platform; it measures not just latency and availability but correctness of function, and it raises alerts when objectives are not met.
- Which parts of the upgrade could they automate entirely? Which parts could they explain in the context of the ticket that a user got when it was time for their system to proceed?
- In our experience, platform teams live and die on their success at stakeholder relationship management, and we can’t overemphasize how valuable it is to develop good practices throughout your team. You need to understand how your stakeholders relate to your team, what they care about, and how to communicate and negotiate effectively with them.
- Enough has been written about the “three pillars” of observability—metrics, logs, and tracing—that we don’t need to reiterate their value here. We agree that deep investment in passive monitoring of all of these is crucial for the operability of your platforms.
- But the migration was a significant step forward as compared to prior updates, because the team took the time up front not only to plan the migration itself, but also to think about tooling, automation, observability, and customer-centric approaches to ease the pain for everyone involved in the process.
- Strong stakeholder relationships coming into this exercise will minimize the pain; there’s no escaping the cuts, but the trust you’ve established should give you the power to shape them in the way you think is best.
- If a platform team is spending more than 12 developer months per calendar year on release engineering, they may be overbuilding it.
- And this spells out one of the basic requirements for any team attempting to become a modern platform team: you must plan for and take on the bulk of the work for customer migrations if you want to claim this role.
- Having coached many teams through budget downcycles, we recommend that you preemptively decide what you think should be reduced or eliminated and come to the table ready to make those suggestions.
- Be careful of letting the platform team go too far with release engineering, turning what should be platform automation into a full-featured shadow deployment platform.
- And this spells out one of the basic requirements for any team attempting to become a modern platform team: you must plan for and take on the bulk of the work for customer migrations if you want to claim this role.
- You are the expert and owner of this area—show that expertise and ownership by defending the things that others don’t understand or appreciate but that you strongly believe are essential.
- until the new automation is written, the additional work of change management adds toil to each change, making engineers less happy and diverting time from development activities, including building the automation.
- And this spells out one of the basic requirements for any team attempting to become a modern platform team: you must plan for and take on the bulk of the work for customer migrations if you want to claim this role.
- If you try to defend every single thing your team is working on and justify why you can’t possibly cut anything, you will signal to your stakeholders that you aren’t taking this situation seriously and aren’t listening to the message that you need to make changes. It is important, however, that you make the case for why the most important work matters, particularly if it is a speculative investment or deeply technical.
- To avoid landing in this situation, you need to invest in change management, as that will create the feedback that tells you that you are relying on risky behavior and need to invest in release engineering automation while the people who understand the system’s sharp edges are still around. This can be quite simple as a process—just a short writeup on a wiki or chat that has to be acknowledged by another team member. But you must build a culture of adherence, using operational reviews to ensure both that the process is being followed and that automation for risky or toilsome steps is being invested in.
- And this spells out one of the basic requirements for any team attempting to become a modern platform team: you must plan for and take on the bulk of the work for customer migrations if you want to claim this role.
- Step 3: Come with Suggestions of What to Cut and Strong Opinions About What to Keep
- Change management is rigor around the mechanics of all changes to production, similar to the best practices for changes to code:
  All changes to production should be documented.
  All changes to production should be reviewed.
  All changes to production should be tested before handling production load directly.5
- Showing them how to do these partial migrations (either through tooling that you build or detailed documentation of the process using tooling that already exists) is important to support the off-ramp from the old system and the on-ramp to the new one.
- Step 2: Group the Work into Teams (Don’t Go Person-by-Person)
- All this is to say that customer-facing SLOs/error budgets are an expensive additional cost on top of internal observability, and they are something we think you should require only when you have teams with issues severe enough to be worth that cost
- The reason for this is that few companies have support for creating good documentation of this kind, and leaving it to the engineers as yet another job is likely to lead to poorly written and rapidly out of date documentation that does as much to confuse people as it does to educate them. But migrations are a case where good usage-level documentation can be a major differentiator, and given that they are a one-off exercise, you can often write it once2 and forgo the concern about it becoming outdated.
- Step 1: Figure Out Who Will Benefit Tomorrow
- Crucially, all of this is the opposite of how a platform team should use SLOs internally, where they should be most worried about understanding the operating conditions and risks of the system.
- Scope backward from hard deadlines in the next 12 months.
- when you need to do justifications (or worse, cuts), your goal should be to determine whole initiatives to cut so that you can spare other initiatives and retain their focus.
- False negatives are tolerable, but require explanation and improvement.
- Leave the heavy coordination planning until you are closer to that 12-month time frame, at which point you should have a good and, notably, easy-to-follow process to ask of your users.
- Unless your team is very small, you do not want to report on which individuals are doing what work. Offering up this detail invites pointless scrutiny, and you are pretending to have accuracy you probably can’t deliver.
  Instead, group the work into chunks that are no smaller than a single project team (say, 3–5 people at the smallest) can handle, and no bigger than a double-sized team (up to 10–12) can manage.
- This means that, for SLOs that are presented to leaders and customers, eliminating false positives from the metric is crucial.
- Limit coupling of in-flight customer work.
### 10. Managing Stakeholder Relationships
- Shrink it and fold it into something that everyone agrees is important. As mentioned previously, you will need to buy yourself some breathing room, and aligning speculative work with necessary work is a good tactic for this.
- If you were failing your SLO last week but the business kept chugging along, then why does it matter this week if you are failing again?
- Do the work to show business value
  This means making a case for how this project could benefit the business, getting stakeholders aligned, and accelerating the roadmap to value creation.
- They need to minimize false positives.
- Look for compromises around the scope and timing of this new feature. Is there a stripped-down offering that you can create faster that will unblock their most valuable business needs? Or can they adjust their own timelines to give you extra time to deliver while they concentrate on other parts of the work? Once you’ve negotiated the minimal realistic “yes,” you may need to make sure other stakeholders are aware of the priority changes and any impacts this might have on them. But don’t be afraid to support a team just because it wasn’t in your original plans.
- If your team feels strongly about the project’s value, you should give them a chance to sell it—cutting it will likely be very demotivating, and this is a great opportunity to teach them how to sell their ideas to skeptical stakeholders.
- The more SLOs you have, the harder it is for your stakeholders to understand how those SLOs matter to the business.
- But it’s also good to say yes when someone brings you a feature request that should clearly be provided by your platform, backed by a pressing business deliverable and evidence that this feature is on the critical path for that business deliverable. In this case, don’t fight with them over the unexpected request; instead, figure out what compromises might be needed to get it done.
- The fewer customer-facing SLOs, the better—ideally, a handful.
- This is why some of the least effective platform leaders we have managed were often the ones who had the strongest technical and product vision for their platform. They mistakenly believed that this vision gave them the necessary knowledge to make the right choices for the business. This led them to refuse to compromise with stakeholders who saw potential value differently, insisting on only doing things aligned with their vision.
- As you likely know, service level agreements are composed of service level objectives, which are measured and evaluated by service level indicators (SLIs), and SLIs feed into error budgets.
- However, the other extreme, where you are totally inflexible and build only what you think is right and aligned with your platform strategy, is equally impossible. You should be working closely with your customers, ultimately trying to deliver value to the overall company and business.
- four essential practices that empower platform teams to balance feature development and operational investment before operational problems become acute. These practices cover the lifecycle of production applications: SLOs and SLAs are informed by requirements, change management ensures you know what is being released is of high quality, synthetic monitoring goes beyond basic observability to actively detect failures in our running systems, and operational reviews look at recent history to review what is going well or not and inform upcoming work and areas of focus.
- Whatever the reason, it’s important to remain somewhat flexible and responsive to these types of requests. Particularly when you’re asked to do something that does not imply either a large up-front development investment or a high ongoing support burden, you should try to flex to support your high-profile customers to buy some political capital.
- Your stakeholders should not need to accept your word about your business impact. They should be able to see it.

### **Book Review: *Platform Engineering* by Camille Fournier and Ian Nowland**

#### **Overview**
*Platform Engineering* is a deeply insightful and practical guide to the evolving discipline of platform engineering. Co-authored by **Camille Fournier and Ian Nowland**, both seasoned engineering leaders, the book explores **how to design, build, operate, and scale** internal platforms that empower application teams while maintaining **operational stability** and **business alignment**. 

Rather than focusing purely on technology, the book presents **a holistic perspective**, integrating **organizational strategy, stakeholder management, and operational discipline**. It methodically builds an understanding of **why** platform engineering is critical, **what principles guide successful platform teams**, and **how to execute effectively**. 

For engineering leaders, technical architects, and platform engineers alike, *Platform Engineering* serves as both a **practical handbook** and **a strategic playbook**, offering **battle-tested insights** into **navigating the complexities of building internal developer platforms at scale**.

---

### **Key Themes and Takeaways**

#### **1. The Evolution of Platform Engineering**
The book opens with an exploration of **why platform engineering is becoming essential**. It traces the evolution from **DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)** and explains **why many organizations have struggled to adopt those models effectively** outside of companies like Google. The authors argue that **traditional infrastructure teams often fail to meet developer needs**, and **platform engineering fills this gap by providing opinionated, productized infrastructure**.

At its core, **platform engineering is about reducing system complexity**—not just through automation, but by **curating** a limited set of tools and abstractions that streamline development and operations. The book highlights the shift from **“glue work” (custom integrations and one-off automation) to well-defined platforms** that provide **leverage across engineering teams**.

#### **2. Platform Engineering as a Product**
One of the book’s strongest arguments is that **platforms should be treated as internal products**. The authors emphasize **a customer-centric approach**, where **developers are the primary users**, and successful platforms **prioritize usability, adoption, and long-term maintainability**.

Key product principles include:
- **Curated, not exhaustive** – A good platform isn’t just a collection of tools; it’s a **deliberate set of opinionated choices** that balance developer flexibility with operational efficiency.
- **Paved paths and railways** – The book introduces the concept of **paved paths** (opinionated workflows that simplify common tasks) and **railways** (custom-built internal services that solve specific problems at scale).
- **Balancing innovation and standardization** – A platform should **enable experimentation** but also ensure **consistent, reliable foundations** for the broader organization.

#### **3. Running and Operating Platforms**
A significant portion of the book is dedicated to the **operational aspects of platform engineering**. The authors argue that **building a platform is only half the battle—running it as a stable foundation is equally important**.

Key operational practices include:
- **On-call and incident management** – Platform teams should **own the full operational responsibility** of their platforms, ensuring stability while minimizing disruptions for developers.
- **Observability and synthetic monitoring** – Monitoring should go beyond passive observability (metrics, logs, tracing) to include **active synthetic monitoring**, where test workloads mimic real user behavior.
- **Operational reviews** – Regular **operational retrospectives** help identify **trends, bottlenecks, and reliability risks** before they become systemic issues.

A recurring theme is that **platform teams should aim to “own the complexity” of infrastructure**, shielding developers from unnecessary overhead. Instead of forcing teams to migrate manually, **platform teams should invest in tooling and automation to make migrations seamless**.

#### **4. Stakeholder Management and Organizational Alignment**
A core insight in the book is that **platform engineering is as much about people and process as it is about technology**. Successful platform teams **don’t just build great technology; they align with business priorities and manage stakeholder expectations effectively**.

Key stakeholder management strategies include:
- **Proactive communication** – Regular interlock meetings, product roadmaps, and transparent updates help **bridge the gap between platform teams and their users**.
- **Balancing feature requests and business impact** – Not all requests are equal; platform teams must **evaluate work in terms of leverage and business value**.
- **Handling competing priorities** – Platform teams often face pressure from different stakeholders. The book provides guidance on **navigating these tensions strategically**.

The book also introduces **the power-interest grid**—a framework for identifying key stakeholders based on their influence and engagement. This helps platform teams **prioritize relationships that matter most**.

#### **5. Managing Migrations and Sunsetting Platforms**
The final sections of the book tackle one of the most difficult challenges in platform engineering: **migrations and deprecations**. The authors argue that **migrations should be treated as opportunities to prove the value of the platform**, rather than as painful disruptions for developers.

Key principles include:
- **Making migrations as invisible as possible** – Platform teams should take on the **majority of the migration burden**, using **transparent APIs and automated tooling** to reduce customer effort.
- **Planning deprecations carefully** – Instead of forcing teams to migrate immediately, **gradual sunsetting strategies** help reduce friction.
- **Avoiding overreach** – Not all centralization is beneficial. **Some systems are best owned by application teams** rather than being forced into a one-size-fits-all platform.

---

### **Strengths of the Book**
1. **Real-World Insights** – The authors draw from their extensive experience at companies like **Google, AWS, and Two Sigma**, offering **battle-tested advice** on what works (and what doesn’t) in platform engineering.
2. **Holistic Approach** – The book goes beyond technology to **cover product management, leadership, and organizational dynamics**, making it valuable for **engineering managers and senior technical leaders**.
3. **Practical Frameworks and Processes** – From **stakeholder mapping** to **operational reviews**, the book provides **actionable frameworks** that teams can adopt immediately.
4. **Balanced Perspective** – Unlike many books that present idealized models, *Platform Engineering* acknowledges **the messy realities of large-scale engineering** and provides **pragmatic strategies** for navigating complexity.

---

### **Who Should Read This Book?**
- **Engineering Managers & Directors** – Those leading **platform, DevOps, or infrastructure teams** will gain **valuable insights on managing teams, stakeholders, and long-term platform strategy**.
- **Platform Engineers & SREs** – Engineers working on **internal tooling, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, or developer productivity** will find **detailed guidance on building scalable, reliable platforms**.
- **Technical Architects & CTOs** – Decision-makers responsible for **engineering strategy** will benefit from the book’s **principles on platform scalability, reliability, and adoption**.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
*Platform Engineering* is a **must-read for anyone building or operating internal platforms at scale**. It blends **technical depth with leadership wisdom**, making it an essential resource for **modern engineering organizations**. 

Rather than treating platform engineering as just an extension of DevOps or SRE, the book frames it as **a distinct discipline that requires both engineering excellence and product thinking**. The focus on **alignment, trust, complexity management, and adoption** makes it **one of the most comprehensive books available on this topic**.

For organizations investing in platform engineering, this book provides **the playbook for building platforms that developers love, businesses trust, and engineering teams can rely on**.

**Rating: ★★★★★ (Highly Recommended)**

Get rid of the bold and the sections and make it more concise so it's about 1/2 to 2/3 the current length. Do this by removing redundancies and removing unnecessary descriptors and instead focusing on the concrete substance.

*Platform Engineering* by Camille Fournier and Ian Nowland provides a **comprehensive guide** to designing, building, and operating internal platforms that streamline development while maintaining operational stability. The book blends technical depth with organizational strategy, offering practical insights for engineering leaders and platform teams.

The authors outline the evolution of platform engineering from DevOps and SRE, explaining why traditional infrastructure teams often fail to meet developer needs. Platform engineering reduces system complexity by curating a **limited set of tools and abstractions**, shifting away from custom integrations and one-off automation to **scalable, opinionated infrastructure**.

A key theme is treating platforms as **internal products** with developers as customers. Successful platforms prioritize usability, provide **paved paths for common workflows**, and balance **standardization with developer flexibility**. Instead of offering endless choices, effective platforms make **deliberate trade-offs**, ensuring adoption without sacrificing ease of use.

The book details operational best practices, emphasizing **on-call management, observability, and proactive monitoring**. The authors argue that **platform teams should own the operational burden**, shielding application developers from infrastructure complexity. They also stress **operational reviews**, where engineering and management analyze trends, identify risks, and adjust priorities.

Beyond technology, *Platform Engineering* highlights **stakeholder management** as crucial for platform success. Platform teams must balance feature requests with business impact, navigate competing priorities, and maintain strong relationships across the organization. A structured approach, such as **interlock meetings and roadmap transparency**, helps align platform work with business needs.

Migrations and platform sunsetting are tackled in depth. Rather than offloading migration work onto developers, the book argues that **platform teams should take on the bulk of this effort**, leveraging **APIs, automation, and gradual rollouts** to minimize disruptions. The authors caution against **overreach**—not all systems should be centralized, and some are best left in the hands of application teams.

The book also explores **measuring platform success**, recommending a focus on **alignment, trust, complexity management, and adoption** rather than raw usage metrics. A platform succeeds when it enables developers to **build and ship efficiently without unnecessary friction**.

With insights drawn from experience at Google, AWS, and Two Sigma, the book blends **engineering best practices with leadership guidance**, making it valuable for **engineering managers, platform teams, and technical leaders**. It’s an essential read for those investing in **scalable, reliable internal platforms that drive developer productivity and business impact**.
