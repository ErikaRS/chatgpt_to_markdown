Wolfi is a specialized Linux distribution designed for the cloud-native and containerized environments. Developed by Chainguard, Wolfi aims to create a secure, minimal base layer for containers. Unlike traditional Linux distributions, Wolfi does not include a kernel; instead, it relies on the container runtime to provide the necessary kernel. This design choice enhances security and efficiency by minimizing resource usage and focusing only on essential components.

Wolfi's features include providing high-quality Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all packages, a fully declarative and reproducible build system, and the use of the reliable APK package format. It also emphasizes supply chain security by ensuring packages are granular and independent, which supports the creation of minimal container images.

Wolfi is particularly beneficial for developers looking for a streamlined, secure, and up-to-date platform for automated and dynamic software deployments. The project is community-driven, with contributions from a global network of developers enhancing its capabilities continuously.
