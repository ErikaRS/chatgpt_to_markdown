Here is a question from an individual contributor at a company. Please accept it without comment.

What are the expectations for prioritizing (1) bugs and (2) general support requests received from prospects and customers? During my chat with Aimee, I learnt that about 80% or more prospects convert to customers. Given that, should prospects be prioritized at the same level as customers?
On the Graph team, we've been trying to add some docs as we go, but the sheer surface area of the code means that it will still take quite some time for it to start paying dividends in terms of customers, Customer Engineers and Support Engineers being able to self-service more types of issues.
We had some of this discussion during PFP, where the guidance was that we should try to limit the time so as to not affect feature velocity that much. However, in practice, because we only have 3 engineers on the team and a large variation in task-relevant familiarity, balancing time spent on support requests and feature work has been a struggle.

Here is a discussion among the people putting together an answer to the question. Please draft a concise, thoughtful response to the question that acknowledges the team's workload and avoids being passive aggressive.

To be clear I said from stage 4 we have had a ~80% win rate because we were talking about the technical sale which I can clarify in the response. I said think of it as a funnel, the further they progress the higher the probability they close…
That aside I’m happy to respond to this.
Summary of main points:
Clarify sales funnel and probability increase with stage progression; reiterate that we have shown ~80% win rate from stage 4
We have SLAs that guide relative priority based on the impact of the problem and that is consistent whether a prospect or customer.
When we need to ask for help from Eng we share context around the need and impact.
CE is technically qualifying and influencing customers down supported, happy paths and we don’t run into issues (most opps never require any support).
All to say this is why we 1) need to have a single view of asks, 2) need a single process to making asks, and 3) expect GTM to provide that overall prioritization taking into account customer vs prospect temperature, revenue impact, etc.
(good opportunity to highlight how important it is to get this RFC approved)
Mention how important docs are for customers being able to self-serve and how this is a shared responsibility from everyone in the company. Emphasize if we see threads in slack that contain info that would benefit customers anyone can and should add to docs or post in #docs for visibility
Anything to add or change :point_up_2: ?

 those points sound good to me. I'm also happy to jump in and add some more support for the importance of getting doc improvements in, which I think is especially relevant for Precise.

It feels like there’s a question or worry behind the question. He’s referring to the PFP comment I made about how they need to make the feature lovable for all users instead of just targeting specific customers, which had taken up the majority of their time previously and meant this feature always struggled to have an impact. We need to reinforce that in the reply. I think everything else you mentioned 
@Aimee Menne
 is not relevant to his actual question or concern.

In keeping with the “feature conveyor belt” idea (first get features to self-serve devs on Cody Free/Pro and dotcom, because it’s way way faster to iterate there than with Ent customers), and as we discussed during PFP, the graph team should prioritize making code nav lovable on dotcom/self-serve not Ent customers.
If the graph team also prioritizes support from prospects, it would mean that lovability is going to be even harder to reach, and the iteration cycle with prospects is even slower than that with customers (because with prospects we need to tiptoe a bit more and don’t have a solid deployment already).
Ultimately we want it all: code nav to work great for all users, including at prospects and customers. But we’ve seen the fastest way to get there is by initially targeting an environment (self-serve/dotcom) where we can iterate much much faster, and then getting those improvements to the enterprise on a delay after they have stabilized, been validated, and matured.
There is some % of time that you should reserve for enterprise customer support, but that should be ~20%. And since it’s been a couple months since the PFP, there should be things you’ve already shipped to dotcom that have worked and are getting ready to ship to the enterprise by now.

My main comment here is that we don't want the rest of the company (Sales and TS) to read this as we aren't helping Ent customers or prospects...
Specifically:
If the graph team also prioritizes support from prospects, it would mean that lovability is going to be even harder to reach, and the iteration cycle with prospects is even slower than that with customers (because with prospects we need to tiptoe a bit more and don’t have a solid deployment already).
We want to keep Ent support to a minimum by having a stable, solid product that's well documented. We try to lead our prospects down happy, supported paths so they don't need help.
IF help is needed, we have a mechanism for helping them and we aim to keep that at under 20% of any teams' time (isn't that what we said across the board 
@Erika Rice Scherpelz
)? (edited)

Just calling that typically when it is everyone’s responsibility it is no one’s responsibility.Would require a major cultural shift in how we approach docs to make the above a thing.
Not saying we can’t but are we as leaders actually willing and able to drive that? i.e. driving people to update docs, pushing for it when we see it in slack and in meetings, following up and holding people accountable to doing it, etc.

They should be able to fit a lot of docs update and support into that 20%. That’s 1 day per week.

Hey Varun, thanks for the question! I'd actually reframe this slightly - it's less about prospects vs customers, but more so about prioritizing self-serve / dotcom because anything we do to support them will ultimately benefit customers and prospects (eg feature-conveyor belt).
During PFP, we asked the graph team to prioritize making code nav lovable on dotcom/self-serve first and foremost. In fact, as it’s been a couple months since the PFP, there should be things you’ve already shipped to dotcom that have worked and are getting ready to ship to the enterprise by now. This guidance is true for all teams, not just graph, by the way.
If any eng team prioritized support for prospects, it would mean that lovability is going to be even harder to reach, and the iteration cycle with prospects is even slower than that with customers (because with prospects we need to tiptoe a bit more and don’t have a solid deployment already).
Ultimately we want it all: code nav to work great for all users, including at prospects and customers. But we’ve seen the fastest way to get there is by initially targeting an environment (self-serve/dotcom) where we can iterate much much faster, and then getting those improvements to the enterprise on a delay after they have stabilized, been validated, and matured.
That isn't to say our Ent customers and prospects aren't important to us. We want to keep Ent support to a minimum by having a stable, solid product that's well-documented. We try to lead our prospects down happy, supported paths so they don't need help at all. If help is needed, we have a mechanism for helping them and we aim to keep that at under 20% of any individual teams' time. This 20% is also intended to include time for bug fixes and documentation as well.

@Aimee Menne
 it feels important to correct his comment about the sales funnel (~80% win rate from stage 4, not from the top of the funnel). For other teammates who see this in passing, I want to make sure we set the record straight on that.
In general, I think you can get the point faster up front. The TL;DR I get from this is “Don’t think of this as should we prioritize prospects vs customers, but instead think of this as prioritize self-serve/dot com, because that work will ultimately support Ent prospects and customers down the line”.
Also, I’d add a line to make it clear that this same guidance applies beyond the graph team. I think it’s fine that we catered to his role here, but for anybody else reading this, it should be clear that the same guidance goes for their work too.

Overall, I'm not super aligned with this as a message. While I don't disagree with the facts (other than that it's been a couple months since PFP planning. It's only been 1.5 - with 1 week of merge!), I think the tone feels off and a bit passive aggressive, TBH. Let me draft my own version and see where we can get it.

### Assistant - 2024-03-20 10:12:42

In response to your question regarding the prioritization of bugs and general support requests from prospects and customers, it's important to clarify our approach and acknowledge the challenges our team faces, particularly given our recent conversations and the insights shared during PFP.

Our focus has been on enhancing the self-service capabilities on dotcom, guided by the understanding that improvements here invariably benefit both our current customers and prospective users. This approach is rooted in the belief that by creating a more lovable and functional product for self-serve users, we indirectly support our enterprise prospects and customers by delivering a more stable, reliable, and well-documented product.

We recognize the high conversion rate (~80% from stage 4) of prospects to customers, indicating the critical role of supporting our prospects through their decision-making journey. However, this doesn't necessarily translate to prioritizing prospects over existing customers. Instead, we strive for a balanced approach that considers the impact and urgency of issues, guided by our service level agreements (SLAs). These SLAs are designed to ensure we effectively address high-impact problems promptly, regardless of whether they arise from current customers or prospects.

Documentation plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. By improving our docs, we empower users to resolve more of their issues independently, reducing the direct support needed. This effort is a collective responsibility that extends across the team, contributing to a more sustainable model for handling support requests without disproportionately affecting our feature development velocity.

Addressing your concern about balancing support requests and feature work, especially with a limited engineering team, it's a challenge we are acutely aware of. We are continuously looking for ways to optimize our processes and resources. The allocation of approximately 20% of our time towards support, bug fixes, and documentation is a testament to our commitment to maintaining this balance while ensuring we continue to innovate and push forward on our product roadmap.

We also acknowledge the importance of not sending mixed messages to other departments, such as Sales and Technical Support, regarding our commitment to supporting enterprise customers and prospects. Our goal is to ensure a solid, stable product and to streamline the support process to be as efficient and minimal as possible, aligning with our broader strategy of prioritizing work that benefits the majority of our users.

In closing, we appreciate the thoughtful discussion around these topics and recognize the need for continued dialogue to refine our approach. As we move forward, we remain committed to delivering exceptional value to all our users—whether they are prospects in the early stages of engagement or long-standing customers—while also managing our resources effectively to support sustainable growth and innovation.

That's way too long. Please make it shorter and get rid of the part about the sales pipeline.

### Assistant - 2024-03-20 10:13:28

Addressing the prioritization of bugs and support requests from both prospects and customers involves a balanced approach that aligns with our overall strategy and acknowledges the current team dynamics.

Our strategy focuses on enhancing self-serve capabilities on dotcom, which we believe benefits all users by improving product stability, functionality, and documentation. This approach indirectly supports both prospects and customers, aiming for a product that requires minimal direct support.

We follow service level agreements (SLAs) to ensure urgent and high-impact issues are addressed promptly, regardless of their source. This ensures a consistent and fair prioritization of work.

Given the limited size of our engineering team and the diverse range of tasks, we strive to maintain a balance between addressing support requests and progressing feature development. We allocate roughly 20% of our time to support, bug fixes, and documentation efforts. This allocation helps manage workload while fostering product improvement and innovation.

We're committed to continuous dialogue and process refinement to optimize our support strategy, aiming to deliver high value to all users efficiently and effectively.

I didn't like the original draft response at all, so here's mine. Please make it more clear and concise and also point out any obvious points from the discussion I missed.

DRAFT
Hey Varun, thanks for the question! I know the Graph team has a large surface area and a high support load and figuring out how to prioritize it has been a challenge. 

The general guidance these days is that we’d like to be spending about 20% of the team’s capacity on work that is Enterprise focused or targeted to specific customers. That's about 1 day per person per week on average. 

Within that capacity, the team should work with TS to understand which customer escalations and feature gaps are most important. This should be a collaboration, not guesswork the Graph team has to do, and @Aimee Menne is working with her team on providing more consistency around escalation paths. 

When the team has capacity beyond that, then for this team in particular, I would love to see investments in the sort of work that reduces future work. The documentation work you mentioned is an important part of this. The more that we can enable Support and CE to handle things (or customers to self service!) the happier everyone involved – customers, TS, and Eng – will be. 

What if even that prioritized support work exceeds the 20% target? Then you should loop back with me and we can talk specifics. Should we set a stricter standard? Invest more in particular changes that can eliminate classes of escalations? Consider having more budget? Once we have data, we can explore options.

Also, although it wasn't your core question, I want to revisit why we have this emphasis on spending 80% of our time on general lovability features. Our goal is to have a product that earns retention and expansion. This requires building broadly used, useful, lovable features. We've seen that the fastest way to do this is by targeting an environment (for Code Search, dotcom) where we can iterate quickly and then get those features to enterprise after they have stabilized, been validated, and matured (the feature conveyor belt). If we don't limit the time we spend on enterprise-specific work, then we'll not have the time to deliver things like syntactic indexing, that will help with that broad appeal.

Thoughts? Questions? 

### Assistant - 2024-03-20 10:27:42

Hey Varun, thanks for reaching out! I understand the Graph team is navigating a challenging landscape with a hefty support load and the daunting task of prioritizing effectively.

We're aiming for around 20% of our capacity to be dedicated to enterprise-focused efforts or tasks specific to certain customers. This translates to roughly one day per week per team member for such tasks.

Collaboration with TS is key in determining which customer issues and feature needs are most critical. Aimee Menne and her team are enhancing our approach to escalation paths to make this process more seamless for the Graph team.

Beyond these priorities, I encourage the team to invest in initiatives that could reduce future workloads, like improving documentation. This not only aids Support and CE in addressing issues more independently but also enhances customer self-service capabilities, benefiting everyone involved.

If support tasks start to consistently exceed the 20% mark, please reach out. We can discuss adjusting our approach, possibly focusing more on changes that might reduce the need for escalations, or even revisiting our resource allocation.

Regarding the focus on spending the majority of our time on general product lovability and utility: our ultimate aim is a product that drives retention and growth. This involves creating features with broad appeal and usefulness. Targeting faster iteration environments, like dotcom for Code Search, allows us to refine features quickly before rolling them out to enterprise customers. Limiting enterprise-specific work ensures we have the bandwidth for significant improvements like syntactic indexing, enhancing the product's overall appeal.

I'm here for any further questions or to dive deeper into any points mentioned.
