Show me a sample chrome extension for modifying the color of google calendar events

### Assistant - 2023-03-29 16:23:56

Here's a sample Chrome extension code that modifies the color of Google Calendar events:

1. Create a new folder for your extension and create a manifest.json file with the following contents:

```
{
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "Google Calendar Event Colorizer",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "A Chrome extension that modifies the color of Google Calendar events.",
    "permissions": [
        "tabs",
        "https://www.google.com/calendar/*"
    ],
    "content_scripts": [
        {
            "matches": [
                "https://www.google.com/calendar/*"
            ],
            "js": ["content.js"]
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Create a content.js file in the same folder with the following contents:

```
function colorizeEvents() {
    let events = document.querySelectorAll(".fc-event");
    for (let i = 0; i < events.length; i++) {
        let color = getRandomColor(); // generate a random color
        events[i].style.backgroundColor = color;
    }
}

function getRandomColor() {
    let letters = "0123456789ABCDEF";
    let color = "#";
    for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random() * 16)];
    }
    return color;
}

colorizeEvents();

// listen for changes to the DOM and re-colorize events
let observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {
    mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {
        if (mutation.type === "childList" && mutation.addedNodes.length > 0) {
            colorizeEvents();
        }
    });
});
observer.observe(document.querySelector(".fc-view"), { childList: true });
```

3. Load the extension in Chrome by navigating to chrome://extensions and clicking "Load unpacked" and selecting the folder containing your manifest.json and content.js files.

4. Navigate to Google Calendar and you should see the colors of the events randomly changing. 

Note: This is just a sample implementation and it may not work perfectly in all situations. It's also worth noting that modifying the DOM of a website without the website's permission can be considered a violation of the website's terms of service, so use this code at your own risk.

how do I define icons in a manifest.json

### Assistant - 2023-03-29 16:28:51

You can define icons for your Chrome extension in the `manifest.json` file by adding an `"icons"` property that specifies the different sizes of icons you want to include. Here's an example:

```
{
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "My Extension",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "This is my extension.",
    "icons": {
        "16": "icon16.png",
        "32": "icon32.png",
        "48": "icon48.png",
        "128": "icon128.png"
    },
    ...
}
```

In this example, the `"icons"` property specifies four different sizes of icons (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128) and the corresponding image files (`icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png`). You can include as many or as few sizes as you want, but it's a good idea to include at least the most commonly used sizes (16x16 and 48x48).

Note that the image files must be included in your extension's directory and referenced relative to the `manifest.json` file. For example, if your `manifest.json` file and your image files are all in the same directory, you can reference them like in the example above.
