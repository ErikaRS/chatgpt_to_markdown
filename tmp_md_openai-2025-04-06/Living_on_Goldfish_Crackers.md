Living solely on goldfish crackers would not be healthy or sustainable. While they can be a tasty snack, they lack the necessary nutrients required for a balanced diet. A variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, proteins, and grains, is essential for maintaining overall health. If you have dietary concerns, consulting with a nutritionist or healthcare provider would be beneficial.
