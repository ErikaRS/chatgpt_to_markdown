Below is a draft message to two managers who report to me. I've asked them to scope out moving from quarterly to monthly releases. One manager, Peter, is working on doing a technical evaluation. He runs the Code Search product team. The other manager, Nelson, runs the releases team. He has been pushing strongly back against even investigating this option and at this point I've had to tell him that it's something he has to at least consider. Some of the conversations between him and me have gotten a bit heated.

The goal of the message is to inform them both about the priority of my request and make it crystal clear what I want from them. In particular, I want it to be clear that the scoping exercise doesn't need to go into the detail of fully defining a solution. It should go just deep enough to be able to trade off pros and cons. Although I want them to explore other options, the only feasible option on the table at the moment is moving our current process to monthly. 

I want the request to be as concise as possible while still being very very very explicit about what I expect.

Please critique this message given the goals stated above.

The message:
Hello @Nelson Araujo and @Peter Guy! I promised you both an update on my expectations around scoping increasing release velocity.

*Focus on velocity*
First, I want to add more detail about a conversation I mentioned to each of you. @sqs asked how we could increase the velocity and sense of urgency of work on Code Search. @csells and I gave a two part answer: 
- We need more frequent releases. It's hard to feel a sense of urgency when even if you finish work tomorrow, it's still months until customers can get their hands on it.
- We need a clear and present picture of our key metrics, like Cody has with the usage and lovability dashboards. (This one isn't relevant to this conversation and @Peter Guy up to speed, so I'll say no more about this for now.)

@sqs, @csells, and @beyang all agreed that getting more frequent releases is critical to helping the Search Suite team feel like they can iterate quickly. 

They did not specifically ask for us to prioritize increasing Code Search release velocity, but they were very happy to hear that discussions were already happening. This emphasizes the importance of us doing a feasibility analysis on getting more frequent releases.

*Feasibility analysis expectations*
Based on our meeting last week, we agreed that the next step was for @Peter Guy to investigate how feasible it is, from an Eng perspective, to take today's release process and go back to doing it monthly instead of quarterly. 

I also want to make sure that we are defining the problem clearly and documenting the tradeoffs of that option against other options (wait for the longer term solution, add a separate release channel). This document does not need to be exhaustive and it does not need to define a solution, just the problem and the tradeoffs. 

In particular I'd like it to include:
- Objectives of moving to more frequently releases
- Overview of the current release process, focusing on what makes it challenging
  - It would be useful to compare the current release process to cutting a patch release, the dotcom and S2 pushes. 
    - Note: The purpose of these comparison points is to understand the release landscape today, not to imply that we can adopt any of them as is.
- Very high level overview of the options we've considered so far
    - This should include the ones we dismissed but the description could be as simple as "Considered X but it is infeasible because of Y"
- More detailed overview of the costs of moving our current release process to monthly. 
- Recommendation of whether or not these costs are worth the benefit. 
- (Feel free to modify the structure as needed, including adding additional data. These are just the points I want to make sure are covered)

I have currently asked @Nelson Araujo to drive the creation of this document. However, if either of you feel like it would be more appropriate for @Peter Guy to drive this with @Nelson Araujoâ€™s team taking on more of a consulting role, then let's discuss that option, including what consultation @Peter Guy (and team) would need and how to time box it.

The draft message you have provided is quite clear in articulating your expectations and the need for both Peter and Nelson to collaborate on the feasibility analysis of increasing release velocity. Here are some suggestions to make it even more concise and explicit, ensuring it aligns with your goals:

1. **Directly Address Resistance**: Acknowledge that there have been different opinions about exploring the option of monthly releases without getting into specifics, but stress that this exploration is a directive that needs to be followed.

2. **Clear Division of Roles**: Explicitly state what you expect from each manager in this process. Nelson seems to have been tasked with documentation, but it's not clear what Peter's deliverables are.

3. **Emphasize the Scope of Work**: Reiterate that the analysis should be high-level and is about understanding the trade-offs, not creating a full solution.

4. **Stress on Timelines**: Include a clear deadline or timeframe for when you expect this preliminary scoping exercise to be completed.

Here's a revised version of your message with these points in mind:

Subject: Directive on Scoping for Increased Release Frequency

Hello Nelson and Peter,

I'm reaching out to clarify the immediate steps for our discussion on increasing release frequency for the Code Search product.

**Objective**: Our goal is to scope the feasibility of transitioning from quarterly to monthly releases. This does not require a detailed solution but a clear understanding of the trade-offs involved.

**Roles**:
- **Peter**: Please conduct a technical evaluation of our current release process to assess the feasibility of increasing the release cadence.
- **Nelson**: Given your experience with the releases team, I need you to document this evaluation, outlining the potential benefits and drawbacks.

**Key Points for the Document**:
- Objectives for more frequent releases
- Overview and challenges of the current release process
- Comparisons with other release processes within our organization (not as templates to adopt, but as data points for understanding our landscape)
- Summary of considered and dismissed options, with reasons for dismissal
- Cost implications of shifting to a monthly release cycle
- A preliminary recommendation on whether the trade-offs merit the increased cadence

**Structure**: Feel free to organize this information as you see fit, but ensure that the above points are addressed comprehensively.

**Collaboration**: Nelson, as you begin documenting, Peter and his team should provide the necessary technical details. If you both find that a reversal of roles (with Peter driving and Nelson consulting) is more efficient, I am open to that discussion.

**Deadline**: I expect a high-level analysis to be presented by [specific date].

I understand there have been diverse views on this matter, but it is essential that we explore this option thoroughly. This task is a priority, and I'm counting on your professional expertise and collaboration to achieve a balanced view that will inform our path forward.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this directive.

Best,
[Your Name]

This revision provides a direct and structured approach, outlining clear expectations and roles for both managers while also leaving room for adjustments based on their mutual agreement. It also directly addresses the prior resistance in a professional manner, affirming the necessity of the task at hand.

Feasibility analysis expectations
I know we still have different opinions about how important it is to do this feasibility analysis. I expect us to produce something which at least evaluates whether or not moving our quarterly release process to monthly is feasible and, if not, clearly articulates why. We may also consider other options. If it is reasonable to do so without too much disruption, I would like a high level recommendation by the end of next week. More below on what I mean by that.

Based on our meeting last week, we agreed that the next step was for @Peter Guy to investigate how feasible it is, from an Eng perspective, to take today's release process and go back to doing it monthly instead of quarterly. Evaluating technical feasibility is a prerequisite to deciding whether or not to keep going.

I also want to make sure that we are defining the problem clearly and documenting the tradeoffs of that option against other options (wait for the longer term solution, add a separate release channel). This document does not need to be exhaustive and it does not need to define a solution, just the problem and the tradeoffs. 

In particular I'd like it to include:

It would be useful to compare the current release process to cutting a patch release, the dotcom and S2 pushes.

Very high level overview of the options we've considered so far. 
This should include the ones we dismissed but the description could be as simple as "Considered X but it is infeasible because of Y"
More detailed overview of the costs of moving our current release process to monthly. 
This should include a summary of the non-eng problems we would need to solve, e.g., what it means for patch releases or sequential upgrades. 
This section does not need to include solutions to these problems. Starting by just listing out all of the problems and the current costs that we'd incur releasing more frequently is a good first step.
Recommendation of whether or not these costs are worth the benefit and, if not, how much those costs would need to be reduced to make this plausible.
E.g., "release would need to take less than X hours per release"
Note that, as in the previous bullet, this document does not need solutions. I just want to know the constraints we're working in.
(Feel free to modify the structure as needed, including adding additional data. These are just the points I want to make sure are covered)

I have currently asked @Nelson Araujo to drive the creation of this document. However, if either of you feel like it would be more appropriate for @Peter Guy to drive this with @Nelson Araujoâ€™s team taking on more of a consulting role, then let's discuss that option, including what consultation @Peter Guy (and team) would need and how to time box it.

Also, please let me know if getting something at this level of detail drafted by the end of next week is feasible. To reiterate, it doesn't need to solve the problem of moving to monthly releases, but it should be detailed enough to let us decide whether or not to keep pursuing this direction.

The revised message has a clear directive and effectively communicates the urgency and importance of the task. It also opens up the floor for a potential role reversal between Nelson and Peter, which is a good approach to fostering collaboration. However, the message can still be improved for brevity and clarity. Here are some critiques and suggestions:

1. **Brevity**: The message is quite lengthy, which may dilute the impact of the key points you want to make. Consider condensing where possible without losing essential details.

2. **Prioritization of Information**: The details about the background conversations and alignments with other leaders are important but can be made more concise to get to the action points quicker.

3. **Clarity of Deliverables**: The deliverables are mentioned, but they can be bulleted or listed more clearly so that the expectations stand out.

4. **Deadline Confirmation**: You ask for feasibility of the deadline towards the end. It might be better to move this up in the message to ensure it's not missed.

Here's a streamlined version of your message, considering the critiques above:

Subject: Urgent: Scoping for Monthly Release Feasibility

Hello Nelson and Peter,

Quick update and action items regarding our release cadence:

We're tasked with assessing the feasibility of shifting from quarterly to monthly releases for the Code Search product. This initiative, endorsed by @sqs, @csells, and @beyang, aims to boost our work velocity.

**Action Items**:
- **Peter**: Evaluate the technical feasibility of monthly releases.
- **Nelson**: Lead the documentation of Peter's findings, outlining the pros and cons.

**Expected Outcomes by end of next week**:
- Objectives for increasing release frequency.
- Comparison of current release process with other release models (patch releases, dotcom, and S2 pushes).
- High-level overview of options considered, including those dismissed with rationales.
- Detailed assessment of costs associated with shifting to monthly releases, including non-engineering implications.
- Preliminary recommendation on whether the benefits justify the costs or the cost reductions needed for feasibility.

The deliverable does not need to be exhaustive or solution-oriented but should enable a decision on whether to continue pursuing this direction.

**Role Adaptation**:
Should there be a need to adjust roles (Peter driving the documentation with Nelson consulting), please raise this as soon as possible, along with any necessary consultation requirements and considerations for time boxing.

**Feasibility Check**:
Is the end of next week a realistic deadline for a draft? This scoping exercise is a priority, and your prompt feedback on this timeline is essential.

I appreciate your cooperation and understanding that despite differing views, exploring this change is non-negotiable and crucial for our team's progress.

Thank you for your focused efforts on this matter.

Best,
[Your Name]

Hello @Nelson Araujo and @Peter Guy! I promised you both an update on my expectations around scoping increasing release velocity.

Focus on velocity
@sqs would like to see us increase the velocity and sense of urgency of work on Code Search. They agreed that we need more frequent releases. It's hard to feel a sense of urgency when even if you finish work tomorrow, it's still months until customers can get their hands on it. They did not declare monthly releases a mandate, but they were very happy to hear that we were already assessing feasibility. (Also, in exec team meeting, we got approval to sacrifice the 5.3 version number to testing.)

Feasibility analysis expectations
@Nelson Araujo and @Peter Guy, given this I want you to product an analysis which gives a cost benefit analysis of whether or not there is a feasible path for moving from quarterly to monthly releases. The deliverable does not need to be exhaustive or solution-oriented but should enable a decision on whether to continue pursuing this direction.

Expected next steps:
Peter: Evaluate the technical feasibility of doing our current release process monthly
Nelson: Document the problem we are trying to solve and the tradeoffs of moving to a monthly release (more details below)
If either of you think Peter should also drive the document, please raise this as soon as possible so we can discuss what consulting is needed from the Releases team.

Timeline:
I would like to have this high level analysis by the end of next week (Nov 10). If that is not feasible, please recommend ways we could cut scope to hit that date or a more feasible date. 

Questions the document should answer
What is the business objective of moving to more frequent releases? What are the problems we are trying to solve and why would monthly releases help?
Since I've been the one pushing this as a priority, I can write this part once we have the doc. 
What is the work involved in the current release process and how much manual work does it involve? How does cutting a full release differ from the patch process? From pushing do dotcom and S2? 
What options have we considered, including those we have dismissed (and why)?
What are the costs and challenges associated with moving our current release process to monthly? This should include non-eng problems. 
What is your preliminary recommendation on whether or not the benefits are worth the costs? How much would the costs need to be reduced to make the tradeoff worthwhile?

Note that the document does not need to provide details on how we would solve the problems caused by moving to a more monthly release. That can be a follow up if we decide this direction is worth pursuing. 

### Assistant - 2023-11-01 17:27:39

This revised version is more concise and to the point, which is positive. It also clarifies the expectations and the timeline, which is crucial for actionable follow-through. Here are some points to consider for further refinement:

1. **Title**: Adding a subject line to the email would immediately indicate the topic of urgency and focus the recipientsâ€™ attention.

2. **Introduction**: Itâ€™s good that you've reduced the background information, but you could streamline it further. Directly stating that leadership supports an investigation into increased release frequency sets the stage for why the analysis is crucial.

3. **Clarity of Task Ownership**: Clearly indicating which manager is responsible for what tasks is done well here, but consider reinforcing the need for collaborative evaluation.

4. **Business Objective**: Mentioning that you will contribute to defining the business objectives is a great way to show involvement and guidance.

5. **Document Structure**: You have clearly listed the questions that the document should answer. It might be more effective to bullet these to visually break up the text for ease of reading.

6. **Feedback on Timeline**: Asking for feedback on the feasibility of the timeline is important, and you have done this well by suggesting alternatives if the deadline is not attainable.

Based on these points, here's a possible revision:

**Subject**: Urgent: High-Level Analysis for Monthly Release Feasibility Due Nov 10

Hello @Nelson Araujo and @Peter Guy,

In alignment with leadershipâ€™s interest in accelerating the velocity and urgency of our Code Search work, our task is to assess the potential shift to monthly releases.

**Task Allocation**:
- **Peter**: Conduct a technical evaluation of adapting our current quarterly release process to a monthly cycle.
- **Nelson**: Lead the charge in documenting the challenges and trade-offs of such a change.

**Deliverables for a high-level analysis by Nov 10**:
- **Business Objectives**: I'll articulate the core objectives and problems we aim to solve with more frequent releases.
- **Release Process Workload**: Detail the labor and steps in our current process compared to alternative methods (patch releases, dotcom, S2).
- **Options and Costs**: Summarize considered strategies, including dismissed ones with rationales, and outline the costs and challenges of a monthly release cycle.
- **Preliminary Recommendation**: Provide an initial judgment on cost-benefit viability and thresholds for cost reduction that might justify the shift.

This analysis does not require solutions to the problems it identifies. If the direction is deemed worthwhile, weâ€™ll tackle solutions subsequently.

**Timeline Consideration**:
If the Nov 10 deadline poses challenges, suggest scope adjustments or propose a more realistic timeline promptly.

**Collaboration**:
Should role adjustments be necessary for efficiency, please communicate this immediately to optimize team collaboration.

Your prompt and detailed analysis will guide our strategic decision on this pivotal change. Thank you for your dedication to this significant initiative.

Best,
[Your Name]
