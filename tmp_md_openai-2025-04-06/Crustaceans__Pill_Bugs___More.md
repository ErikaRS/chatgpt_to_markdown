Isopods are a group of crustaceans that include species found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. They belong to the order Isopoda and are characterized by their flattened bodies and rigid, segmented exoskeletons. Isopods have seven pairs of legs and two pairs of antennae. Common examples include pill bugs (or roly-polies), which are terrestrial isopods often found in gardens, and various marine species found in the ocean. They play important roles in ecosystems, often acting as decomposers that help break down organic matter.
