Sketch out a PRD for an AI coating tool called the director. The tagline is: it is the assistant. You are the director. 

The idea of the director is that developers as they are coding have a plan in mind. But that plan is often implicit, scattered across open files and opened tabs, notes written down here and there, pointers in issues. The director allows you to bring that plan in one place and utilize AI to expand it, so fill in the gaps, and even execute the details when you feel confident that it can do so. 

The UI would be something like a super powerful to-do list embedded in your IDE. It would have a list of goals which can have arbitrarily nested sub goals. They could be reordered or edited. At any level of the hierarchy, the user, the director, can ask the llm fill in the next level of detail. And when there's something fine-grained enough, a judgment which ultimately lies in the human, but which the LLM will give suggestions about when it is ready for, then with the push of a button, the human director could ask the lll to run that step which will generate code or do other actions the llm isn't able to do.

#### 1. **Overview**
Developers often have a clear plan in mind while coding, but that plan can become scattered across various files, notes, tabs, and issues. This fragmentation slows down development and makes it harder to keep track of overall progress. The Director is an AI-powered tool that helps developers bring their plans into one place, leverage AI to expand on ideas, and execute detailed tasks when ready. The tool acts as a powerful to-do list within an IDE, allowing for a structured, collaborative flow between human direction and AI-generated assistance.

#### 2. **Objectives**
- **Consolidate the developer’s plan:** Provide a central space for developers to organize their goals and steps.
- **Utilize AI to fill gaps:** Allow developers to request AI to expand tasks or suggest steps.
- **Enable AI execution:** Once a plan reaches a fine-grained level, enable the AI to execute specific steps or generate code, guided by user judgment.
- **Seamless IDE integration:** Make the tool an embedded experience within the developer’s workflow, reducing the friction between planning and execution.

#### 3. **Key Features**

##### 3.1 **Hierarchical Goal Setting**
- **Goal Creation:** Users can create high-level goals that break down into nested sub-goals.
- **Reordering and Editing:** Goals and sub-goals can be reordered or edited as priorities shift or additional insights are gained.
- **Contextual Structuring:** Developers can structure these goals based on their work, project files, or feature requirements, creating a living plan inside their IDE.

##### 3.2 **AI-Powered Expansion**
- **Detail Generation:** At any level of the hierarchy, users can request the AI to expand upon an item. For example, they can ask the AI to fill in the next steps for a vague goal.
- **Gap Filling:** The AI can suggest missing pieces, such as tests, optimizations, or architecture decisions, making the plan more robust.

##### 3.3 **AI-Assisted Execution**
- **Ready-to-Execute Status:** When a goal or sub-goal is sufficiently fine-grained, the AI will suggest that it is ready to execute.
- **Execution by AI:** Upon approval, the AI can generate code, automate repetitive tasks, or perform system interactions like dependency installation or refactoring.
- **User Control:** The final decision to execute a task lies with the user (the Director), preserving human oversight over the coding process.

##### 3.4 **Seamless IDE Integration**
- **Embedded To-Do List UI:** The Director functions as a robust, interactive to-do list directly within the IDE, maintaining the user’s context while working.
- **Contextual Code Interaction:** The Director links goals to specific lines of code, files, or broader feature sets, enabling easy navigation between tasks and codebase areas.

##### 3.5 **AI Judgment Suggestions**
- **Context-Aware Recommendations:** The AI can make suggestions on when goals are sufficiently detailed for execution, offering guidance while keeping final authority with the user.
- **Granularity Controls:** Developers can control the granularity of the task execution, choosing whether to handle low-level details manually or allow the AI to step in.

#### 4. **User Flow**

1. **Creating a Goal:**
   - Developer writes a high-level goal (e.g., "Implement user authentication").
   - Adds sub-goals (e.g., "Set up login form," "Implement backend authentication").
  
2. **Asking for AI Assistance:**
   - Developer selects "Implement backend authentication" and asks the AI to fill in the next steps.
   - The AI generates suggestions (e.g., "Define user schema," "Write authentication service," "Set up token-based auth").

3. **Editing and Reordering Goals:**
   - The developer refines the AI's suggestions, reordering or editing them to fit their workflow.
  
4. **AI-Generated Code:**
   - When “Write authentication service” is deemed sufficiently detailed, the AI suggests that the task is ready to execute.
   - The developer clicks to approve, and the AI generates the necessary code for the authentication service.
  
5. **Refining or Rolling Back:**
   - The developer reviews the code, making manual edits if necessary or rolling back the AI-generated task if it does not meet requirements.

#### 5. **Target Audience**
- **Software Developers:** Full-stack, backend, and frontend developers who work on complex projects with scattered goals.
- **Tech Leads:** Individuals responsible for managing development workflows and ensuring timely feature delivery.
- **Engineering Teams:** Cross-functional teams working on large-scale projects requiring task and goal structuring.

#### 6. **User Benefits**
- **Efficiency:** Centralizes the plan in one place, removing the need to switch between tabs, notes, and issues.
- **AI Augmentation:** Enables developers to delegate tedious or complex tasks to AI, speeding up development.
- **Structured Progress:** Encourages a more structured approach to coding, with clear goals and actionable steps.

#### 7. **Success Metrics**
- **Adoption Rate:** Number of users actively integrating The Director into their IDE workflow.
- **Task Automation Rate:** Percentage of tasks successfully completed using AI-powered execution.
- **Productivity Increase:** Reduction in the average time developers spend on task management and execution.
- **User Satisfaction:** High Net Promoter Score (NPS) among developers indicating satisfaction with the workflow improvements.

#### 8. **Risks & Assumptions**
- **Risk:** Users may distrust AI-generated code execution without full oversight.
  - **Mitigation:** Emphasize human control at all stages with suggestions, review options, and rollback capabilities.
  
- **Risk:** Integration with IDEs may be complex and prone to performance bottlenecks.
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on lightweight embedding and seamless interaction with existing workflows.
  
- **Assumption:** Developers will adopt the tool if it significantly reduces planning friction and manual code generation.

**Next Steps:**
- Conduct user research and validation with developers.
- Develop MVP focusing on hierarchical goal-setting and basic AI-generated task expansions.
- Begin initial IDE integrations with popular IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.).

### 1. **Junior Developer's Perspective**

**Praise:**
- **Guidance through Complexity:** "The Director really helps me break down big tasks into manageable steps. When I get stuck or don’t know what to do next, the AI’s suggestions are super helpful. It feels like a mentor giving me a nudge in the right direction."
- **Improves Confidence:** "I sometimes feel unsure if my approach is the right one, but with the AI filling in gaps or suggesting the next step, I feel more confident that I’m not missing anything important."
- **Saves Time on Repetitive Tasks:** "The ability to let the AI execute certain tasks, like generating boilerplate code or automating repetitive work, is a lifesaver. It helps me focus more on learning the important parts."

**Criticism:**
- **Over-Reliance on AI Suggestions:** "Sometimes, I worry that I’m relying too much on the AI to make decisions for me. I’m not sure if I’m learning as much as I could be since the AI is doing part of the work."
- **Lack of Explanation:** "The AI often gives suggestions or code snippets, but it doesn’t always explain *why* it’s doing something a certain way. I’d love more context so I can learn from it, instead of just accepting it."
- **Confusing Hierarchies:** "Breaking tasks into sub-goals feels useful, but sometimes I end up with a huge list of nested tasks and I’m not sure what I should prioritize. The tool makes things feel more organized, but also overwhelming when there’s too much going on."

### 2. **Experienced Individual Contributor's Perspective**

**Praise:**
- **Fills in Gaps Efficiently:** "I really appreciate the AI’s ability to take care of the smaller, more tedious parts of my work. It helps me avoid getting bogged down in details, so I can focus on the bigger picture of my implementation."
- **Flexible Goal Management:** "The flexibility of The Director in allowing me to reorder and refine tasks on the fly fits really well with my workflow. It feels less rigid than other project management tools I’ve tried."
- **Time Saver on Busy Days:** "When I’m juggling multiple projects, The Director’s ability to keep all my goals in one place saves me from context switching and forgetting important steps. It acts like a to-do list on steroids."

**Criticism:**
- **AI Doesn’t Always Get It Right:** "The AI suggestions are good for the basics, but it sometimes struggles with more complex tasks. I find myself having to rewrite the generated code fairly often, which can feel like I’m just wasting time."
- **Inconsistent Code Quality:** "Sometimes the code the AI generates feels sloppy or not up to the standards I’d expect. It doesn’t always follow best practices or the conventions I use, so I still have to do a lot of cleanup."
- **Too Much Task Management:** "The hierarchical structure can become cumbersome. I often spend too much time organizing and re-organizing tasks, which distracts me from the actual coding. It feels like I’m project-managing myself instead of just coding."

---

### 3. **Team Lead’s Perspective**

**Praise:**
- **Supports Delegation:** "The Director gives me a great way to organize tasks for my team. I can break down larger goals into manageable pieces and even use AI to help them fill in the details, which keeps things moving without my constant oversight."
- **Clarity Across Projects:** "Having a visual, goal-oriented structure inside the IDE helps everyone on the team stay aligned. When the AI suggests tasks or steps, it speeds up the process of fleshing out vague objectives into actionable items."
- **Helps Maintain Productivity:** "When team members are stuck, I can point them to the AI for suggestions. It ensures that the team doesn’t get blocked as often and that we’re still progressing even when I’m not around to answer every question."

**Criticism:**
- **Limited for Advanced Tasks:** "The AI-generated tasks are often useful for junior developers or routine work, but when it comes to more strategic or high-level decision-making, it’s not very helpful. I still need to manually review or adjust a lot."
- **Creates Overhead in Tracking:** "While the nested goal structure is great for individuals, managing it for an entire team can feel like overkill. We already use other project management tools, and duplicating this process inside the IDE sometimes feels redundant."
- **Execution Risks:** "Allowing the AI to execute code is a cool idea, but I’m hesitant to use it much. I prefer my team to have hands-on control when it comes to writing and reviewing code, and I worry about the AI making mistakes that could be hard to track down later."

---

**Summary:**
- **Junior developers** appreciate The Director for its guidance and confidence-building but struggle with over-reliance on AI and understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated suggestions.
- **Experienced individual contributors** value the tool for its time-saving and flexible task management but express frustrations with inconsistent AI-generated code quality and the overhead of managing tasks.
- **Team leads** see the benefit in delegation and keeping projects organized but find the tool limited for advanced tasks, redundant compared to existing project management tools, and cautious about the AI’s ability to execute code correctly.
