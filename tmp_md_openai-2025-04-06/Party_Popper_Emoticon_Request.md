Need a party popper emoticon thatâ€™s pointing the opposite direction and photonegative.

There isn't an official party popper emoji in the photonegative or pointing the opposite direction, but you could use a combination of text-based symbols to mimic that effect. Here's an approximation:

**Photonegative style:**
```
ðŸŽ‰
```

For a text-based version pointing the opposite direction:
```
<|Â°
```

Unfortunately, emoji customization for orientation and color isn't available on most platforms. Would you like me to generate an image that represents your request visually?
