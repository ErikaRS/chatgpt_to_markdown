Make this more concise: 
Thanks for all the great questions. Some thoughts:
Release production vs release adoption: 
We definitely should track release adoption, and I appreciate the work from the analytics team. Thanks @Kelsey Brown for pointing out more we can do!
We do not expect every customer to upgrade to every monthly release. In fact, my expectations is that Cloud customers will be the only ones who do. However, as a larger percentage of our customer base is on Cloud, that's still enough for us to get more frequent feedback. 
That said, I would love to get to the point where upgrading was easy and reliable enough for self-hosted customers that customers could upgrade monthly as long as their internal processes support it. 
Having monthly releases will also allow customers who are motivated to upgrade to a particular release the opportunity to do so. We often get issues reported for things we've actually fixed but which were not considered appropriate for a patch release. In those cases, we end up telling our customers they have to wait months before they can get that fix.
Major versions & support requirements: 
We will continue to associate the version numbers with marketing launches (details). Understanding if/how that will impact support is one of the things we need to work out by the 23rd.

Thank you for your insightful questions. Here are my condensed thoughts:

- **Release Adoption vs. Production**: Tracking release adoption is essential, and I'm grateful for the analytics team's efforts. Special thanks to @Kelsey Brown for highlighting areas for improvement.
- **Upgrade Expectations**: Not all customers are expected to upgrade every month; this is more realistic for Cloud customers. As they form a larger part of our base, their feedback from frequent upgrades is valuable.
- **Upgrade Process**: Our goal is to make upgrades easy and reliable enough that even self-hosted customers can consider monthly updates if it aligns with their internal processes.
- **Monthly Releases**: These releases not only address issues that cannot wait for a patch but also offer eager customers the chance to upgrade sooner.
- **Major Versions and Support**: We'll keep linking version numbers with marketing launches and need to clarify the impact on support by the 23rd.
