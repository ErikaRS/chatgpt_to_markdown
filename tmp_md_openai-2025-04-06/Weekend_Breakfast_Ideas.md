I am looking for a weekend breakfast idea that is quick but feels a bit more interesting than weekday cereal. The kids are tired of scones and pancakes. What are some ideas?

Certainly! Here are some weekend breakfast ideas that are a departure from the usual scones and pancakes:

1. **Breakfast Tacos:** Scrambled eggs, sautéed vegetables, and a sprinkle of cheese inside a soft tortilla. Add some salsa or guacamole on the side.

2. **Egg Muffins:** Whisk together eggs, diced vegetables, and cheese, then pour into muffin tins and bake. They're like mini frittatas!

3. **French Toast Sticks:** Slice bread into sticks, dip in an egg-milk-cinnamon mixture, and pan-fry. Serve with maple syrup or yogurt for dipping.

4. **Breakfast Quesadillas:** Fill tortillas with scrambled eggs, cheese, and optional additions like cooked bacon or sautéed veggies. Cook until crispy and cut into wedges.

5. **Smoothie Bowls:** Blend fruits, yogurt, and a splash of milk or juice until smooth. Pour into bowls and top with granola, nuts, seeds, and sliced fruit.

6. **Breakfast Pizza:** Use a pre-made pizza base or flatbread. Top with a light layer of tomato sauce, scrambled eggs, breakfast meats, and cheese. Bake until golden.

7. **Savory Oatmeal:** Cook oats with chicken or vegetable broth instead of milk or water. Top with a poached egg, sautéed mushrooms, spinach, and a sprinkle of cheese.

8. **Stuffed Breakfast Peppers:** Hollow out bell peppers and fill with a mixture of scrambled eggs, cooked sausage, diced tomatoes, and cheese. Bake until the peppers are tender.

9. **Bagel Sandwich:** Spread cream cheese on a toasted bagel, then layer with smoked salmon, red onion slices, capers, and a sprinkle of dill.

10. **Chia Seed Pudding:** Mix chia seeds with milk and a touch of sweetener. Let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, top with fruits, nuts, and a drizzle of honey.

Remember to adjust portion sizes and ingredients based on your kids' preferences. These breakfasts can be made more interesting by letting the kids help prepare or customize their dishes. Enjoy your weekend breakfast!

Of course! Here are some sweet breakfast options that feel special for a weekend treat:

1. **Breakfast Banana Splits:** Halve a banana lengthwise and top with Greek yogurt, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, fresh berries, and a sprinkle of granola or chopped nuts.

2. **Stuffed French Toast:** Make a sandwich with slices of bread and a filling of cream cheese and jam or Nutella. Dip in egg batter and cook until golden. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

3. **Fruit & Cream Cheese Breakfast Pastries:** Use store-bought puff pastry. Cut into squares, add a dollop of cream cheese and some sliced fruit, then bake until golden.

4. **Ricotta Pancakes:** Add ricotta cheese to your regular pancake batter for an extra fluffy texture. Serve with lemon zest and a drizzle of honey.

5. **Chocolate Chip Breakfast Cookies:** Make a batch using oats, mashed bananas, a bit of peanut or almond butter, and chocolate chips. Bake and serve.

6. **Crepes:** Thin pancakes that you can fill with whipped cream, fruits, Nutella, or jam. Roll up and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

7. **Dutch Baby Pancake:** A baked pancake that puffs up in the oven. Serve with powdered sugar, fresh fruit, and a squeeze of lemon.

8. **Brioche or Challah French Toast:** Using brioche or challah bread makes for an extra rich and decadent French toast. Top with berries and syrup.

9. **Breakfast Parfait:** Layer yogurt with granola and fruit in a clear glass or jar. Drizzle with honey or maple syrup.

10. **Cinnamon Roll Waffles:** Make or buy cinnamon roll dough. Press individual rolls in a waffle iron for a quick twist on the classic cinnamon roll.

Each of these options can be made even more fun with added toppings, drizzles, or mix-ins. Let your kids choose their favorites and help in the preparation for a memorable weekend breakfast!
