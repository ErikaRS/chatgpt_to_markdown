You shouldn’t act on every idea that occurs to you. When we test our dreams with our physical bodies, we call this sleepwalking. Chronic sleepwalkers risk serious injury because the body isn’t meant to enact fleeting thoughts and visions in the real world. This same principle applies to innovation in large corporations.
When large companies try to test new ideas using their established processes, technologies, or infrastructure, they run the risk of sleepwalking. Their stable, efficiency-focused systems are not a good match for the rapid experimentation required for innovation. If they ignore this gap and try to innovate on a substrate optimized for efficiency, it can lead to walking blindly into chaos and self-destruction. This is not just an operational limitation; it's a fundamental structural flaw. This is the realm of the innovator’s dilemma.
Where does this gap come from? In the grand tapestry of survival, nature has painted two distinct strategies: prolific r-selection, where life blooms in abundance with the hope that a few will endure, and prudent K-selection, where quality trumps quantity, nurturing a select few to thrive.
Humans, as K-selected beings, embody this careful approach. As a result, we move much of our risk taking from real-world trials into our minds. Within the confines of our minds, we simulate potential realities, envisioning the outcomes of our choices. This ability to mentally rehearse allows us to foresee pitfalls and refine our strategies before venturing into the tangible world.
Ideas within a large corporation have a similar K-selected form. Within their standard processes, they only have the ability to nurture a small number of ideas. Yet the ability to simulate, to use a careful rehearsal to test possibility, doesn’t come as naturally in the sort of large, multi-agent system that a large company embodies. 
Large corporations must tread carefully in the realm of new ideas. New ideas require experimentation, the sort of r-selected inefficiency where it’s okay if some (or most) attempts end in failure. Yet their vast infrastructure, designed for stability and efficiency, becomes a cumbersome obstacle when faced with rapid experimentation.
A common failure mode is when large companies try to fit innovation within their current processes. This form of corporate sleepwalking leads to situations where experiments become expensive and burdened with the pressure of success. This corporate sleepwalking is a dangerous and inefficient way to innovate. 
To escape this trap, large corporations must wake up and embrace a different mindset when testing new concepts. As we learn from the innovator’s dilemma, rather than trying to innovate within the boundaries of their core infrastructure, they need to create separate, nimble environments—labs or beta initiatives—that operate independently. These spaces become the fertile soil where ideas can rapidly sprout, be tested, and––perhaps most importantly––wither away without endangering the core business. These "r-selected substrates" provide the freedom and flexibility for experimentation, free from the constraints of K-selected corporate systems. 
These experimental havens do not only benefit experimentation. They give companies the freedom to dream while keeping their core business stable and intact. Just as our thoughts serve as the proving grounds for our actions, these experimental spaces act as the crucible where ideas are forged and refined. These r-selected crucibles must remain isolated, operating independently from the "body" of the K-selected company. Only ideas that have survived the crucible of experimentation should get the deep nurturing of the stable environment. 
We, as humans, allow our ideas and dreams to experiment and perish in our minds so that we may endure. Large companies must do the same—keep ideas in r-selected spaces, and avoid forcing them through the rigid body of the organization too early. Sleepwalking toward destruction is to be avoided—both for individuals and organizations alike.

Here's a revised version of your essay, focusing on clarity, flow, and coherence while maintaining the original message:

You shouldn’t act on every idea that comes to mind. When we test our dreams with our physical bodies, we call it sleepwalking. Chronic sleepwalkers risk serious injury because the body isn’t designed to act out fleeting thoughts in the real world. The same principle applies to innovation in large corporations.

When big companies try to test new ideas using their existing processes, technologies, or infrastructure, they risk sleepwalking. Their stable, efficiency-driven systems are not equipped for the rapid experimentation that innovation requires. Ignoring this gap and trying to innovate on a platform optimized for efficiency can lead to blindly walking into chaos and self-destruction. This isn’t just an operational limitation—it's a fundamental structural flaw. This is the realm of the innovator’s dilemma.

Where does this gap come from? Nature offers two distinct survival strategies: prolific r-selection, where life blooms abundantly in the hope that a few will endure, and prudent K-selection, where quality trumps quantity, nurturing a select few to thrive.

As K-selected beings, humans embody this careful, selective approach. We move much of our risk-taking from the physical world into the mind. In our minds, we simulate potential realities, envisioning the outcomes of different choices. This ability to mentally rehearse allows us to foresee pitfalls and refine strategies before we take action.

Ideas in a large corporation follow a similar K-selected pattern. Their established processes are only capable of nurturing a small number of ideas. However, large organizations, being complex, multi-agent systems, don’t naturally excel at mental rehearsals or simulations the way individuals do.

Corporations must tread carefully when pursuing new ideas. Innovation requires experimentation, which is inherently inefficient, akin to the r-selected strategy where failure is an acceptable part of the process. However, the vast infrastructure of large companies, designed for stability and efficiency, becomes a cumbersome obstacle when faced with the need for rapid experimentation.

A common failure mode occurs when corporations try to force innovation within their existing processes. This corporate sleepwalking leads to costly experiments weighed down by the pressure to succeed. It's a dangerous and inefficient way to approach innovation.

To break free from this trap, corporations must embrace a different mindset when testing new concepts. As the innovator’s dilemma suggests, instead of attempting to innovate within their core infrastructure, they need to create separate, agile environments—labs or beta initiatives—that operate independently. These spaces provide fertile ground where ideas can sprout quickly, be tested, and—most importantly—fail without jeopardizing the core business. These “r-selected substrates” offer the freedom and flexibility necessary for experimentation, free from the constraints of K-selected corporate systems.

These experimental havens serve more than just innovation. They allow companies to dream freely while keeping their core operations stable. Just as our minds serve as a proving ground for our actions, these experimental spaces act as crucibles where ideas are forged and refined. These r-selected crucibles must remain isolated, functioning independently from the "body" of the K-selected company. Only ideas that survive this rigorous testing should be nurtured within the stable environment.

We, as individuals, allow our ideas to experiment and fail in our minds so that we may endure. Large corporations must do the same—keep ideas in r-selected spaces, and avoid forcing them through the rigid structure of the organization too soon. Sleepwalking toward destruction is a peril for both individuals and organizations alike.

Here's a more concise version of your essay, focusing on clarity and removing redundant points while keeping the original tone and language intact:

---

Not every idea should be acted upon. When we test our dreams with our bodies, we call it sleepwalking—dangerous because the body isn’t meant to act on fleeting thoughts. The same principle applies to innovation in large corporations.

When large companies test new ideas using established processes, they risk sleepwalking. Their efficiency-driven systems aren't suited for the rapid experimentation innovation needs. Ignoring this gap and attempting to innovate on a system optimized for stability leads to chaos and self-destruction. This is a core issue of the innovator’s dilemma.

Where does this gap come from? Nature uses two survival strategies: prolific r-selection, where abundance increases the chances of survival, and careful K-selection, where quality nurtures a few to thrive.

Humans, as K-selected beings, move much of our risk-taking into the mind, mentally rehearsing potential outcomes to refine strategies before acting. Large corporations, with their complex systems, struggle with this mental rehearsal, as their processes only nurture a few ideas.

Innovation, however, requires an r-selected approach where failure is acceptable. Yet, corporate infrastructure, designed for efficiency, becomes an obstacle to rapid experimentation.

A common failure is when corporations force innovation into their existing processes. This corporate sleepwalking leads to costly experiments weighed down by the pressure of success—a dangerous way to innovate.

To avoid this trap, companies need separate, nimble environments—labs or beta initiatives—operating independently from their core infrastructure. These "r-selected substrates" provide the freedom for experimentation without endangering the main business. Ideas can sprout, be tested, and fail freely, ensuring only those that survive are nurtured within stable systems.

These experimental spaces allow corporations to dream while maintaining stability. Just as we mentally test ideas before acting, corporations need isolated spaces where ideas can be forged and refined. Only those that survive this crucible should be integrated into the core business.

We, as individuals, let our ideas experiment and fail in our minds to ensure we thrive. Corporations must do the same—keep ideas in r-selected spaces, and avoid forcing them into the organization too early. Sleepwalking into destruction should be avoided—whether for individuals or organizations.

This streamlined version keeps the core ideas intact while reducing repetition and excess details.
