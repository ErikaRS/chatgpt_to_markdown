What can we Make with sour cream?

### Assistant - 2025-04-06 13:27:07

Great question! Let’s dive into what you can make with sour cream based on your **personal recipe index** and the **common meals** list.

First, I’ll unpack the recipes.zip and look through your recipes to find any that use sour cream. Then I’ll cross-reference those with meals you commonly enjoy to highlight familiar favorites.

Give me a sec while I pull that together.

```unknown
from zipfile import ZipFile
import os

# Unzip the recipes.zip file
recipes_zip_path = "/mnt/data/recipes.zip"
extract_path = "/mnt/data/recipes"

with ZipFile(recipes_zip_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(extract_path)

# List extracted files for review
extracted_files = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(extract_path):
    for file in files:
        extracted_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))

extracted_files[:10]  # Show the first few to get a sense of the structure
```

The recipes are organized in folders under categories like **side dishes** and **Nana’s kitchen**. Now I’ll search through all these recipes to find any that mention **sour cream** in their ingredients or instructions.

```unknown
import re

# Search for "sour cream" in recipe files
sour_cream_recipes = []

for file_path in extracted_files:
    if file_path.endswith(".html"):
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
            content = f.read().lower()
            if "sour cream" in content:
                sour_cream_recipes.append(file_path)

sour_cream_recipes

Nice! Here are recipes from your personal collection that use **sour cream**:

1. **Sous Vide Cheesy Mashed Potatoes** – creamy, indulgent, and likely a hit as a side.
2. **Nanny’s Kugel** – a classic Jewish comfort dish.
3. **Potato Latkes** – crispy and perfect with a dollop of sour cream.
4. **Cheese Bagelach** – likely a baked treat, possibly savory.
5. **Risotto Variants** – some versions may incorporate sour cream for richness.
6. **Cornbread with Roast Tomato and Corn Salsa** – may use sour cream for tang and moisture.
7. **Kugel (another variation)** – rich, baked noodle or potato dish.
8. **Beef Stroganoff** – a classic main where sour cream is key to the creamy sauce.

Want me to check which of these overlap with your frequently eaten meals? Or would you like a recommendation based on the type of meal you're planning (like a side, main, or something for a special occasion)?
