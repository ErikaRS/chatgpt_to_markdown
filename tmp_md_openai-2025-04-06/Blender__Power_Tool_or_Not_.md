A power tool is typically defined as a tool that is powered by an external power source, often electricity. Given that a blender is indeed powered by electricity (or occasionally battery), it does fit this broad definition. However, power tools are typically associated with construction, woodworking, and other industrial or manual labor contexts. Blenders are primarily used in food preparation and are generally categorized as a kitchen appliance.

**Arguments for considering a blender as a power tool:**

1. **Electrically Powered**: Blenders are usually powered by electricity or batteries, much like traditional power tools such as drills, saws, or grinders.

2. **Mechanical Function**: Blenders perform mechanical work, similar to traditional power tools. They use their power source to create rotational force, which is then used to blend or mix ingredients.

3. **Tool Definition**: If we take the definition of a tool as something that aids in accomplishing a task, a blender can be seen as a tool that assists in the task of food preparation.

**Arguments against considering a blender as a power tool:**

1. **Contextual Use**: Power tools are generally associated with construction, manual labor, or industrial usage, which does not match the typical usage of a blender.

2. **Categorization**: In stores and product catalogs, blenders are often grouped under kitchen appliances rather than power tools. This reflects a general perception of blenders as distinct from power tools.

3. **Safety Regulations and Standards**: Power tools are often subject to different safety regulations and standards than kitchen appliances. For example, power tools may need to withstand certain environmental conditions that kitchen appliances do not.

The commonly held view is that a blender is not considered a power tool. This is largely due to the contextual use of the device, its categorization in stores and catalogs, and different safety regulations. While it shares some features with power tools, such as being powered by electricity and performing mechanical work, the contexts in which blenders are used significantly differ from those of traditional power tools. They are predominantly seen as a kitchen appliance used for food preparation.
