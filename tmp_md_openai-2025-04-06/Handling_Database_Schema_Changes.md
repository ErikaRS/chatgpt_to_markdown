Complex systems handle changing database schemas between versions through careful management and well-defined processes to ensure system reliability and data integrity while minimizing downtime. Here are several common approaches:

### 1. **Backward and Forward Compatibility**
   - **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure that new code can work with the existing database schema. This allows deploying new versions of the application without immediately breaking compatibility with the previous schema.
   - **Forward Compatibility**: Make the old version of the code work with the new schema. This helps in minimizing risks when rolling back or during phased rollouts.

### 2. **Schema Versioning and Migration Scripts**
   - Changes to a database schema are typically managed with **migration scripts** that represent each modification as a versioned change (e.g., using tools like Liquibase, Flyway, or Alembic).
   - Each schema change (e.g., adding columns, altering data types, etc.) has an associated migration script that runs in a controlled sequence. Migrations are versioned and can be applied or rolled back if needed.

### 3. **Phased Schema Changes (Expand and Contract Pattern)**
   - **Expand Phase**: Modify the database schema to support both the new and old versions. This usually involves adding new columns, tables, or indices, and ensuring that both old and new code can run concurrently.
   - **Contract Phase**: Once the new code is fully deployed and stable, deprecate or remove old parts of the schema. This can include dropping deprecated columns or constraints that are no longer used.

   This pattern ensures a smooth transition by allowing for backward compatibility and gradual adoption.

### 4. **Feature Flags and Conditional Code**
   - **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to selectively enable new features that depend on the updated schema. This allows the team to gradually enable new functionality and monitor its impact.
   - **Conditional Code Paths**: Code may include logic to handle both old and new schema states, which can be especially useful if deployment happens gradually or requires a rollback.

### 5. **Blue-Green Deployment and Shadow Deployment**
   - **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploy a new version of the system (with a new schema) in parallel with the existing version. Switch traffic over once validated. This minimizes downtime but requires sufficient infrastructure to support two versions concurrently.
   - **Shadow Deployment**: Run the new version alongside the old one without user impact, often for testing purposes. Shadow deployments can reveal potential compatibility issues between old and new schemas.

### 6. **Database Triggers and Views**
   - **Triggers**: Use database triggers temporarily to keep multiple versions of tables in sync. For example, if a new column is added, a trigger can populate it based on changes to the old column until the transition is complete.
   - **Views**: Create views to abstract complex changes. For instance, when splitting a table, views can maintain compatibility by providing an interface that resembles the old schema.

### 7. **Data Backfilling and Validation Jobs**
   - When introducing a new schema that requires additional data, **backfill jobs** are often run to populate the new fields based on existing data. These backfill jobs can be performed incrementally to avoid excessive load.
   - **Validation jobs** might be employed post-migration to verify that data in the new schema is consistent and complete.

### 8. **API Versioning**
   - When the database changes require modifications to how clients interact with the system, **API versioning** helps manage compatibility. This way, clients can upgrade at their own pace while the system handles requests in line with the version they are using.

### 9. **Online Schema Changes**
   - Some database systems provide **online schema changes** tools to allow modifications without locking tables or causing downtime (e.g., `gh-ost` or `pt-online-schema-change` for MySQL). These tools perform schema changes in small chunks to ensure the system remains responsive.

### 10. **Testing and Monitoring**
   - **Extensive Testing**: Automated testing (unit, integration, migration, etc.) helps identify issues early before deploying schema changes to production.
   - **Monitoring and Rollback Plans**: Schema changes often involve significant risk, so monitoring is crucial for detecting problems early. Rollback plans are essential to revert changes if issues arise.

### Example Workflow for Changing Schema
1. **Prepare the Database for Compatibility**:
   - Add new columns or tables that the new application version will use.
   - Update application code to write data to both the old and new columns (dual writes).
   
2. **Deploy the New Application Version**:
   - Update the application to read from the new schema elements. Keep writing to both for backward compatibility.
   - Monitor system behavior for any issues.

3. **Cut Over to the New Schema**:
   - Update code to only use the new schema elements once stability is ensured.
   - Remove dual writes and deprecate any old schema elements.

4. **Clean Up**:
   - Once the new schema is stable, drop the deprecated elements from the database.

This approach ensures resilience to issues, minimizes downtime, and allows for smooth transitions during database schema changes.
