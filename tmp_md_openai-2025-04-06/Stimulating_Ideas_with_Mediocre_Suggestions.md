Is there a name for a question that suggests a mediocre option but which, in doing so, stimulates others to think of better options? E.g., when figuring out where to go for dinner, someone suggests, "Let's go to McDonalds" and then others start suggesting restaurants they prefer more

Yes, the concept you're referring to is known as a "Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis." This hypothesis suggests that the structure of a language shapes its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus the way they think. In your example, suggesting a mediocre option like McDonald's sets a low baseline, prompting others to think more creatively or ambitiously about better alternatives. This can be a subtle form of reverse psychology or a strategy to stimulate more diverse and potentially superior ideas.

That doesn't seem quite right. I was wondering if there is a name for the more specific phenomena where making a mediocre suggestion elicits better suggestions, not the more general phenomenon of language shaping cognition.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The specific phenomenon you're describing doesn't have a widely recognized, specific name in psychological or linguistic terminology. However, it can be related to a few concepts:

1. **Anchoring Effect**: This is a cognitive bias where an individual relies too heavily on an initial piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions. In your example, suggesting McDonald's serves as an anchor that others adjust from to make better suggestions.

2. **Provocative Operation**: In problem-solving techniques, especially in creative problem-solving frameworks like TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), a provocative operation is an intentional, often absurd or suboptimal suggestion made to break conventional thinking patterns and stimulate more creative solutions.

3. **Straw Man Proposal**: This term, often used in negotiations and brainstorming, refers to an intentionally weak or simplified proposal made to stimulate discussion and elicit more thoughtful or robust proposals.

These terms don't exactly match the scenario you've described, but they orbit around the same idea of using an initial, less ideal option to stimulate better thinking or alternatives. The specific strategy of suggesting a deliberately mediocre option to encourage better ideas doesn't have a widely-recognized name but is a common tactic in brainstorming and group decision-making contexts.
