Suggest ways to improve this Q&A answer:
Q: It seems we have recently experienced some attrition in product and engineering. Do we have a sense of the drivers there and what the future of those organizations might look like? There seems to have been an increase in departures within EPD recently. What are we doing to ensure we don’t lose momentum or velocity as we continue to compete head to head with Copilot? Are we thinking about outsourcing any dev work to deliver certain features faster?
A: From Erika Rice Scherpelz
Each individual’s case is different, but we are looking at ways to make it so that teammates do not feel like they need to be always on and that the volume of work is overwhelming. Some specifics that we’re investing in:
The roadmap provides clarity about what work is upcoming and its priority. We want to continue to build on this to build a muscle around the idea that the important thing isn’t to be working on everything right now. The important thing is to be optimizing for delivering value quickly, which often requires doing less at once.
Have more people working on things together and target timezone alignment as much as possible. People want to work with their peers, but when the people they are working most closely with have little-to-no overlap, that can become stressful instead of energizing. 
To increase capacity and sustain momentum, we have an aggressive hiring plan which involves hiring 9 devs and 2 EMs over the coming months. We also plan to hire 2 PMs. 
We are focusing our next few Cody hires in the US so that we can better balance the support load. Because right now only a few people on the Cody Core team are in the US and our customers are more heavily weighted toward the US, the support burden ends up being carried by the same small group of people or ends up imposing unsustainable working hours when support is handled by someone far away from the customer they are supporting. 
With respect to outsourcing dev work, we have been and continue to utilize non-FTE contractors to accelerate work, including 4 contractors working on JetBrains and Eclipse plugins  and 2 starting on Visual Studio this month. We also have 2 contractors working on PLG frontend work and 2 more who handle testing.

### Q: We have recently experienced some attrition in product and engineering. Do we have a sense of the drivers behind this and the future of those organizations? Additionally, how are we ensuring we don’t lose momentum as we compete with Copilot? Are we considering outsourcing any development work to deliver certain features faster?

**A: Erika Rice Scherpelz**

**Understanding Attrition Drivers:**
- **Workload and Pressure:** We've identified that a significant factor contributing to attrition is the overwhelming volume of work and the pressure to be constantly "on." We are actively working to alleviate this by providing clearer roadmaps and prioritizing tasks effectively.

**Key Investments and Initiatives:**
1. **Clear Roadmaps and Prioritization:**
   - We are enhancing our roadmap clarity to ensure that the team understands upcoming work and its priorities.
   - Emphasizing that the goal is to deliver value quickly, which often means focusing on fewer tasks at a time.

2. **Collaboration and Timezone Alignment:**
   - Encouraging more collaborative work by aligning team members' time zones to minimize stress and maximize energizing interactions.
   - Ensuring that team members can work closely with their peers, which is crucial for maintaining morale and productivity.

3. **Aggressive Hiring Plan:**
   - We plan to hire 9 developers and 2 engineering managers over the next few months to increase our capacity.
   - Additionally, we will hire 2 product managers to support the growing needs of the team.

4. **Balancing Support Load:**
   - Focusing our next Cody hires in the US to better balance the support load, considering our customer base is heavily weighted toward the US.
   - This will help distribute the support burden more evenly and avoid unsustainable working hours.

**Outsourcing Development Work:**
- We are leveraging non-FTE contractors to accelerate specific projects:
   - Currently, we have 4 contractors working on JetBrains and Eclipse plugins, with 2 more starting on Visual Studio this month.
   - Additionally, 2 contractors are handling PLG frontend work, and 2 are focused on testing.

These efforts are designed to ensure we maintain momentum and velocity while addressing the root causes of attrition. By optimizing our workflows, improving collaboration, and expanding our team strategically, we are committed to staying competitive with Copilot and delivering high-quality features efficiently.

Each person’s situation is unique, but we’re seeing a trend where the volume of work and the pressure to always be "on" are significant factors. We’re actively looking at ways to make sure our teammates don’t feel overwhelmed. Here’s what we’re doing:

**Roadmap and Prioritization:**
- We’re putting a lot of effort into making our roadmap clearer. This helps everyone see what’s coming up and what’s most important. The key is not to try to do everything at once but to focus on delivering value quickly, even if that means doing fewer things at the same time.

**Collaboration and Timezone Alignment:**
- We’re also encouraging more teamwork and trying to align time zones as much as possible. It’s important for people to work with their peers without the stress of having little-to-no overlap in their work hours.

**Hiring Plans:**
- To boost our capacity and keep up the momentum, we have an aggressive hiring plan. We’re bringing on 9 new developers and 2 engineering managers over the next few months, plus 2 product managers.

**Balancing Support Load:**
- We’re focusing our next few Cody hires in the US to better balance the support load. Right now, the Cody Core team has only a few members in the US, which puts a lot of pressure on them since most of our customers are based here. This move will help spread the support responsibilities more evenly and avoid unsustainable working hours.

**Outsourcing Development Work:**
- We’re already using contractors to speed up certain projects. We have 4 contractors working on JetBrains and Eclipse plugins, with 2 more starting on Visual Studio this month. We also have 2 contractors working on PLG frontend work and another 2 focused on testing.

These steps are aimed at making sure we don’t lose momentum or velocity. By clarifying our priorities, improving collaboration, expanding our team, and leveraging contractors, we’re confident we can stay competitive with Copilot and continue delivering high-quality features efficiently.
