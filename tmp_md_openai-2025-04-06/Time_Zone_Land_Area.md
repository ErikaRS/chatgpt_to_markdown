Sorting time zones by the amount of land they cover is tricky because time zones aren't perfectly aligned with longitude; they follow political boundaries and economic regions. However, here’s a general ranking from least to most land area, considering both small territories and vast continental zones:

### **Time Zones with the Least Land Area:**
1. **UTC+12:45** – **Chatham Islands, New Zealand** (one small group of islands)
2. **UTC+13:45** – **New Zealand's Tokelau and parts of Tonga** (tiny islands)
3. **UTC+08:45** – **Western Australia (Eucla region)** (small sliver of land)
4. **UTC+12** – **Wake Island (US territory), some Pacific islands** (tiny territories)
5. **UTC+05:45** – **Nepal Standard Time** (covers only Nepal)
6. **UTC+03:30** – **Iran Standard Time** (just Iran)

### **Medium-Sized Time Zones (Small-to-Medium Countries and Island Groups):**
7. **UTC-02** – **Parts of Brazil, South Georgia & South Sandwich Islands**
8. **UTC+04:30** – **Afghanistan (one country, but large landmass)**
9. **UTC-03:30** – **Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada** (a single province)
10. **UTC+08** – **China (one country but massive land area)**
11. **UTC-09:30** – **Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia)**

### **Time Zones with the Most Land Area:**
12. **UTC-05** – **Eastern Time Zone (Eastern US, parts of Canada)**
13. **UTC+01** – **Central European Time (CET) (Large part of Europe & North Africa)**
14. **UTC+03** – **East Africa, parts of Russia, Saudi Arabia**
15. **UTC+05** – **Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, parts of Russia**
16. **UTC+07** – **Western Indonesia, parts of Russia, Thailand**
17. **UTC-06** – **Central Time (US, Canada, Mexico, parts of Central America)**
18. **UTC+09** – **Japan, Korea, Eastern Russia**
19. **UTC+10** – **Eastern Australia, parts of Russia**
20. **UTC-07** – **Mountain Time (Western US, Canada, parts of Mexico)**
21. **UTC-04** – **Atlantic Time (Caribbean, parts of South America, Canada)**
22. **UTC+02** – **Most of Africa, Eastern Europe**
23. **UTC+11** – **Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, parts of Russia, Micronesia**
24. **UTC-08** – **Pacific Time (Western US, Canada, parts of Mexico)**
25. **UTC+06** – **Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, parts of Russia**

### **The Time Zone with the Most Land Area:**
26. **UTC+03 to UTC+12 (Russia Standard Time Zones Combined)** – Russia spans 11 time zones, but since China uses only one time zone (UTC+08), **UTC+03, UTC+04, UTC+05, UTC+06, UTC+07, UTC+08, UTC+09, UTC+10, UTC+11, and UTC+12 all cover parts of Russia**, making them the largest single time zone regions by land.
