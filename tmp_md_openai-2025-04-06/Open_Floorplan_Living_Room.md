{"size":"1024x1024","prompt":"Design a floor plan layout of a living room within an open floorplan house where the living room is positioned at the end of a sequence, yet remains open and adjacent to paths and entrances. The living room should have a cozy, enclosed feel despite being part of an open floorplan. It should be bordered by walkways and possibly entry points on at least two sides, with furniture arranged to create a natural boundary or separation from these paths. The living area should include a sectional sofa, a coffee table, and a media console against one wall, with large windows or a sliding glass door on one side leading to an outdoor space. The paths should flow naturally around the living room, leading to other parts of the house."}
