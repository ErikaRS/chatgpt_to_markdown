Reduce this to 300 characters or less, keeping the same overall tone and wording as much as possible: 
Hey Cody! I feel like we were adjacent to knowing each other at Google. I'd love to connect... and I do have a secondary motive beyond the general Google connection. I heard about the Kythe team being impacted by layoffs ðŸ˜ž. I am at Sourcegraph these days, a developer tools company that has a Code Search product and AI coding assistant (also Cody). If you're interested in learning more about Sourcegraph, I'd love to tell you more!
