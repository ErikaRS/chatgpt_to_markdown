Sure, here's an alternate verse for a song in the style of "The Right Stuff" by New Kids on the Block, themed around a high-quality context retrieval and generation AI coding assistant named Cody from Sourcegraph:

---

(Verse 1)
In the world of code, where challenges are tough,
Comes a hero named Cody, with the right kind of stuff.
Searching through the lines, with a digital touch,
Bringing answers to light, never too much.

(Chorus)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the right stuff,
Cody's on the scene, making coding not so rough.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the right stuff,
With Sourcegraph's might, Cody's more than enough.

(Verse 2)
From Python to Java, through frameworks and more,
Cody navigates the syntax, like never before.
Augmented and ready, for every task ahead,
Transforming queries into code, nothing to dread.

(Chorus)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the right stuff,
In a world of zeros and ones, Cody's got the right bluff.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the right stuff,
Making coding a breeze, with intelligence tough.

(Bridge)
Every line of code, a story to tell,
Cody's AI mind, breaking every shell.
From retrieval to generation, a seamless blend,
A coding companion, on whom you can depend.

(Chorus)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the right stuff,
Cody, the AI wonder, never saying "enough".
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the right stuff,
In the digital realm, Cody's the real stuff.
