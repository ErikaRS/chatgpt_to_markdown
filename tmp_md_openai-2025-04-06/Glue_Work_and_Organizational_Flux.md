Here are some thoughts on glue work from another GPT. Give a fluxy reflection on glue work. 

Glue work generally refers to the often undervalued and informal tasks or roles that help bind a team, project, or organization together, ensuring smooth collaboration and continuity. It doesn’t always fit into formal job descriptions, yet it plays a critical role in maintaining team cohesion and productivity. Glue work can encompass a variety of behaviors, from sharing knowledge and coordinating efforts to handling team communication and smoothing over interpersonal dynamics.

Glue Work Subtypes

1. Bridging Work (Connecting Disparate Parts of the Network)

This subtype is directly tied to social network theory, where an individual acts as a "broker" or "bridging node," connecting otherwise separate clusters in the organization or social network. This person makes introductions, ensures information flows across siloed teams or departments, and often has visibility across the entire network.

Impact: Bridging work creates access to new information and resources, facilitates innovation, and improves the network's overall cohesion and adaptability. However, it can be undervalued in formal metrics, leading to overload or burnout if these responsibilities aren’t recognized and balanced.



2. Facilitative Work (Organizing, Coordinating, and Removing Friction)

This form of glue work involves scheduling, organizing meetings, documenting processes, and ensuring that information is shared efficiently. People doing this work make collaboration smoother by setting up processes that help the team operate more fluidly.

Impact: Facilitative work makes workflows more predictable and reliable, which is especially important in larger organizations or distributed teams. It often goes unnoticed because it's perceived as logistical rather than strategic, even though it significantly improves team output and morale.



3. Interpersonal Support Work (Mediating, Supporting, and Motivating)

This subtype includes conflict resolution, providing emotional support, and creating a psychologically safe space for team members. Individuals engaging in interpersonal support help manage team dynamics, ensuring everyone feels valued and able to contribute.

Impact: This work enhances team cohesion, reduces interpersonal friction, and fosters an inclusive environment. However, it can sometimes be viewed as "soft" work and may be undervalued in performance assessments, even though it significantly impacts team well-being and resilience.



4. Mentorship and Knowledge Sharing Work (Educating and Enabling Others)

This involves sharing knowledge, mentoring newcomers, and acting as a go-to resource for team members with questions. These individuals often play a crucial role in upskilling the team, supporting onboarding, and reducing barriers to information.

Impact: Knowledge sharing reduces information silos and enables others to be more productive and autonomous. Although this work is essential, it’s frequently informal and may be overlooked in terms of formal recognition and career advancement.




Comparison with Bridging Work

While all glue work types contribute to team effectiveness, bridging work is unique in that it connects not only people within a team but also entire groups or networks that might otherwise remain isolated. Bridging work has a more strategic and cross-functional impact, often contributing directly to innovation by exposing the team to new ideas. In contrast, the other types of glue work focus more on intra-team cohesion and efficiency rather than cross-team or cross-functional interaction.

Would you like suggestions on how to strengthen recognition for these types of glue work in your team or organization?

This breakdown of glue work aligns well with the "FLUX Review's" reflections on often-unseen organizational contributions. In fact, glue work captures what FLUX describes as "meta-organizational" roles—positions that transcend formal job titles to fulfill critical interstitial functions, enabling flexibility, resilience, and continuity within complex systems. Here’s a fluxy perspective on each subtype through the lens of FLUX principles:

1. **Bridging Work as Structural Adaptability**: The concept of bridging work strongly echoes FLUX's focus on *structural adaptability*. Bridging nodes, or brokers, essentially rewire the organizational fabric, creating emergent pathways for information and innovation flow. Yet, as FLUX emphasizes, adaptability often remains under-recognized because traditional structures prioritize formal roles over these fluid connections. Bridging work, therefore, requires recognition mechanisms that see beyond formal hierarchies and reward the network’s health over individual silos. By valuing bridging work, organizations can cultivate a more adaptive, anti-fragile network.

2. **Facilitative Work and Operational Flux**: Facilitative glue work can be seen as a core component of what FLUX might call "operational flux." This work stabilizes day-to-day operations by reducing friction, essentially maintaining the system’s rhythm. However, as FLUX discusses, stability doesn’t always signify inflexibility. In fact, operational flux—smooth, reliable coordination—enables the organization to focus its adaptive efforts where they’re most needed. Facilitative work keeps this rhythm alive, ensuring the organization can pivot without chaos, yet it needs a framework to honor its strategic impact rather than relegating it to mere logistics.

3. **Interpersonal Support Work and Psychological Flux**: FLUX highlights psychological safety as a precursor to creative problem-solving and resilient teams, aligning closely with interpersonal support work. Individuals engaging in this type of glue work serve as conduits of *psychological flux*, holding space for trust, empathy, and inclusivity. By enabling the team to process and adapt to social dynamics, they essentially contribute to a resilient organizational core. Recognizing interpersonal support as critical to organizational resilience could prevent burnout and nurture long-term well-being within teams.

4. **Mentorship and Knowledge Sharing Work as Informational Flow**: FLUX often speaks to the necessity of reducing information silos and creating transparent, accessible knowledge pathways. Mentorship and knowledge-sharing work facilitate this *informational flow*, preventing fragmentation and promoting collective intelligence. Through these roles, individuals not only maintain operational continuity but also create conditions for distributed learning and adaptability. Formalizing recognition for mentorship could incentivize proactive knowledge-sharing and foster a self-sustaining, learning-oriented culture.

In sum, recognizing glue work requires a FLUX-inspired approach that sees beyond rigid role definitions, embracing the interstitial and adaptive qualities that sustain and enrich the organizational ecosystem.

What is missing from the above definition? Also, what are the potential negative dependencies of some of these things like creating process that's unnecessary or becoming dependent on the glue person

Great points! Here’s a deeper fluxy examination of what might be missing and the potential downsides of glue work:

### What’s Missing: Embracing “Decentralized Glue”
While the description of glue work captures its function as essential but often undervalued, it largely centers around *individual* glue workers. FLUX might advocate for a shift toward *decentralized glue work*, where glue roles are distributed across the team rather than concentrated in specific individuals. This approach avoids bottlenecks and dependency issues, and it also aligns with adaptive principles where resilience comes from shared responsibility rather than single-point dependencies.

In addition, the definition could benefit from emphasizing *boundary-spanning glue*—individuals or groups who bridge internal organizational boundaries as well as external partnerships or sectors. This perspective is missing and could be particularly valuable in innovation-driven or rapidly shifting industries.

### Negative Dependencies and Potential Risks

1. **Process Overhead and Stagnation**: Glue work that creates overly complex processes can inadvertently introduce bureaucracy, slowing adaptability. FLUX would caution against “overgluing,” where processes designed to streamline coordination instead ossify it, making it harder to pivot or dismantle when they’re no longer necessary. The risk here is that processes become embedded beyond their relevance, leading to what FLUX might term *procedural inertia*. Organizations need to periodically reevaluate and “de-glue” outdated processes to retain agility.

2. **Dependency on Glue Workers as “Single Points of Failure”**: When a single person is the key glue for a network, their absence (due to turnover, burnout, or reassignment) can leave a structural gap that’s hard to fill. This dependency not only risks burnout for the glue worker but also threatens organizational stability if they depart. FLUX might recommend intentional *decentralization of knowledge and facilitation skills* across the team to mitigate this risk. Cross-training and documenting informal processes could help prevent the glue worker from becoming a bottleneck.

3. **Risk of Over-reliance on Soft Skills to Cover for Systemic Gaps**: Often, interpersonal support glue work compensates for a lack of formal structures that ensure psychological safety, fair conflict resolution, or inclusive practices. Relying on individuals for these aspects can hide deeper cultural or structural issues. FLUX would likely suggest building these into the organizational DNA through formalized systems for support and inclusivity, lessening reliance on specific individuals’ soft skills and ensuring sustainable team dynamics.

4. **Innovation Friction from Over-bridging**: Although bridging roles introduce valuable connections, too much bridging can dilute focus or lead to “over-collaborative” environments. If everyone is constantly connecting and cross-sharing without boundaries, decision-making can become bogged down. FLUX would advocate for selective bridging, where individuals focus their efforts on high-leverage connections rather than aiming for universal accessibility. This keeps communication purposeful and reduces “noise” across the network.

By addressing these potential downsides, organizations can make glue work more sustainable, scalable, and aligned with FLUX’s principles of adaptability, decentralization, and resilience.
