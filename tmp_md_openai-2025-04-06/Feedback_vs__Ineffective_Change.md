How would you describe someone who is open to feedback on the surface but never seems to change in response to that feedback?

A person who appears open to feedback but never alters their behavior in response to it can be described as "intractable" or "resistant to change". They may display a fa√ßade of receptiveness or a "pseudo-receptive" attitude. This suggests they are open-minded and willing to adapt when, in reality, they remain unswayed by the constructive criticism or guidance offered. 

This lack of change can be due to various reasons, such as a deep-seated belief in their own methods, a fear of change, a lack of understanding of the feedback given, or a tendency to disregard others' opinions. Despite their outward show of listening and understanding, their actions speak differently, reflecting an "in one ear, out the other" mentality.

It's also possible that they could be resistant to feedback due to emotional reasons. This is often associated with the term "defensive", as they might consciously or unconsciously defend their existing ways and beliefs. The resistance could also be a form of passive resistance or passive aggression, where the person indirectly expresses their opposition to the change by pretending to accept the feedback but then not acting on it.

However, it's important to note that change often takes time, and immediate transformation should not always be expected. In some cases, people need time to process and integrate feedback. If the same patterns persist over a long period, though, and the person shows no signs of making the recommended changes, then the terms above may be applicable.

Is there a more general colloquial term for this sort of person?

### Assistant - 2023-06-15 14:46:37

In colloquial terms, someone who consistently fails to change their behavior in response to feedback might be referred to as "stubborn" or "set in their ways." These terms are widely understood to refer to people who resist changing their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors, even in the face of compelling reasons to do so.

An expression like "talking to a brick wall" might also be used to describe the experience of trying to give feedback to such a person, implying that your words have no effect, much like trying to communicate with an inanimate object.

I'm looking for something that more emphasizes the part where they seem receptive to feedback on the surface, perhaps even intentionally trying to build such a reputation, but in practice they aren't.

### Assistant - 2023-06-15 14:48:35

Someone who appears to be open to feedback but doesn't act on it might be referred to as a "lip service" giver. This term describes a person who publicly expresses agreement, approval, or allegiance, but in practice does not take action to support these claims. In other words, they are all talk and no action.

In a similar vein, such a person could also be called a "yes man" or a "yes person." These terms usually refer to someone who agrees with everything said, particularly in a work or business context, often to maintain favor with a superior. This behavior could extend to pretending to accept feedback but not actually incorporating it.

However, do keep in mind that these terms can carry negative connotations and should be used carefully depending on the situation and context.

Ahh, lip service. That's what I was trying to remember.

### Assistant - 2023-06-15 14:48:49

Great! Yes, "lip service" is a widely recognized term for expressing agreement or support in words but not following through in actions. It's often used in situations where someone appears to accept feedback or endorse an idea, but doesn't implement the changes or take the steps necessary to reflect that acceptance or endorsement. Remember, it's always important to be aware of the context and potential implications when using such terms.
