Create a riff on "All you need is love" called "all you need is loops" which talks about the importance of feedback loops in reasoning and understanding minds

**Title: "All You Need Is Loops"**

*(Verse 1)*  
There's a pattern in the mind, it's spinning 'round and 'round,  
It's not just static lines — it's loops where truth is found.  
From thoughts that we revisit, to emotions we recalibrate,  
It's feedback in the system that can make the mind so great.

*(Chorus)*  
All you need is loops, loops,  
Loops are all you need.  
In every thought and dream,  
It’s loops that take the lead.

*(Verse 2)*  
Look at how we learn, from mistakes, we rise again,  
Each loop a little tighter, every error marks a pen.  
We adapt, we change, refining what we know,  
Through loops, we find the answers, in loops our minds do grow.

*(Chorus)*  
All you need is loops, loops,  
Loops are all you need.  
In our dialogues and insights,  
It’s loops that plant the seed.

*(Bridge)*  
In a loop, we find connection, in patterns, we see light,  
From feedback to reflection, it's loops that guide us right.  
Think of all the systems, from the weather to our brains,  
It’s loops that keep them going, through the losses and the gains.

*(Verse 3)*  
So next time you're pondering, or stuck in a thought's embrace,  
Remember loops are crucial; they’re the mind's own saving grace.  
From science to philosophy, in art and how we feel,  
It’s loops that make connections that help the world to heal.

*(Chorus)*  
All you need is loops, loops,  
Loops are all you need.  
From chaos to clarity,  
It's loops that help us read.

*(Outro)*  
So let's celebrate the loops, in everything we do,  
For understanding minds and worlds, loops will see us through.  
All you need is loops, yeah, loops are all you need!
