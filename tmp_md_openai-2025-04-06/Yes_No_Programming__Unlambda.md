what is that programming language where it only answers yes or no

It sounds like you're referring to the "Unlambda" programming language. Unlambda is a minimalistic, "purely functional" esoteric programming language. Its primary feature is the lack of conventional operators, and it instead uses a series of function application combinators.

However, one of the more peculiar and notable features of Unlambda is its "I/O" system. It only provides two methods of output: printing the character "s" or terminating the program with an error. This effectively means that Unlambda programs can only answer "yes" (by printing "s") or "no" (by erroring out). 

There are other esoteric languages out there with unusual or limited features, but Unlambda's unique "yes/no" output makes it stand out in this specific context.

No, not that one. It starts with a 'p', I think

Ah, you might be thinking of "Piet". Piet is an esoteric programming language in which programs are abstracted as abstract artworks. However, Piet is not limited to just "yes" or "no" outputs.

If it's not Piet and it specifically answers only "yes" or "no", then the language you're thinking of might not be one of the more commonly known esoteric languages. There are many esoteric languages out there, and some might be quite obscure.

Is there any other detail or context you can provide to help identify it?

Oh, prolog!

Ah, Prolog! Yes, that makes sense. Prolog (short for "Programming in Logic") is a declarative programming language associated with symbolic reasoning and artificial intelligence. It is based on formal logic and allows for the definition of relations and the querying of these relations.

In Prolog, when you pose a query to the system, it attempts to prove the query based on the rules and facts you've defined. The typical responses from Prolog are:

- `true.`: If the query can be proven true with the given facts and rules.
- `false.`: If the query cannot be proven true.
  
Additionally, Prolog can also provide variable bindings if the query contains variables. For example, given the fact `parent(john, alice).`, if you query `parent(john, X).`, Prolog will respond with `X = alice.`.

But in many simple cases, especially when testing the truth of a specific assertion, Prolog will just respond with `true` or `false`, which is likely why you associated it with "yes" or "no" answers.
