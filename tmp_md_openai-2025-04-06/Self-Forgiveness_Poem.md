Write a poem of comfort and self forgiveness for when you've done wrong but not so much as you've been blamed

In twilight's hush, a gentle song,
Whispers of a heart once strong.
Amidst the shadows, tears may fall,
For mistakes made, both big and small.

Yet in this moment, let us find,
A balm for the weary, troubled mind.
Forgive yourself, as stars forgive night,
For even the moon sometimes lacks light.

Each misstep, a lesson, a hidden grace,
A chance to grow, not a mark of disgrace.
So let go of burdens, heavy and old,
Embrace your worth, more precious than gold.

The past is a teacher, wise and stern,
From each of its lessons, we live and learn.
You're more than the errors you fear and dread,
You're the dreams you've chased, the life you've led.

In the mirror of time, may you see,
A soul resilient, strong, and free.
For every tear shed, a new strength born,
In the heart's quiet, self-forgiveness is sworn.

So breathe in peace, let go of the strife,
You're the artist of your own beautiful life.
In the canvas of days, each stroke a part,
Of the masterpiece that is your heart.
