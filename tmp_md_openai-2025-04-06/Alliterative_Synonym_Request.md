what is a synonym for habit that starts with "t"? My goal is to make this sentence more alliterative "From techniques to habits to technologies, we all rely on tools to make sense of the world around us"

A synonym for "habit" that starts with "t" could be **"tendencies"**. It would make your sentence more alliterative:

*"From techniques to tendencies to technologies, we all rely on tools to make sense of the world around us."*

Would you like me to explore any other options, or does this work for you?
