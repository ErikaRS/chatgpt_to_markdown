Suggest improvements to this end-of-the-year wrap-up piece
It’s our last newsletter of the year, a good time to reflect on what we wrote about this year. 

We talked a lot about organizations and their complexity.
In When to Pick a Process (or not), we applied the Cynefin framework to get a better sense of when processes help us and when they feel like overhead.
Tried to separate “good easy” from “bad easy” in Simple problems vs. easy solutions.
Explored Ashby’s law of requisite variety in The hidden complexity within ‘us’
Mentioned meta-rationality and the paradox of balance in Mess up anything with this one weird trick and The disappearing problem (with a bonus Schelling Traps lens)
Discerned the difference between Attention and awareness for organizations 
Highlighted the importance of recognizing Hidden keystones in the organization.
Talked about sick and lost organizations in Lost and found and the nuance in the ability of good leaders to make people safe even through harshest transitions in Bridging from illusion to reality. We also explored power dynamics in Asymmetric threats.
Discussed an organization’s inability to reflect on its own challenges in Getting the elephant out of the room and in Paddling down the river of success.
Touched on the idea that To build long-term you have to remember long-term.
Argued In Defense of Reorgs.
Noticed how ZIRP rules everything around me and connected ZIRP with psychological safety in Rising interest rates, rising standards.
Talked about The risks of peculiar specialization and brushed up on the “top five” productivity hack in Spreadsheet all the things? How about five of ‘em?

We continued our dive into our Selves in Life at the speed of meaning making, Facets of identity, Growing into guilt, Know thy hooks, Undignified gifts, and Herding cats of the mind.

Very closely related to that, we explored the sense of agency by using a skiing metaphor to describe a technique to obtain agency in Shifting forward and a way to orient ourselves toward agency in Of tide pools and fish tanks and See the horse.

We spent a bunch of time with our systems thinking hat on:
We brought up complex systems and emergence in Three Mazes, Stumbling towards manageable uncertainty, and You can’t slay quicksand.
Pointed at an interesting property of systems that survive and thrive: Success creates calluses
Talked about gardening and taste in On Cultivation, and some more about taste in Dancing with art.
Wondered What vaudeville teaches us about disruptive innovation, accompanied by the Moat Digging and Moat Filling lens.
Implored to Sweat the details to enrich our mental models, and once more in The treasure is in the details.
Came up with the Information sloshing technique 

As we usually do, we invented a bunch of 2x2s: 
An experiment by any other name,
Thinking and doing, for the navy and the pirates,
Intentional farming,
The varying roles of AI in our lives,
To spread or not to spread, and
The trap of mismatched perceptions.

We highlighted a well-known (Mayer et al.) model of trust and how Trust is a long game.

We mined a whole library of lenses:

Wrote up and polished the classic lenses like over-adaptation, the bullwhip effect, hysteresis, the adjacent possible, composable alphabets, peanut buttering, whale fall (part two!), the sloping floor, regression to the mean, reality distortion fields, kayfabe and cargo cults, responsibility laundering, and of course, legibility.
Repurposed ideas to create somewhat novel lenses like load-bearing beliefs. the snake oil test, the highway pothole effect, the product development flashlight, crumple zones, Texas sharpshooters, confabulation, steelmanning, and Zeno’s project.
Mentioned Chesteron’s fence and riffed on the puzzles and mysteries lens.
Learned about stop energy, extrusion, and the sour spots lenses and artfully collided lenses in "To Be or To Do” in “The Inner Ring” and the revealed specialist.
Suggested that iron sharpens iron might be a more effective replacement for the “us vs. them” lens.
Explored the lens of NPCs and Live Players
We even asked ChatGPT to help us craft some new lenses.

We recommended a bunch of books: Team Topologies, Finding Meaning in an Imperfect World, Collaborative Intelligence, Who Rules the Earth, The Whole-Brain Child, The Checklist Manifesto, The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows and Deliberate Calm. 

ChatGPT also gave us some book recommendations, riffing on ours.

Finally, we talked about Why we FLUX and peeked into our hopper.

Whoo! This year is a wrap for us FLUX folks. See you next year!

This end-of-year wrap-up piece for the FLUX newsletter is comprehensive, reflecting on the diverse topics covered throughout the year. Here are some suggestions to enhance it:

1. **Categorization for Clarity**: The piece, while thorough, might benefit from a clearer categorization of topics. For example, group discussions under headings such as "Organizational Dynamics," "Personal Development," "Systems Thinking," and "Creative Lenses." This structure could help readers recall the topics more vividly.

2. **Interactive Elements**: Consider adding interactive elements like hyperlinks to past newsletters. This would be especially useful for readers who may want to revisit certain topics, such as the Cynefin framework discussion or the exploration of Ashby’s law.

3. **Visual Summaries**: Incorporate visual elements like infographics or diagrams, especially for the 2x2s invented. Visuals can act as quick, memorable summaries of complex ideas.

4. **Highlight Key Insights or Trends**: Dedicate a section to distill key insights or trends observed throughout the year. For instance, how discussions about organizational complexity might reflect broader trends in the business world, drawing on your discussion in "Tried to separate 'good easy' from 'bad easy'."

5. **Reader Engagement**: Invite readers to share their favorite pieces or insights from the year. This can be a valuable feedback mechanism and enhance community engagement.

6. **Reflective Questions**: Pose reflective questions related to the themes discussed. For instance, after mentioning the “Importance of recognizing Hidden keystones in the organization,” you could ask, “What hidden keystones have you discovered in your organization this year?”

7. **Preview of Next Year**: Give a sneak peek into what themes or questions you aim to explore in the coming year. This builds anticipation and keeps readers engaged.

8. **Acknowledgements Section**: Include a section acknowledging contributors, guest writers, or notable community members. This adds a personal touch and strengthens the sense of community among your readers.

9. **Incorporate Feedback or Success Stories**: If available, incorporate reader feedback or success stories about how the insights from FLUX have been applied in their personal or professional lives.

10. **Closing Reflection**: End with a reflective note or a thought-provoking question that encapsulates the ethos of FLUX and sets the tone for the coming year.

Remember, the essence of FLUX is about exploring and connecting complex ideas. Ensuring the wrap-up piece embodies this spirit will resonate deeply with your readership.
