The term "Product-Led Sales" (PLS) is often used to distinguish from traditional enterprise licensing models, particularly in the context of Product-Led Growth (PLG). Here are the key distinctions that set PLS apart from typical enterprise licensing:

1. **PLG is the overarching ideology, while PLS is a component of it**: PLG is about creating a business strategy that focuses on delivering more meaningful experiences for customers, whereas PLS is an enabler of this approach, leveraging the product itself as a key sales driver【8†source】.

2. **PLG is a mindset; PLS is a process**: PLG is considered a broader mindset emphasizing product-centric growth, while PLS is the actual sales process that operates under this mindset, often involving a freemium model policy and a strong focus on product experience【8†source】.

3. **PLG is qualitative; PLS is quantitative**: PLS tends to be more process-oriented and data-driven, focusing on measurable customer behaviors and sales outcomes. In contrast, PLG has a broader qualitative impact, affecting the overall business approach to product success and customer engagement【8†source】.

4. **PLG is inbound; PLS is outbound**: PLG is internal, motivating employees and influencing company culture, while PLS looks outward, engaging customers and external sales activities【8†source】.

Using "Product-Led Sales" as an alternative term acknowledges the distinct approach to how products are sold, particularly in the SaaS and software markets, where the product experience plays a crucial role in customer acquisition and expansion.

Sorry, I wasn't clear. Right now we have PLG licensing and enterprise licensing. Is there a term other than "licensing" we can use so that one of them is licensing and the other is... something else?

In the context of distinguishing between Product-Led Growth (PLG) and traditional enterprise licensing models, instead of using "licensing" for both, you could consider the following alternatives for PLG:

- **"Subscription"**: Emphasizes ongoing use and access to the software, typically associated with SaaS models.
- **"Access Plan"**: Highlights the flexible nature of PLG, where users often start with a free version and can upgrade for more features.
- **"Membership"**: Implies a sense of community and ongoing engagement with the product.
- **"Usage Model"**: Can denote a pay-as-you-go approach, which is sometimes used in PLG strategies.

For enterprise licensing, maintaining the term "licensing" is appropriate since it's well-understood in the industry to involve more traditional, often larger-scale, negotiated agreements.
