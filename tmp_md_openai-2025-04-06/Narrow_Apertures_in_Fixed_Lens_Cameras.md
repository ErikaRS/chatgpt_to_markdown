why do fixed lens digital cameras have narrower effective aperture values

The maximum aperture of a camera lens, often referred to as its "speed," is primarily determined by its physical construction. It's not inherently the case that fixed lens cameras (i.e., cameras with a non-interchangeable lens) have narrower apertures than interchangeable lens cameras. However, there are a few factors that might make this seem to be the case:

1. **Size and Design Constraints:** Fixed lens cameras, particularly compact and point-and-shoot models, are often designed to be small and portable. Because of this, the lenses must also be relatively small. A larger aperture requires a larger lens diameter, which might not be feasible in a compact design. 

2. **Cost:** Larger apertures require more complex and precisely manufactured glass elements, which increases the cost of the lens. Because fixed lens cameras are often positioned as more budget-friendly or entry-level options, manufacturers may opt for a narrower aperture to keep costs down.

3. **Versatility:** Many fixed lens cameras come with zoom lenses that cover a wide range of focal lengths. These are typically variable aperture lenses, meaning the maximum aperture changes as you zoom in or out. To maintain reasonable size, weight, and cost, these lenses typically don't have very wide maximum apertures, especially at longer focal lengths.

4. **Diffraction Limit:** Diffraction is an optical effect that can decrease sharpness at very small aperture values (large f-numbers). Compact camera sensors are often smaller than those in DSLR or mirrorless cameras, and smaller sensors reach the diffraction limit at larger apertures. Thus, compact camera lenses might not offer very small apertures to avoid image quality issues.

However, it's worth noting that there are fixed lens cameras with large maximum apertures. For example, many high-end compact cameras have lenses with maximum apertures of f/1.8 or even f/1.4. These cameras offer the image quality benefits of a large aperture, such as improved low light performance and shallow depth of field, in a fixed lens design.
