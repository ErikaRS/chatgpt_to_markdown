Help me understand Locality sensitive hashing 

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:34:26

Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH).

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a method of performing probabilistic dimension reduction of high-dimensional data. The basic idea is to hash the input items so that similar items are mapped to the same "buckets" with high probability (the number of buckets is typically much smaller than the universe of possible input items).

This technique is used for approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms in high-dimensional spaces, as well as for other applications like detecting near-duplicate documents or images. LSH has gained attention because it effectively addresses the "curse of dimensionality," where computational resources required by traditional methods exponentially increase with increasing dimensionality.

Here's a simple way to understand how LSH works:

1. **Hash Function**: Choose a hash function where the probability of collision is higher for objects that are closer to each other. This is a key aspect, as conventional hashing methods strive to avoid collisions. Here we intentionally want similar items to collide (end up in the same bin or bucket).

2. **Bucketing**: All items in the data set are hashed. Similar items (based on the hash function from step 1) fall into the same bucket. The key idea is that only items in the same bucket are compared for similarity.

3. **Candidate Pairs**: From the bucketing process, we can easily find pairs of items that are likely to be similar (since they hashed to the same bucket). These pairs are called "candidate pairs".

4. **Verification**: Each candidate pair is then checked for actual similarity (this can be done using a more computationally intensive similarity measure).

LSH allows us to drastically reduce the number of comparisons needed when searching for similar items. Instead of comparing each item to every other item in the dataset, we can just compare items that end up in the same bucket.

While LSH is not perfect and can miss some similar items (which is why it's called an "approximate" nearest neighbor search technique), it offers a good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in many applications. The performance of LSH can be tuned by adjusting parameters like the number of hash tables used (multiple hash tables increase the likelihood of similar items colliding) and the number of hash functions per table.

What are some example hashing algorithms that are good for LSH?

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:35:41

There are a number of hashing algorithms that are suitable for Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). The best choice of hash function depends on the type of data and the similarity measure you are interested in. Here are a few examples:

1. **Euclidean LSH**: This family of hash functions is appropriate for points in Euclidean space (i.e., real-valued vectors), where the similarity measure is the Euclidean distance (L2 norm). One common Euclidean LSH technique is to use random hyperplanes to divide the space and assign each data point a hash value based on which side of the hyperplane they fall on.

2. **Cosine LSH**: If the cosine similarity measure is used (which computes the cosine of the angle between two vectors), random hyperplane hashing can also be used. Each vector is hashed to 1 if it lies on one side of a randomly chosen hyperplane and 0 if it lies on the other side.

3. **MinHash**: If the data consists of sets and the similarity measure is the Jaccard coefficient (which measures the ratio of the size of the intersection of the sets to the size of the union of the sets), then the MinHash algorithm can be used. MinHash assigns a hash value to each set such that the probability that two sets have the same hash value is equal to their Jaccard similarity.

4. **SimHash**: SimHash is a method that is used when you want to identify items that are 'close' under the Hamming distance, which measures the number of bit positions where two bit strings differ. This is commonly used in text or document similarity.

Remember, these are probabilistic methods, meaning there is a small chance of collision even for dissimilar items (false positives), and similar items might not always collide (false negatives). By adjusting parameters and using multiple hash tables, one can control the trade-off between precision, recall, and computational efficiency.

Explain minhash in more depth. How is it computed?

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:36:53

MinHash is a locality-sensitive hashing technique for determining the similarity between sets. It's typically used in large-scale document or item comparison tasks, where direct comparison would be computationally too intensive. Here is how it works:

**MinHash Algorithm:**

1. **Permutation/Hashing**: Let's say you have a data collection of items, each represented as a set of elements (e.g., a document represented as a set of words). The first step in MinHash is to convert these sets into a binary incidence matrix, where rows correspond to elements and columns correspond to sets (items). Each cell in the matrix is set to 1 if the set contains the element corresponding to the cell's row, and 0 otherwise.

   Then, you create a number of different hashed permutations of the rows in this matrix. These hashed permutations can be thought of as new row orderings of the matrix. In practice, instead of actually permuting rows, a hash function with a different random seed can be used to simulate the effect of a permutation.

2. **Signature Generation**: For each column (representing an item or a set), you then record the index of the first row in the permutation that has a 1 (that is, an element that exists in the set). This row index is the "MinHash" for that column under the specific permutation. It's called a MinHash because you're essentially finding the element with the minimum hash value in the set.

3. **Similarity**: This process is repeated for each permutation, building up a MinHash "signature" for each column. The number of permutations used is a parameter that you can choose. More permutations will give a more accurate estimate of similarity but will require more storage and computation.

   The similarity between two columns (sets) is then estimated as the fraction of hash functions (permutations) for which the MinHashes of the two columns are equal. This turns out to be a good estimate of the Jaccard similarity, which is the size of the intersection of the sets divided by the size of their union.

Note that in practice, instead of starting from a binary incidence matrix, you usually start directly from the sets themselves, and use a hash function to hash the elements to integers, simulating the effect of permuting the rows.

The key advantage of MinHash is that it allows you to compare the MinHash signatures instead of the original sets, which can be much more efficient for large and numerous sets. Furthermore, the MinHash signatures can be used with other data structures and techniques (like hash tables or a technique called "banding") to quickly find sets that are likely to be similar, without having to compare every pair of sets.

Walk through an example please

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:39:28

Sure, let's consider a simple example.

Suppose we have three documents (A, B, and C), with the following words:

- Document A: {cat, dog, mouse}
- Document B: {dog, rabbit, mouse}
- Document C: {cat, horse, rabbit}

First, we represent these documents in a binary matrix format, where each row represents a word, and each column represents a document. A "1" indicates the presence of a word in the document, while a "0" indicates absence.

|          |  A  |  B  |  C  |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|
|   cat    |  1  |  0  |  1  |
|   dog    |  1  |  1  |  0  |
|  mouse   |  1  |  1  |  0  |
| rabbit   |  0  |  1  |  1  |
| horse    |  0  |  0  |  1  |

Next, let's pick three hash functions (i.e., three permutations). In practice, these would be real hash functions, but to keep the example simple, we'll just use three permutations of the row order:

1. Permutation 1 (P1): cat, dog, mouse, rabbit, horse
2. Permutation 2 (P2): dog, rabbit, cat, mouse, horse
3. Permutation 3 (P3): horse, rabbit, mouse, dog, cat

For each permutation, we record the first word (i.e., the minimum hash value) that appears in each document:

| Permutation/Hash Function |  A  |  B  |  C  |
|---------------------------|-----|-----|-----|
|            P1            | cat | dog | cat |
|            P2            | dog | dog | rabbit |
|            P3            | dog | mouse | horse |

Finally, we can estimate the similarity between each pair of documents as the fraction of hash functions where they have the same minimum value:

- A and B: 1/3 (because for P2, both have 'dog' as the first element in the permutation)
- A and C: 1/3 (because for P1, both have 'cat' as the first element in the permutation)
- B and C: 0/3

This gives us a rough estimate of the Jaccard similarity of each pair of documents, which is the size of the intersection of the documents divided by the size of their union. For example, the Jaccard similarity of A and B is 2/4 = 0.5 (because they share 2 words, and their total unique word count is 4), which is quite close to our MinHash estimate of 1/3.

Remember, in practice, we would use a larger number of hash functions to get a more accurate estimate, and the hash functions would be real hash functions, not just permutations. Also, this is a simplified example. With real documents and a large vocabulary, the matrices would be very large and sparse, but the MinHash technique would still work the same way.


### User - 2023-07-05 06:40:22

Show the example again with hashing 

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:41:24

Sure, let's adjust the example to use hash functions rather than permutations. In practice, these hash functions would be selected to provide a good spread of values across the input range, but for simplicity's sake we'll use three simple hash functions:

1. h1(x) = length(x) modulo 5  (Here length(x) represents the length of the string x)
2. h2(x) = (length(x) + 2) modulo 5
3. h3(x) = (2*length(x) + 3) modulo 5

Let's apply these hash functions to our words. Our words are 'cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'rabbit', and 'horse'.

|   Word   | h1(x) | h2(x) | h3(x) |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
|   cat    |   3   |   0   |   1   |
|   dog    |   3   |   0   |   1   |
|  mouse   |   0   |   2   |   3   |
| rabbit   |   1   |   3   |   4   |
| horse    |   0   |   2   |   3   |

Now, for each document (set), we find the minimum hash value under each hash function. Remember, our documents are:

- Document A: {cat, dog, mouse}
- Document B: {dog, rabbit, mouse}
- Document C: {cat, horse, rabbit}

| Document/Hash Function | h1(x) | h2(x) | h3(x) |
|------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
|          A            |   0   |   0   |   1   |
|          B            |   0   |   0   |   1   |
|          C            |   0   |   0   |   1   |

As we can see, all documents have the same minimum value for all hash functions. This might seem surprising, but remember that this is a simplified example with a small set of words and simple hash functions. With real-world data and hash functions, you would see more variety in the minhash signatures.

Despite this, we can still calculate the estimated similarity between the documents based on their minhash signatures. The estimated similarity would be the fraction of hash functions where the two documents have the same minimum hash value:

- A and B: 3/3 = 1
- A and C: 3/3 = 1
- B and C: 3/3 = 1

These results indicate a perfect similarity between all documents based on the MinHash values, which is not true according to their actual contents. This highlights that the choice of hash functions is crucial for MinHash and you would typically need more complex hash functions and a larger number of them for accurately estimating the similarity in practice.

What is banding as applied up LSH?

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:43:01

Banding is a technique used in the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) process to further tune the balance between precision and recall when identifying candidate pairs that are approximately similar.

The basic idea is to divide the MinHash signatures of each item into bands, consisting of a certain number of rows (hash functions), and hash each band into a number of buckets. Items that hash to the same bucket for any band are considered as candidate pairs.

For example, let's say we have a MinHash signature of length 100 for each item. We could divide these 100 values into 20 bands, each containing 5 values.

Now, let's walk through how banding works:

1. Divide each item's MinHash signature into bands. In our example, this means breaking the 100-value signature into 20 groups of 5 values each.

2. For each band, hash its portion of each item's signature to one of a number of buckets. Items that have the same hash value for a band (that is, end up in the same bucket) are considered a candidate pair.

3. Repeat this process for each band. If two items end up in the same bucket for any band, they are considered a candidate pair.

The number of bands and the number of rows per band are parameters that you can adjust. More bands and fewer rows per band will make the technique more sensitive, meaning it will find more candidate pairs, at the risk of more false positives. Conversely, fewer bands and more rows per band will result in fewer false positives, but might miss some actual similar pairs (false negatives).

Banding thus offers a way to control the "precision-recall tradeoff" in the LSH process. It's part of what makes LSH such a powerful and flexible technique for similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.

Does LSH work well for numerical embeddings or only for text data due to the need for input to be represented as sets? 

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:44:19

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a versatile method and it's not limited to text data or data represented as sets. It can also work well with numerical embeddings or any high-dimensional data. The main consideration is choosing the right LSH family, or hash function, that aligns with the way you want to measure similarity or distance in your data.

For example:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: If your data are real-valued vectors and you're interested in the cosine similarity between vectors (common for text data represented as TF-IDF vectors or Word2Vec embeddings, but also applicable for other kinds of data), you could use the random hyperplane LSH family.

2. **Euclidean Distance**: If you're interested in the Euclidean distance between points (common for many kinds of numerical data), there are LSH families based on "p-stable distributions" or "cross-polytope LSH" that you could use.

3. **Hamming Distance**: If your data are binary vectors and you're interested in the Hamming distance between vectors (the number of positions at which the corresponding values are different), you could use the bit sampling LSH family.

So, in summary, LSH can be used with numerical embeddings as well as text data. The important thing is to choose or design an LSH family that reflects the notion of similarity or distance that is appropriate for your specific application.

Under distance based hashes, how is LSH different from an inverted file index which clusters based on spatial properties?

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:48:17

An inverted file index and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are two different strategies used for handling high-dimensional data, often in the context of searching for similar items or nearest neighbors. They have different strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on the specific characteristics and requirements of the problem at hand.

**Inverted File Index**: The inverted file index, often used in information retrieval, works by creating a mapping from individual features (like words in a text document) to the list of documents that contain that feature. When you want to find documents similar to a given document, you can look up the documents for each feature in the document and combine the results. The advantage of this approach is that it can be very fast, especially when the number of features is relatively small, and the distribution of features is highly skewed (i.e., most documents contain only a small fraction of all possible features). However, it does not handle well the similarity in terms of overall pattern, and it is not designed to capture the nuances of high-dimensional numeric data.

**Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: LSH, on the other hand, works by hashing data points in such a way that similar items are likely to hash to the same bucket. This allows us to quickly find candidate pairs of similar items by only comparing items in the same bucket. LSH is designed to handle high-dimensional data, where traditional methods (like computing the distance between every pair of points) would be computationally prohibitive. LSH can work with different measures of similarity (like Jaccard similarity for sets, cosine similarity for real-valued vectors, etc.) by using different families of hash functions.

In summary, LSH tends to be more versatile and better-suited to high-dimensional numerical data than an inverted file index. An inverted index is simple and effective for problems with a large number of sparse features (like text document retrieval). However, for problems involving dense, high-dimensional numerical data (like image or audio data), LSH is often a better choice.

What if the inverted file index uses vornoi cells to produce the mapping. Doesn't the cell coordinate effectively act as a hash? What is the difference between that and, e.g. LSH using euclidian distance?

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:50:45

In the context of high-dimensional data, both an inverted file index with Voronoi cells and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using Euclidean distance can be used to accelerate nearest neighbor search. Both methods try to partition the space to reduce the number of potential comparisons.

**Voronoi Cells with Inverted File Index**: When you use Voronoi cells in an inverted file index, you're effectively partitioning the data space into regions, each of which is associated with a specific data point (the "center" of the Voronoi cell). When you get a new point, you determine which Voronoi cell it falls into (that is, which data point it's closest to), and you only compare it with other points in the same cell. This can greatly reduce the number of comparisons needed. The challenge here lies in the construction and the lookup in the Voronoi diagram, which can be computationally intensive in high dimensions.

**LSH using Euclidean Distance**: On the other hand, LSH using Euclidean distance works by applying a set of hash functions to each data point, such that points that are close in the Euclidean space are likely to hash to the same bucket. When you get a new point, you compute its hash values and compare it with other points that have the same hash values. This can be a more efficient way to reduce the number of comparisons, especially for very high-dimensional data.

So, you're correct in noting that both methods effectively act to hash the data points, reducing the number of comparisons needed. However, the specific approach to hashing is different, as are the computational trade-offs. 

In general, LSH tends to be more efficient for very high-dimensional data, because its computational complexity does not depend strongly on the dimensionality of the data. Voronoi-based methods, on the other hand, can become computationally prohibitive as the dimensionality increases, due to the 'curse of dimensionality'. But for lower-dimensional data, Voronoi-based methods can be very effective, and they have the advantage that they always return the exact nearest neighbor (whereas LSH only returns an approximate nearest neighbor).

Remember that these are general guidelines, and the best method to use can depend on the specific characteristics of your data and the requirements of your application.

Give an example of how a euclidian distance hash suitable for LSH might work 

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 06:52:07

Sure, a commonly used approach for creating a Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) family for Euclidean distance is based on the concept of "random projections" or "random hyperplanes". Here is a simplified version of how such a hash function might work:

Let's say your data points are 2-dimensional, i.e., each data point is a vector with two elements: `[x, y]`.

1. A random line (in 2D) or hyperplane (in higher dimensions) is drawn through the origin. In our 2D example, let's say this line has a slope of `m`.

2. Each point in the plane is projected onto this line. The projection of a point `[x, y]` onto the line with slope `m` can be calculated as `p = (x + m*y) / sqrt(1 + m^2)`. This is simply the dot product of the point with the unit vector along the line.

3. The line is divided into segments of a certain length `r`. You can think of these segments as "buckets".

4. The hash value of a point is the identifier of the segment its projection falls into.

Points that are close together in Euclidean space will have close or identical projections and will therefore tend to have the same hash value, i.e., fall into the same bucket. Points that are further apart will have a lower probability of hashing to the same value.

This process can be repeated with multiple random lines (hash functions) to create an LSH family, and these can be used in the typical LSH way to identify candidate pairs for further comparison.

Remember that this is a simplified version of how such a hash function might work. In practice, the lines would be chosen in a higher-dimensional space, and the computations would be a bit more complex. But the basic idea of using random projections to divide the space into regions (buckets), and using these to create an LSH family, is a core idea in many LSH schemes for Euclidean distance.

Does Random hyperplanes with dot-product and Hamming distance approximate cosine similar, euclidian distance, or something else?

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 07:04:31

Random hyperplane hashing or random projection hashing is a type of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method that is particularly well-suited for cosine similarity. 

Here's why:

The random hyperplanes method works by creating multiple random hyperplanes in the high-dimensional vector space, and then for each hyperplane, computing whether the vector is above or below the hyperplane. If the vector is above the hyperplane, it's assigned a value of 1, and if it's below, it's assigned a value of 0. This is done by taking the dot product of the vector and the hyperplane's normal vector; if the dot product is positive, the vector is above the hyperplane, and if it's negative, the vector is below the hyperplane.

Cosine similarity between two vectors measures the cosine of the angle between them. If two vectors have a small angle between them (i.e., they are close to each other), their cosine similarity is close to 1. If the vectors are orthogonal (i.e., not similar), the cosine similarity is 0. And if the vectors point in opposite directions (i.e., they are dissimilar), the cosine similarity is -1.

The key point is that the angle between two vectors, which determines their cosine similarity, also affects the probability that they will fall on the same side of a randomly chosen hyperplane. That's why the random hyperplanes method is a good way to approximate cosine similarity. 

So, to answer your question, random hyperplanes with dot-product and Hamming distance are designed to approximate cosine similarity rather than Euclidean distance. The Hamming distance between the binary codes generated by the random hyperplanes serves as an approximation of the angle between the vectors. The smaller the Hamming distance, the smaller the angle and the higher the cosine similarity.

### User - 2023-07-05 07:07:45

Is there a hamming space equivalent of the euclidian distance spatial hashing? E.g. one that uses random hyperplanes that are not centered at the origin to compute the binary dimensions? Or do euclidian distance versions always use protection and bucketing, like in the example above?  If so, how is the binary value computed? 

### Assistant - 2023-07-05 07:08:19

When we're working with high-dimensional binary vectors (i.e., in a Hamming space), the usual LSH method is quite straightforward. Each hash function is typically chosen to be a simple "bit sampling" operation, where one of the dimensions (or bits) is selected at random, and the hash function returns the value of the vector in that dimension. 

Now, when we try to construct a LSH scheme that respects Euclidean distance in a binary Hamming space, things get a bit more complicated. One possible approach could be to use random hyperplanes as in the cosine similarity case, but to compute the distance in the projected space using Euclidean distance rather than cosine similarity. However, this would require dealing with real-valued vectors rather than binary vectors, which might not be ideal in all situations.

Another approach might be to use an LSH family specifically designed for Euclidean distance, such as those based on "p-stable distributions". In a binary Hamming space, this might involve taking a random linear combination of the bits (with coefficients drawn from a p-stable distribution), rounding the result to the nearest integer, and using that as the hash value.

To directly answer your question: There isn't a straightforward "Hamming space equivalent" of the random projections approach for Euclidean distance that uses binary values. The specific method you would choose to construct an LSH family would depend on the specific characteristics of your data and the requirements of your application.

As a final note, remember that while LSH provides a powerful tool for dealing with high-dimensional data, it is not the only tool available. Depending on the specific characteristics of your data and the requirements of your application, other methods (such as tree-based methods, quantization-based methods, or deep learning-based methods) might also be appropriate.
