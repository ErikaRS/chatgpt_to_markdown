I am working on a message for an engineering team that has seen a lot of change, including a reorg and layoffs. The goal is to give an update on what has changed with project as well as communicate the sense that "we know what we want to achieve in the next 5 months, and we need every single one of you".

The tone should be forward looking, confident, and upbeat. 

Titles I am considering are "Next steps for engineering", "Moving forward in engineering"

Please suggest 17 other titles

Rate these titles based on how much they might cause a sense of worry for folks who recently saw teammates laid off. 

### Assistant - 2023-09-07 14:23:19

Certainly. I'll rate the titles based on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means least likely to cause worry and 5 means most likely. The reasoning will be based on the perception that any ambiguity or lack of clarity might trigger concerns in the context of recent layoffs.

1. "Engineering Update: The Plan for the Next 5 Months" - **2** (Clear and to-the-point, but the word "plan" may evoke some slight concern)
2. "What's Next for Our Engineering Team" - **4** (The "What's Next" part might be perceived as uncertain)
3. "A Quick Look at Engineering's Upcoming Priorities" - **3** (Focus on priorities might make some wonder about their role)
4. "Engineering Roadmap: The Next Steps We're Taking" - **2** (Clear direction, though "next steps" might slightly evoke concerns)
5. "Team Update: Where We're Headed in Engineering" - **3** (The "Where We're Headed" part can be perceived as uncertain)
6. "Engineering's Focus for the Coming Months" - **2** (Straightforward, but the focus on the future might cause slight worry)
7. "Upcoming Projects and Priorities in Engineering" - **3** (While it's clear, the word "priorities" might be a trigger)
8. "Engineering Team: Our Goals for the Next 5 Months" - **2** (Clear about goals, but might still evoke minor concerns)
9. "What to Expect in Engineering: The Near Future" - **4** (The "What to Expect" can seem vague and uncertain)
10. "Our Engineering Direction: A Brief Overview" - **3** (Mentions direction, but "brief" can seem like there's more unsaid)
11. "Engineering Goals: What We're Aiming for Next" - **2** (Clear about goals, but "aiming" might sound like things aren't finalized)
12. "Team, Here's Our Engineering Plan Moving Forward" - **2** (Clear plan, but "moving forward" might trigger minor concerns)
13. "Engineering's Path: Our Next Milestones" - **2** (Mentions a clear path, but "next milestones" might evoke slight worry)
14. "A Glimpse into Our Engineering Agenda" - **3** (The word "glimpse" can be perceived as if there's more hidden information)
15. "Our Engineering Vision for the Upcoming Months" - **2** (Vision-oriented, with a slight focus on the future)
16. "Let's Talk About Engineering's Future Steps" - **4** (The phrase "Let's Talk" might be seen as initiating a discussion about changes)
17. "Engineering's Upcoming Focus Areas: A Quick Update" - **3** (Clear, but "focus areas" can make some ponder their place)

In summary, for a sensitive environment post-layoffs, clarity, transparency, and avoidance of ambiguity are key. The lower-rated titles are likely safer choices in this context.

### User - 2023-09-07 14:23:52

Can you suggest 5 titles that keep the "email subject" vibe and would rate a 1 on this scale?

Below is a draft message. The audience is the engineering team at a small tech company. The goal is to provide clarity and reinforce that we have a plan and everyone on the team has a role to play. Content between colons, like :letsgoooooooo: will be translated to Slack emojis and can be ignored. Critique this message and give feedback about where it could be more clear, more concise, or where the message can be tweaked to better meet the goals.

Draft message:
Next Milestones
Hello team! I’ve heard folks have questions about the practical implications of the team changes. If you have questions, do we have a spreadsheet :google_sheets: for you! @kalan and the rest of the Job Fair Planning group went through every job fair project and mapped it to the product roadmap. This should capture the changes relative to ongoing, but as always, let us know if you see :telescope: gaps.

@stevey and I also want to provide some more clarity on how the teams we have fit into the strategy. We started to preview that at Merge (recording | slides), and those of you who were there started thinking through team missions. To recap:
Search Suite: Double-down on our Search product suite to make it more accessible for more devs.
Cody: Build Cody into the world’s best AI coding assistant that targets customers of all sizes.
Platform: Uplevel Sourcegraph’s ability to deliver value quickly and reliably.
Infrastructure: Build reliable, efficient infrastructure that is easy to deploy and manage.
Security: Enable the business by providing proactive security and address vulnerabilities in a timely manner.


The Product Strategy + Roadmap connects these focus areas to our broader mission as well as to some of the strategic approaches we’re taking to get there. What makes this strategy empowering is that it is based around goals, and not individual projects. Even as we get new ideas, our goals of making our Search product suite more accessible and making Cody the world’s best AI coding assistant will stay evergreen. Our organizational structure was designed to help deliver this strategy and offers the same combination of direction and stability. Each team and each one of you is critical to achieving this.

We’ll continue to send updates about how our processes are changing, including the introduction of Product-Focused Planning for the next release. 

Please continue to let us know where you see gaps or misalignment. And let’s go! :letsgoooooooo:

Your draft message is well-structured and conveys a sense of clarity and direction. However, there are some areas where the message can be refined to be more concise and clear. Here's a breakdown of the message with feedback:

1. **Introduction**: 
   - The introduction is playful with the "do we have a spreadsheet for you!" comment, which can be a positive way to engage the audience. However, you might want to be cautious depending on how the team is feeling post-layoffs/reorg. 
   - Consider being more direct about the purpose of the spreadsheet to clarify its importance.

2. **Regarding @kalan and Job Fair Planning group**:
   - The term "Job Fair Planning group" is a bit unclear. Consider providing more context or simplifying the term.
   - The phrase "capture the changes relative to ongoing" is a bit ambiguous. What does "ongoing" refer to?

3. **Discussion on team missions**: 
   - The use of the term "Merge" might be unclear to some (unless it's a universally understood term within the company). Consider providing a brief context.
   - Consider bullet points for clarity when listing the team missions.

4. **Product Strategy + Roadmap**:
   - The statement about the strategy being empowering because it's based around goals and not projects is a great touch, reinforcing the stability and direction of the organization.

5. **Organizational structure**:
   - The phrase "offers the same combination of direction and stability" is slightly vague. Consider specifying what "combination" you're referring to.
   - The statement "Each team and each one of you is critical to achieving this" is strong and reinforces the message that everyone is essential. Well done!

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The introduction of "Product-Focused Planning for the next release" is mentioned without much context. Consider briefly explaining what it entails or why it's significant.
   - The closing is motivational, but again, gauge the mood of the team to ensure this doesn't come off as dismissive of any concerns.

**Revised Message**:

**Next Milestones**

Hello team! We understand there've been questions about the recent team changes. To address these, we've compiled a comprehensive spreadsheet :google_sheets: that outlines the alignment of our Job Fair projects with the product roadmap. This document should provide clarity on any changes. Please review it and let us know if you notice :telescope: any gaps.

@stevey and I also want to shed light on the roles of our current teams in the broader company strategy. We introduced this during our recent meeting at "Merge" ([recording | slides](#)). To reiterate:

- **Search Suite**: Enhance our Search product suite for broader developer accessibility.
- **Cody**: Develop Cody into the premier AI coding assistant for all customer sizes.
