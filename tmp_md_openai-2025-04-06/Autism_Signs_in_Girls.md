Signs of autism in girls and women can sometimes be different from those in boys and men, and they might be less obvious. Here are some signs that may indicate autism in girls and women:

1. **Social Challenges:**
   - Difficulty in understanding social cues or unwritten social rules.
   - May have one or a few close friendships, but struggle with larger social groups.
   - Prefer to interact with those older or younger, rather than peers of the same age.

2. **Communication Differences:**
   - May have good verbal language skills but struggle with non-verbal communication.
   - Difficulty in understanding sarcasm, jokes, or figurative language.
   - Tendency to take things literally.

3. **Interests and Behavior:**
   - Intense interest in certain topics or hobbies, which can be more age-appropriate and less noticeable than those of boys.
   - May engage in repetitive behaviors or have specific routines and get upset when routines are disrupted.
   - Sensory sensitivities, such as discomfort with certain fabrics, sounds, or lights.

4. **Emotional Sensitivity:**
   - High sensitivity to emotional stimuli and may become easily overwhelmed by feelings.
   - Difficulty in regulating emotions, leading to meltdowns or shutdowns.

5. **Camouflaging:**
   - Girls and women are often better at masking or camouflaging their symptoms, mimicking social behavior and hiding their difficulties.
   - This can lead to internalizing struggles and may result in anxiety or depression.

6. **Challenges at School or Work:**
   - Struggles with organizational and time management skills.
   - May excel in certain academic areas but have significant difficulties in others.

It's important to note that autism is a spectrum and presents differently in each individual. If autism is suspected, a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional experienced in diagnosing autism is essential. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and offer guidance and resources for support.
