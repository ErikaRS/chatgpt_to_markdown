What's the opposite of graceful degradation where things fail in a harsh way?

The opposite of graceful degradation, where systems fail in a harsh or abrupt manner, is often referred to as "catastrophic failure". In the context of engineering and computing, a catastrophic failure is a sudden and total failure from which the system cannot recover. This may involve a crash, loss of data, or some other abrupt and severe problem. It's the opposite of graceful degradation, which is a design concept where the functionality of a system, machine, or network gradually decreases, even when a part of it fails or breaks down.

Graceful degradation is a design concept in systems engineering, electronics, computer science, and other fields. The idea is to ensure that even when certain parts of a system fail or are non-operational, the overall system continues to function, albeit at a reduced level.

For instance, in a computer network, if one server fails, the network should still function, but perhaps with reduced capacity or slower speeds. In the context of web development, a website is said to degrade gracefully if it continues to provide functionality even when viewed with older browsers that don't support some of the latest web technologies.

The goal is to avoid catastrophic failure and to allow the system to continue to operate and provide value to users even in the face of malfunctions or adverse conditions. It's essentially a way to make systems more robust and fault-tolerant. 

The opposite concept is "progressive enhancement", where basic functionality is available to all, and more advanced functionality becomes available as the capabilities of the system or the user's environment improve.
