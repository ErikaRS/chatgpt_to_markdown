I will be pasting in my personal notes, chapter by chapter. Turn each set of notes into a chapter outline, keeping the original wording as much as possible but reordering things so that related points are together. The raw notes were written by voice transcription, so where something doesn't make sense relative to the content of the book, retain it but mark it with **(problematic text)** Please fix minor grammatical errors.

Of course, I'd be happy to help with that. Please paste in your notes for the first chapter, and I'll get started on creating an organized outline for you.

Chapter title: The Six Causes of Burnout

Contents:
-  Motivation-Hygiene Theory
- The Hierarchy of Needs at Work

Notes:
Chapter one: this is a heavy hitting chapter which goes over the six causes of burnout. It starts by emphasizing that burnout doesn't have overnight. It is a slow erosion of coping skills and one's ability to adapt to chronic stress. Because of this, people can't just say no to burn out . Self-care is an important tactic, but it's too far downstream to be preventative. There are six factors that contribute to burnout, although a person doesn't need to experience all of them to be experiencing burnout. To understand burnout, it helps to understand motivation-hygiene theory. Organizational hygiene are the things that an organization must do to keep things on track. If a company is not fulfilling its hygiene obligations, then people will be on a path to burn out. However, hygiene alone is not enough. This is a dual factor theory where the habits that are needed to maintain hygiene are separate from the habits that promote motivation. Hygiene factors. Ensure an employee is not dissatisfied. Motivation factors encourage employees to hire performance. Both are equally important. If you have the motivation factors without the hygiene factors, people satisfied. If you have the hygiene factors without the motivation factors, people will not give their best. These can be seen as parallel to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Hygiene factors are parallel to what are called. Needs, the needs that when not will cause anxiety and stress. Motivational needs are parallel to the need for self-actualization. Burnout is generally an outcome of bad hygiene, not low motivation.
