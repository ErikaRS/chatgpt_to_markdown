Make this more crisp and clear:
I wish Rok the best going forward.

I also want to note that we did not set Rok up for success. We put him on AI and pointed him towards embeddings but then didn't clearly connect that work to anything the Cody team actually wanted. I think these same concerns will continue to cause friction for the AI team as a whole, so it's worth thinking about them.

Given this and given some of the things I've seen brought up about us generally making less progress on AI than hoped, I want to make sure that we have clear actionable things that we want our AI team to do and that those things are attached to concrete product goals. 

Both of these things require the AI team to step up, and they also require clear guidance from product on where the AI team can add value and clear support from eng where they need it. E.g., if the AI team is going to invest in embeddings, we really need to get our story straight on if and when we are going to delivered a Sourcegraph managed embeddings service, something I know has been an active blocker for Rok for months.

I wish Rok the best in his future endeavors. However, it's important to acknowledge that we didn't fully support his success. Specifically, we assigned him to AI, focusing on embeddings, without effectively linking his work to the Cody team's needs. This misalignment may continue to create challenges for the entire AI team, so it deserves our attention.

Additionally, there's a general sentiment that our progress in AI hasn't met expectations. To address this, we need to establish clear, actionable objectives for our AI team, aligning them with specific product goals. 

Achieving this will require two things: First, the AI team needs to be proactive and engaged. Second, they need unambiguous direction and support from the product and engineering teams. For instance, if the AI team is to concentrate on embeddings, we must decisively determine the feasibility and timeline of launching a Sourcegraph managed embeddings service. This issue has been a significant hindrance for Rok and needs to be resolved urgently.
