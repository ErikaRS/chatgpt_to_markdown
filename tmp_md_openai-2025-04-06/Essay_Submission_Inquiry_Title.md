ESSAY 1: 
Culture is a fundamental facet of identity. We all have culture(s) we identify with. But what counts as cultural appropriation is nuanced. Most of the time — but not all — adopting food is not appropriation. Most of the time — but not all — adopting ritual is. Whether or not adopting practices around clothing, hair, body decoration, home and environmental decorations are appropriation is impossible to predict in the abstract.

One nuance is that appropriation depends on who you are and your relationship to the locally dominant culture. In particular, adopting common practices of the dominant culture is often not considered appropriation — in fact, it may be considered a measure of that culture’s dominance. For example, most Christians in the United States don’t object to secular choirs singing Christmas hymns. Translate this same example to a non-dominant culture’s religious holidays, and the situation becomes much more ambiguous.

What makes the difference? A problematic explanation might be that because a locally dominant culture is aligned with the dominant power structures, that culture is less deserving of respect. In this perspective, the culture of, e.g., white Christian Americans in inherently less valuable than that of other cultures. This perspective is problematic and wrong.

In my perspective, a better model is to think of cultural practices as being subject to a social immune system. A dominant culture has the ability to defend itself. If a cultural marker is used inappropriately, there are plenty of members of around to object, and they generally will have ways to be heard. The social immune system is well tuned toward violations of the norms of a dominant culture. This leads to a situation where people can generally assume that what they see is what they get with regards to adopting the cultural practices of a locally dominant culture.

On the other hand, when markers of a non-dominant culture are used, there may not be people with the right background to say whether or not it is appropriate. Or they may object but not have the power or safety to make themselves heard. Thus, when we see a practice being adopted from a locally non-dominant culture, we can’t just assume that it’s okay. It might be problematic. It might be fine. When faced with this uncertainty, we should tread with caution. The social immune system isn’t tuned for these situations.

This isn’t an argument for static, isolated cultures. Cultures evolve over time, and practices can join or leave the locally dominant culture over time. Fashion and food, in particular, are areas of frequent cultural blending. Just as a physical immune system can learn to recognize new things as acceptable or unacceptable, the social immune system can move from “don’t know” to providing reliable feedback that a practice is or not okay to adopt.

One way this evolution happens is through invitation. Cultures are not monoliths and no single person (or group) can authoritatively speak for a culture. Still, as a rule of thumb, if a member of a culture invites you to participate in their practices or gives permission to your usage of a practice, then it’s probably not appropriation. So don’t avoid learning about and participating in practices that may not be a part of your culture. Don’t give into the fear that you might mess up. Instead, keep listening, keep asking, and let the invitations of others help you navigate the way.

(A lot more could be said about this. Invitation is a nuanced topic. For example, an invitation to participate in a particular event can be taken as permission to participate at that time but not necessarily as permission to duplicate the practice on your own. However, a more general invitation, such as selling a cookbook, is a pretty good indicator that you can duplicate the practice on your own.)

ESSAY 2: Generative conflict — collaborative debate as one of my mentors calls it — is critical to effective groups. It helps move a group from Tuckman’s forming stage to the storming stage. Although storming sounds bad, it is a critical period in the development of an effective team. Storming is when team members start to gain each others’ trust, align, and learn how to work together.

Why is generative conflict important for this transition? To build trust, you need to be able to share your perspectives. But if conflict doesn’t feel safe, then you will only share the perspectives that are unlikely to generate debate. That means that the team will not have access to the full range of each other’s perspectives. In addition, healthy conflict helps to build trust because it shows that even when we disagree, we can maintain our relationships with each other.

Making space for generative conflict is harder when teams are not colocated, whether this is because of hybrid work or just because teams are distributed between multiple offices. There isn’t anything inherently magical about being in person. However, there is something magical about open ended conversations. When a conversation has a convergent goal, then a choice has to be made. This automatically means that the options that are not chosen will be implicitly labeled as wrong — or at least less right. This raises the stakes. When a conversation is divergent, the stakes are lowered. Even if disagreeing feels a bit stressful, it is okay if we don’t come to a conclusion, which means that it’s less personally risky to bring up alternatives.

However, divergent conversations often feel like they’re a distraction from “real” work. We need to intentionally make time to have open ended conversations where people can bring up options and respond to each other without the risk of having their opinion implicitly declared wrong when something else is chosen.

Your essay explores the importance of generative conflict, or collaborative debate, within groups and its role in transitioning from the forming stage to the storming stage, as described in Tuckman's model of group development. It highlights several key points regarding the significance of conflict in fostering trust, alignment, and effective teamwork, particularly in distributed or hybrid work environments.

You argue that generative conflict is essential for building trust because it encourages team members to share a broader range of perspectives, even those that may lead to disagreement. This openness helps teams access a more comprehensive understanding of each other's viewpoints and strengthens trust by demonstrating that relationships can withstand disagreements.

Furthermore, you mention that distributed teams may face challenges in creating space for generative conflict compared to colocated teams. However, you emphasize that the magic lies not in physical proximity but in open-ended conversations. Divergent discussions, where there isn't necessarily a need to reach a conclusion, allow team members to explore various options without the fear of being labeled as wrong. This fosters a lower-risk environment for sharing alternative viewpoints and creative ideas.

Your essay effectively highlights the importance of generative conflict and the need for intentionally creating opportunities for open-ended conversations within teams. If you have any specific questions or would like to discuss any particular aspect of your essay further, please feel free to ask.

ESSAY 3: I recently finished reading Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned. The basic thesis is that setting objectives is futile for significant innovation. Objectives can be useful for incremental improvements, but for innovation, we do not know that the path that progress requires. Measuring incremental improvements against the final goal is likely to result in the pursuit of dead ends that seem like they should be moving closer but which are actually missing a vital stepping stone. The vital stepping stones usually require going in a non-obvious direction. You can read more in my goodreads review .

As a colleague noted in a book club discussion of this book, the argument presented in the book is somewhat lacking. It focuses overly much on the particular path that was used to get to some interesting end. E.g., “Computers are great! They needed vacuum tubes. Who would have thought that when first trying to invent computers?” They observe that this assumes that reaching a particular objective is fully path dependent: there is only one particular way to get there from here. In practice, there are likely to be multiple ways to get to a particular end. Vacuum tubes may have been how we first got to scalable computation, but they likely were not the only path to silicon. Bicycles may have been one path to commercial flight, but that doesn’t mean they’re the only one.

A better argument for the futility of objectives to reach ambitious objectives is one that pulls from The Tyranny of the Ideal (my review). In that book Gerald Gaus develops the idea that targeting an ideal is a futile effort. That book describes the ideals in the context of the landscape of justice. I will generalize to talk about objectives more generally.

A fitness landscape provides a way of thinking about how well different agents are doing relative to a particular fitness function. The fitness is the “height” of point in the landscape while the other dimensions of the space represent how similar two points in that landscape are to each other (where closer implies more similarity). In biological evolution, the fitness function is reproductive success and the units being assessed for similarity are genotypes. Fitness landscapes are usually visualized in two or three dimensions. Reality is, of course, often has many more dimensions.


A rugged fitness landscape (source)
The thing that makes a fitness landscape interesting is that two points that are close to each other may not have similar fitness. For example, a small mutation can cause an organism to die, reducing its fitness to zero.

Gaus differentiates between fitness landscapes that are smooth, rugged, and random. These are a spectrum more than distinct types, but I will describe them as types for simplicity.

In a smooth fitness landscape, following the gradient of increasing fitness will always lead you to a global maxima of fitness. In the diagram above, if the fitness landscape consisted only of peak B, it would be smooth.

In a rugged fitness landscape, following the gradient of the fitness function will generally lead to greater fitness. However, a particular position may be a local maxima—there is no more “up” to follow locally—yet globally there are better places to be. The diagram above depicts a rugged fitness landscape. For the red ball, both A and B represent increased fitness, but they do not achieve the same maximum.

In a random fitness landscape, there is no predictability. A step one direction may dramatically increase fitness while the next step may plunge it to nothing. There is nothing to rely upon. It’s hard to survive in a random landscape. Gaus notes that the justice landscape is rugged, like the landscape of many other complex systems.

(Note that a fitness landscape need not be static static. They can be dynamic or, to use the more poetic term, dancing (coined, I believe, by Scott Page). A dancing landscape is one that changes over time. It can change in response to external forces or it can change in response to internal forces, such as when plants evolve to be more attractive to pollinators.)

What does this have to do with objectives? Objectives specify a destination we are trying to get too. In the thinking of Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned, objectives are often used to derive an objective function where the direction we explore is determined by measuring the distance between where we currently are and the objective. Distance from the objective becomes our fitness function.

The thesis of Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned is that using objectives this way is doomed to failure because charting a course straight for an objective means that you miss out on critical stepping stones that may seem, at first, to take you further from the objective. The world of innovation is a rugged landscape. Following what looks like the obvious direction may land you at a dead end, a local maxima from which no more progress can be made.

So that addresses one of the objections to objectives made in Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: objective functions are bad for innovation because innovation occurs in a rugged fitness landscape.

But that does not explain why Stanley and Lehman, the authors of Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned reject objectives as firmly as they do. You can have an objective without using it as an objective function. While I think they take the rejection of objectives a bit far, we can delve further into Gaus’ work to see why there is a seed of truth in their rejection of objectives.

Gradient ascent—simply following the path up—is not the only way to move through the search space. We can look further afield. If we can see the whole landscape, we can figure out which direction to go even if simply maximizing the objective function will lead us down the wrong path. But can we do this? Stanley and Lehman use a metaphor of using stepping stones to navigate across a foggy lake. Gaus states this idea more precisely. He defines a neighborhood as the region in a fitness landscape that we can make reasonably well founded predictions about. Regions in our neighborhood represent small deltas from our current world. Like in the stepping stones metaphor, as we move through this rugged landscape, we learn more and revise our vision of where we can go.

We can only chart a reliable path to an objective when it’s within our neighborhood of knowledge. Because of this fogginess, if the global maxima is not in our neighborhood, then we have no idea where it is. It might be along the current direction of ascent or it might be in a completely different direction. Of course, the neighborhood is really a continuum, not a binary. Thus, there’s not really a strict cutoff of areas where objectives are or are not useful. Rather, the lesson to take away is that the further an objective is from your current knowledge base, the less able you are to navigate there. This is true even when the objective itself can be precisely stated.

Inverting this, we can understand the situations where objectives are useful. When everything we need to know to reach the objective is within our neighborhood of knowledge, then an objective can useful. The objective function still isn’t useful; we may still need to go down before we go up the right hill. Rather, because the objective is nearby, we can chart reliable turn-by-turn directions to our destination. And if the objective is just outside our neighborhood of knowledge, we can do work to expand our neighborhood of knowledge (e.g., building MVPs) to increase the feasibility of being able to meet our objectives.

So, to sum up, in Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned Stanley and Lehman argue that objectives are misleading because the path from here to there may require some unforeseeable side quests. Looking at this through the lens Gaus develops in The Tyranny of the Ideal we can make this more precise: because innovation is a rugged landscape, using distance from an objective as a objective function gives little guidance about which way to go. Furthermore, the limitation of our knowledge to local neighborhoods—the fog between stepping stones—means that we cannot reliably chart out a course even if we are willing to deviate from a more seemingly direct path.

Thank you for sharing your essay, which discusses the concept of objectives in the context of innovation and draws on ideas from "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned" and "The Tyranny of the Ideal." Your essay provides a comprehensive exploration of how objectives can sometimes be misleading or insufficient in navigating the complex landscape of innovation.

You argue that objectives may not be suitable for innovation because they often assume a direct path to a predefined goal. However, in the rugged landscape of innovation, this can lead to missed opportunities and dead ends. Your essay also highlights the importance of recognizing the limitations of our knowledge and the concept of "neighborhoods" in the fitness landscape, which can affect our ability to chart a reliable course toward an objective.

Overall, your essay offers a thoughtful analysis of the challenges associated with using objectives in the context of innovation and provides a valuable perspective on the subject. If you have any specific questions or would like to delve deeper into any aspect of your essay, please feel free to ask.
