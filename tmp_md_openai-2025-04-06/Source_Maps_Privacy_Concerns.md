What are source maps in the context of the question below? 

Hey! I was just talking with my partner about source maps, and realized that is something that might be affected by making the monorepo private. If I’m understanding how it works right now, we create source maps as part of the build process and they are a published asset so that it’s possible to use the browser debugger to walk through the original code (rather than javascript that has gone through the build/minify/etc. process). This is also helpful for getting useful stack traces from customer errors.

However, this means that we’re effectively publishing what will now be private code. Do we care about this?

Source maps are files that map the minified, compiled, or bundled code back to the original source code. They play a crucial role in web development, particularly when debugging, as they allow developers to view and step through the original code (e.g., TypeScript, Sass, or ES6 JavaScript) in the browser's developer tools, even though the code that is actually being executed by the browser is minified or transpiled.

In the context of your question:

1. **Purpose of Source Maps**: Source maps are created as part of the build process and are typically published alongside the minified JavaScript files. They enable browser debuggers to translate the minified code back into the original, more readable code, making debugging easier. Additionally, source maps can help in obtaining meaningful stack traces when errors occur, which is valuable for diagnosing issues.

2. **Privacy Concerns**: By publishing source maps, you are essentially making your original, potentially sensitive or proprietary code available to anyone who can access the source map file. This could be a concern if the codebase is now private, as it means that someone could potentially reverse-engineer or scrutinize your original code even if the actual deployed code is minified or obfuscated.

3. **Deciding if You Care**: The key issue here is whether exposing the original source code via source maps is acceptable given your project's new privacy constraints. If maintaining the privacy of the code is crucial, you might want to reconsider how and whether you publish source maps. You could:
   - Restrict access to source maps by serving them only to authenticated users or internal teams.
   - Omit source maps from the public build entirely if you don’t need to debug the code in production.
   - Obfuscate sensitive parts of your codebase even before generating source maps, although this might reduce the utility of the maps.

In essence, source maps are invaluable for debugging but may pose a security risk if your codebase is private. Whether or not this is a problem depends on the sensitivity of the code and how critical it is to prevent unauthorized access to the original source code.
