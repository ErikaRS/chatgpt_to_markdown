The term "war room" is often used to describe a central command center where teams gather to monitor and manage critical events like product launches. However, due to its militaristic connotations, many seek less aggressive alternatives. Here are some you might consider:

1. **Command Center** - Retains the notion of a centralized monitoring space without the military undertone.
2. **Situation Room** - Emphasizes the focus on situational awareness and decision-making.
3. **Control Room** - Suggests a place where the controls are managed, applicable for technical and operational oversight.
4. **Operations Center** - Focuses on the operational aspects of the launch, suitable for a broader range of activities.
5. **Coordination Hub** - Highlights the collaborative aspect of managing a launch.
6. **Strategy Room** - Puts an emphasis on strategic planning and execution.
7. **Incident Room** - Used particularly for managing responses to unexpected situations during launches.
8. **Launch Pad** - A lighter, thematic option that relates directly to the idea of launching a new product or initiative.
9. **Monitoring Center** - Focuses on the continuous monitoring aspect of the launch process.
10. **Mission Control** - Borrowed from aerospace terminology, suitable for high-stakes or tech-oriented projects.

These alternatives provide various connotations that might better suit the environment and objectives of different organizations.
