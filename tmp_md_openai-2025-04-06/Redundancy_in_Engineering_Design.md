In engineering an element of a design can be load bearing, a critical single point of failure. What is it called when the load is evenly distributed such that any single part can fail and the overall structure stay sound?

The concept you're referring to is generally known as redundancy or distributed loading in engineering terms.

Redundancy is a design concept that involves duplicating critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing the reliability of the system, usually in the case of a backup or fail-safe. In other words, if one part of the system fails, there are other parts that can take over its function without causing the entire system to collapse. 

Distributed loading, on the other hand, is a concept where the weight or force (load) acting on a structure is spread out over its length or surface area rather than concentrated at a single point. This can enhance the stability and robustness of the structure, but doesn't necessarily mean that any single part can fail without affecting the whole structure.

The key point in your question is the ability of a system to withstand the failure of any single part and still maintain its function. This is primarily achieved through redundancy, which allows other parts to take over when one fails. This is common in various areas of engineering such as in the design of aircraft systems, computer networks, bridges, and other structures where safety and reliability are critical.

What if we think of this as a spectrum? 

Load-bearing for me means that a thing or concept is essential to the viability of a system (where a system can be many things at different levels of abstraction). They reduce load on the rest of the system. Their presence makes things better.
In the middle there are things that aren't essential. There presence or absence doesn't change anything.
On the other end there are things that add load to the rest of the system. Their presence actually makes things worse.

What are words for the middle and opposite points of this spectrum?

The terms you're asking for can vary depending on the specific context, but in general terms relevant to a broad spectrum of systems, you might consider these:

1. For the point where an element is essential to the viability of a system, absorbing load from the rest of the system and making things better overall, the term you've already suggested is appropriate: "Load-Bearing" or "Critical".

2. For the midpoint where an element is neither beneficial nor detrimental to the system's operation, you could use terms such as "Neutral", "Non-Critical", or "Redundant". In some contexts, you might also use the term "Inert".

3. For the point where an element is actually detrimental to the system's operation, adding unnecessary load and making things worse, you might use terms such as "Counterproductive", "Detrimental", or "Obstructive". In certain contexts, the term "Parasitic" (like "parasitic load" or "parasitic loss" in engineering) could also be appropriate.

It's worth noting that these are fairly general terms and their applicability may depend on the specific context in which they're being used. For instance, in some contexts "Redundant" might imply a beneficial backup rather than a neutral impact. Similarly, "Inert" might imply complete lack of interaction rather than simply a lack of impact. Always be sure to choose your terms based on the specific characteristics of the system and elements you're dealing with.
