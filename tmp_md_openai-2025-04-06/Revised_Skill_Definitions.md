I am providing definitions for different skills we use to evaluate software engineers. Below is the current definitions, which are too long and don't match the current way we think about expectations. Help generate new definitions for the categories of "impact", "scope" (replaces "proficiency", "execution", and "teamwork"

Current defintions:
Proficiency: This is your demonstrated expertise on the skills relevant to your role and level. Proficiency changes in two ways as you progress in your career. You will increase your technical skills in both depth and breadth â€” often more heavily leaning on one or the other, but still growing both over time. Technical skills include, but are not limited to, quality of code and code reviews; knowledge of relevant technologies, code bases and tools; technical design skills. You will also add and grow other skills that make you a more effective contributor such as providing directional feedback within a relevant scope, giving feedback to others, and over time, setting scope by mapping between business goals, user needs, and technical solutions.
Execution: This is knowing how and acting on what it takes to be productive and achieve the right outcomes for Sourcegraph. Effective execution is generally accompanied by achieving impactful outcomes, but the key element is the skills and consistency you demonstrate to achieve the outcomes, not the specifics of an individual outcome. As you grow in your career, your focus will move from personal productivity and impact within your team to helping broader groups productively reach broader goals.
Teamwork: This is how you collaborate with others to make both them and yourself more effective. Teamwork includes how we interact with both teammates at Sourcegraph and external stakeholders such as our clients. At all levels we expect a professional and collaborative approach to teamwork. As you grow in your career, the span of people you regularly interact with will increase from your working group to multiple groups to stakeholders across and outside of the company. Your influence on our culture will grow from practitioner to champion to shaper.

New Definitions:

**Impact**: The tangible and positive difference made through one's contributions. It's not just about completing tasks but achieving results that drive the company's mission forward. As one progresses in their career, the expectation is to shift from delivering personal results to facilitating and driving larger organizational outcomes.

**Scope**: The breadth and depth of one's technical and non-technical expertise. It encompasses the quality and range of code, knowledge of technologies, and the ability to map business goals to technical solutions. As one's career evolves, the expectation is to broaden one's understanding, influencing not just immediate tasks but larger projects and strategic directions.

**Execution**: The ability to consistently and efficiently translate plans into outcomes. It's about how effectively one can move from idea to result, emphasizing both the process and the end goal. As one advances, the focus shifts from personal productivity to enhancing the efficiency of broader teams and strategies.

**Teamwork**: The art of collaborating effectively with others, both within and outside the organization. It's about fostering a professional and supportive environment, enabling collective success. As one's role grows, the sphere of collaboration expands from immediate teams to multiple departments and even external stakeholders, with an increasing influence on shaping the company culture.
