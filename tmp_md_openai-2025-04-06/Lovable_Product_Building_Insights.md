I am leading a panel discussion on "building lovable products". The panelists will be the head of product and the head of engineering. 

Intended outcomes are:
- Align on a shared and inspirational vision for “building a lovable products” at Sourcegraph
- Showcase the meaningful impact Engineering, Product, and GTM functions play 
- Build trust in leadership by tackling tough questions and answering them transparently

The current set of suggested questions are: 
What does “build a lovable product” mean to you?
Broadly and in the context of Sourcegraph
What are some examples of other companies who’ve built lovable products?
What made them successful?
There are so many different ways we could measure lovability, what do you think should be at the top of that list?
What are we already doing well as a company that will help us make our products lovable?
What do you see as our biggest gaps currently?
What’s the role of engineering/product/sales/marketing on this journey?
How can we be more effective in collaborating with one another, especially when there are differing opinions or priorities?
What steps should we take to balance user needs and feedback with technical feasibility and business goals when making product decisions?
Software should make you feel something. What is it that Sourcegraph is trying to make its users feel?

Critique the list of existing questions, focusing especially on where there are gaps

You have a comprehensive list of questions that cover a wide range of areas pertaining to building lovable products. They do an excellent job of prompting both the head of product and the head of engineering to think deeply and provide insightful answers. 

However, based on your intended outcomes, here's a critique and some suggestions for potential additions or modifications:

1. **Vision Alignment**: 
    - Your first question, "What does 'build a lovable product' mean to you?", is critical for this. However, you might want to expand a bit by asking: "How does your personal vision align with Sourcegraph's vision for building a lovable product?"

2. **Tangible Impact of Functions**:
    - You've included questions about the roles of engineering, product, sales, and marketing. Consider adding a question to highlight specific achievements or milestones: "Can you share a specific instance where the collaboration between Engineering, Product, and GTM led to a significant product improvement or milestone?"
    
3. **Trust in Leadership**:
    - Your questions are geared toward understanding leadership's perspective, but to build trust, it's crucial to know how they handle challenges. Consider: "Can you share a challenging situation where the alignment on building a lovable product was tested, and how did you navigate it?"

4. **User-Centricity**:
    - Your current questions touch on user needs and feedback, but you might want to dig deeper: "How do we ensure that the voice of the user is consistently integrated into our product development process?"

5. **Innovation**:
    - Building a lovable product often involves innovation. Consider adding: "How do we foster a culture of innovation at Sourcegraph to ensure our products remain lovable as market needs evolve?"

6. **Measurement & Feedback Loop**:
    - You've asked about how to measure lovability, but consider expanding on feedback mechanisms: "How do we currently capture feedback on our product's lovability, and how can we improve this process?"

7. **Challenges & Learnings**:
    - It's essential to understand not just the gaps but also the lessons learned: "What are some lessons we've learned in our journey so far towards building a lovable product, and how have they influenced our strategy?"

8. **Future Vision**:
    - While many questions focus on the present state and past experiences, it might be beneficial to look ahead: "Where do you see Sourcegraph's product in the next 5 years in terms of lovability, and what steps are we taking to get there?"

Overall, the existing questions are insightful and will likely lead to a meaningful discussion. By addressing the gaps and adding a few more questions, you'll have an even more robust foundation for your panel discussion.
