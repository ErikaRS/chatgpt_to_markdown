Copy edit this to be more consistent with my overall style, but don't change it too much

I'll start by noting that my rating here is a bit unfair. I've read enough other books on the social brain—both in the context of families and in the context of society—that much of this book felt like a review. It was a well written, well structured review, but if you are familiar with this space and want to understand what additional nuance friendship brings to the picture, you'll find that the ratio of new information to old is on the lower side. 

That said, the book was interesting. Denworth grounds her exploration squarely in the evolutionary biology angle on human behavior. Her goal is to show that friendship isn't just some optional thing that arises from society but rather that it's fundamental to how we survive and relate in the world. One angle she takes on this is showing how friendship-like behaviors, such as taking comfort from the presence of particular non-kin, occur in a wide variety of animals, even fish. In primates, those friendship-like behaviors expand to what can only be called friendship: long term, positive, mutually beneficial but not merely transactional relationship with non-kin. 

So if friendship isn't just a social nicety, it must bring some evolutionary value. Unlike for kin, the value cannot be that it helps to propagate one's genes—although there is something to be said for the idea that since we evolved in kin groups, that could have some implications for the evolution of friendship. What we see is that friendship has literal survival value. People who are chronically lonely suffer worse health outcomes than those who are socially integrated. Friendship has these benefits through providing direct support, connection and empathy, and information. Friends also create social pressure to go along with group behaviors, and while this can be negative at times it overall seems net positive.

The role of friendship varies throughout our lifetime. For children, it's largely about play. For teens, it becomes a key way of learning how to be outside of the family; while friendship is always important, there is no period of life where it is as obviously important as for teens. For adults, family and professional relationships tend to take over while friendship can fall more to the wayside. But as older adults, friendship's importance climbs again. For older adults, in particular, building and maintaining friendships is critical and is correlated with health outcomes.

The later part of the book goes into how technological and societal changes are impacting friendship. There's more nuance than this, but the way I would sum up her argument is: technology amplifies what is already there. When technology is used to strengthen connections, it can be incredibly effective as a way to do so. When it's used as a way to avoid connections, then it can increase isolation. But, for better or for worse, it doesn't really create those dynamics. 

Overall, Denworth's book is full of examples that make these arguments in a compelling and readable way. Although it can be a bit repetitive at time, overall, this is a good introduction to the social brain with a focus on friendship.

My rating here might be slightly unfair. Having read extensively on the social brain—both in the context of families and broader society—much of this book felt like familiar territory. While *Friendship* is well-written and thoughtfully structured, those already familiar with this field may find that it offers less new information and more of a well-organized review. If you're looking specifically for fresh nuances about how friendship adds to the picture, the book provides some, but the ratio of new to known insights may feel modest.

That said, the book is undeniably interesting. Lydia Denworth anchors her exploration in evolutionary biology, aiming to demonstrate that friendship is not a mere societal byproduct but a fundamental element of human survival and social connection. One of the book's strengths is its use of cross-species examples to highlight friendship-like behaviors. These include animals taking comfort from specific non-kin and, in primates, developing relationships that clearly resemble friendship: long-term, positive, mutually beneficial, and non-transactional bonds with non-kin.

If friendship isn't just a social nicety, it must have evolutionary value. For kin relationships, the value lies in propagating one's genes, but friendship operates differently. Denworth suggests that friendship offers tangible survival benefits. For instance, people who are chronically lonely suffer worse health outcomes than those who are socially integrated. Friendship provides direct support, emotional connection, empathy, and shared information. It also exerts social pressure to conform to group norms—something that, while occasionally negative, generally has positive outcomes.

The role of friendship evolves across the human lifespan. For children, it centers on play. For teenagers, it becomes critical for learning independence from family; no other life stage places as much emphasis on friendship. For adults, family and professional obligations often overshadow friendships, which can drift to the periphery. However, for older adults, the importance of friendship resurges, correlating strongly with health and well-being.

In the latter chapters, Denworth examines how technological and societal changes affect friendship. Her argument can be summed up as: technology amplifies existing dynamics. When used to strengthen bonds, technology can be remarkably effective; when used to avoid connection, it can increase isolation. However, technology doesn't create these dynamics—it merely magnifies them.

Overall, *Friendship* is filled with compelling examples that make its case in an accessible and engaging manner. While the content occasionally feels repetitive, this book is an excellent introduction to the social brain, with a specific emphasis on the unique and enduring role of friendship.

Here's a revised version that maintains a slightly more casual tone while staying polished:

I’ll start by saying my rating here might be a little unfair. I’ve read a lot of other books about the social brain—both in the context of families and society—so much of this one felt like a refresher. It’s a well-written and well-structured refresher, but if you’re already familiar with this space and looking for fresh insights about what friendship adds to the picture, you might find the ratio of new to familiar ideas on the lower side.

That said, the book is definitely interesting. Lydia Denworth frames her exploration around evolutionary biology, making the case that friendship isn’t just a nice-to-have or a product of societal development—it’s fundamental to how humans survive and connect. One of her angles is showing how friendship-like behaviors—like taking comfort in the presence of specific non-kin—are found in a wide variety of animals, including fish. In primates, these behaviors evolve into something we’d clearly call friendship: long-term, positive, mutually beneficial, and non-transactional relationships with non-kin.

If friendship isn’t just a social nicety, it must provide real evolutionary value. Unlike kin relationships, it doesn’t directly help pass on genes (though Denworth does touch on how evolving in kin groups might have influenced friendship’s development). What we see is that friendship offers real survival benefits. People who are chronically lonely have worse health outcomes than those who are socially integrated. Friendship supports us in tangible ways—through emotional connection, empathy, practical help, and sharing information. Friends also create social pressure to conform to group norms, which can sometimes backfire but overall seems to have positive effects.

The role of friendship changes over the course of our lives. For children, it’s mostly about play. For teenagers, it becomes a critical way to learn independence from family; no other stage of life places as much importance on friendship. In adulthood, family and work relationships often take over, leaving friendship more in the background. But in later life, the importance of friendship rises again, becoming a major factor in health and well-being for older adults.

In the later chapters, Denworth explores how technological and societal shifts are reshaping friendship. The short version of her argument is that technology amplifies what’s already there. When used to deepen connections, it’s an incredibly effective tool. When used to avoid connection, it can heighten isolation. But technology doesn’t fundamentally create or destroy these dynamics—it just magnifies them.

Overall, *Friendship* is packed with examples that illustrate its points in an engaging and accessible way. While it does get a little repetitive at times, it’s a strong introduction to the social brain, with a focus on the unique and essential role friendship plays in our lives.
