The phrase "knuckle down" in a late nineteenth-century Canadian context likely carries a meaning similar to its general historical usage. This phrase typically means to get serious about a task, to work hard, or to apply oneself with earnest effort, often after a period of laxity or avoidance. 

In the context you've described, where it's something a person doesn't want to do because it goes against their pride, it suggests that the person is reluctantly applying themselves to a task or situation they'd rather avoid. This reluctance could stem from pride, a sense of dignity, or perhaps a distaste for the particular task at hand. The phrase encapsulates a moment of yielding or submitting to necessity, often with an underlying tension between one's desires and obligations. 

Such expressions were common in the literature of the time, reflecting themes of duty, perseverance, and the often challenging moral and social expectations of that era.
