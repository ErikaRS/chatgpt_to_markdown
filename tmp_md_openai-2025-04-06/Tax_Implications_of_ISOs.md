Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) are a type of employee stock option that can provide tax benefits to the recipient. However, the tax implications can be complex and are influenced by various factors including the timing of exercise and sale. Here's a general outline:

1. **Granting:**
    - There's no immediate tax implication when ISOs are granted.

2. **Exercising:**
    - At the time of exercise, there's no ordinary income tax.
    - However, the spread (the difference between the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise and the exercise price) is subject to Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).

3. **Selling:**
    - If the shares are sold after holding them for at least 1 year from the date of exercise and 2 years from the date of grant, any gain is taxed as long-term capital gains, which is generally at a lower rate than ordinary income.
    - If the shares are sold before meeting these holding requirements, the sale is a "disqualifying disposition," and any gain is taxed as ordinary income.

4. **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT):**
    - The spread between the exercise price and the fair market value at the time of exercise may trigger the AMT, which could result in a higher tax bill for the year of exercise.

5. **Death or Disability:**
    - Special rules may apply in the event of the employee's death or disability. 

To ensure compliance and understand all the tax implications, individuals should consult with a tax advisor. Tax laws and rates can change, and individual circumstances can significantly affect the tax treatment of ISOs.
