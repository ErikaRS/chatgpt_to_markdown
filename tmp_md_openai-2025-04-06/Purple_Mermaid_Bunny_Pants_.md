Creating mermaid bunny pants as described would involve a blend of costume design, tailoring, and material selection skills to achieve the whimsical, iridescent, and scaled appearance. Here's a basic guide on how to sew such pants and what materials to use for that magical, iridescent look:

### Materials Needed:

1. **Iridescent Fabric:** To achieve the shimmery, color-changing effect reminiscent of a mermaid's tail, look for iridescent fabrics. Options include holographic spandex, iridescent sequin fabric, or mermaid scale holographic fabric. These fabrics change color when viewed from different angles, perfect for mimicking the underwater shimmer.

2. **Bunny Ears Accents:** For the bunny motif, you might use a softer, complementary fabric like velvet or faux fur in a matching or contrasting color. These materials can be used to create the bunny ears that will protrude from the waistband.

3. **Lining Fabric:** Depending on the transparency and thickness of your main fabric, you might need a lining fabric. A lightweight satin or cotton can provide comfort and ensure the pants are not see-through.

4. **Elastic or Drawstring:** For the waistband, to ensure a snug fit.

5. **Interfacing:** To give structure to the bunny ears.

6. **Thread:** Choose a thread color that matches your main fabric.

7. **Sewing Supplies:** Sewing machine, fabric scissors, pins, measuring tape, fabric marker or chalk.

### Steps to Sew:

1. **Pattern Making:** Start by drafting or buying a mermaid tail pant pattern. Adjust the pattern to incorporate the bunny ears on the waistband. This might involve designing the ears separately and planning how they'll attach to the waistband.

2. **Cutting Fabric:** Lay out your iridescent fabric and use the pattern to cut the mermaid pant shape. Cut the bunny ears from the softer fabric, adding interfacing for stiffness.

3. **Sewing the Ears:** Sew the bunny ears with right sides together, leaving a base open for turning. Turn right side out and attach interfacing for structure. Attach the ears to the waistband area of your pants.

4. **Constructing the Pants:** Sew the pant legs together, following the mermaid shape. If you're using a lining, sew it as a separate piece and then attach it to the main fabric, treating them as one.

5. **Waistband:** Create a casing for the elastic or drawstring at the waistband, ensuring to securely attach the bunny ears in place.

6. **Finishing Touches:** Hem the bottom of the pants if necessary, and add any additional embellishments like sequins or beads for extra sparkle.

### Additional Tips:

- **Testing:** Given the unique materials and design, test your stitches and fabric behavior on scraps before sewing the actual pants.
- **Adjustments:** Fit the pants as you go, especially if you're working with stretchy fabric, to ensure a comfortable and flattering fit.

This project requires patience and creativity, especially when working with specialty fabrics and incorporating unique design elements like bunny ears. Enjoy the process of bringing this whimsical idea to life!
