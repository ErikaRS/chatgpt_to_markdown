As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, Susan Boyle is a Scottish singer who gained worldwide fame after her appearance on the reality TV show "Britain's Got Talent" in 2009. Her rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream" from the musical Les Mis√©rables quickly went viral and catapulted her to stardom. 

Following her breakthrough, Susan Boyle released multiple successful albums, including her debut album "I Dreamed a Dream" (2009), which became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time. She continued to make music and tour throughout the 2010s.

Since I don't have real-time information, I cannot provide an update on Susan Boyle's current activities as of May 2023. However, considering her passion for music, it is likely that she is still involved in the music industry in some capacity, whether it be through recording, touring, or making appearances on television shows and other events. To find the most recent information about her, I would recommend searching for news articles or visiting her official website or social media pages.
