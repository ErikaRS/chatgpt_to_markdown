Finish this last paragraph on a hopeful note. Keep the same overall tone. 

You know that important project ‚Äì the one that is existential to the success of your organization, the one that everyone has been discussing for months‚Ä¶ the one that hasn‚Äôt made any progress at all?

Many hairy organizational problems, the ones that don‚Äôt seem to make any progress despite everyone really wanting them to, have at their crux the misalignment of the capability, authority, and responsibility (CAR) for getting the thing done. Great organizational design brings these three factors as close as possible. When these things aren‚Äôt aligned, things seem to drag, go in circles, or perhaps go straight off the rails. 

Capability points to who is able to do the work. This is the person who knows the code base, understands the relevant legal codes, or knows how things are wired together (literally or metaphorically). If the work is not assigned to someone capable, then you are likely to end up in a situation where the work just can‚Äôt get done. The person responsible is unable to do it or, perhaps, they confidently rush ahead‚Ä¶ in the wrong direction. 

Authority points to who is able to make the work happen. This is the person who has (or can get) the resources and organizational clout to make the thing happen. When work is initiated by someone without authority, they might technically be able to do it (either directly or through delegating the work to someone else). However, they will be at risk of someone with authority coming along and vetoing the work.

Responsibility points to who gets the credit for the good or the bad that comes out of the work. This is not the person responsible for doing the work. Rather, this is the person who is accountable for the work. (But if we used accountable, we‚Äôd have two ‚Äúa‚Äùs üôÉ.) Without responsibility, there is little motivation to do the thing. Sometimes a person may be intrinsically motivated by the work, but in an organizational setting, the potential to get positive credit for work done plays a role. 

The ideal situation is when an organization is able to align capability, authority, and responsibility within the same unit (individual, team, division). In this situation, you are able to do it, no one can stop you, and you own the outcome too. Let‚Äôs go! However, what can you do if you‚Äôre missing some of these factors? 

If you‚Äôre missing capability, one approach is to work to build that capability, through training, hiring, borrowing expertise, etc. Another approach is to look for where there is sufficient capability and transfer the work to that person or group. This can be an incredibly effective approach‚Ä¶ if you are able to transfer the authority or responsibility along with it. Doing a partial transfer, where you try to hand off the work but retain the decision making power or the praise, often end up in stalemate. (Not surprisingly, it‚Äôs not too hard to convince people to hand off the responsibility for the negative consequences.)

If you‚Äôre lacking authority, you need to get it to avoid getting stuck in endless approval chains or relitigation of decisions that should have been long since settled. Two common failure modes for authority are when the nominal source of authority is not the actual authority or when the authority is at a distance from those who are capable of and responsible for the work. When authority is at a distance, the best thing to do is to see if sufficient authority can be transferred to those capable and responsible. This has to be done by the person with the authority, e.g., by say that within this realm that person has authority‚Ä¶ and then backing that up by trusting the decisions of the delegate. When nominal authority is separated from actual authority, things are more challenging. In this case, it may be that someone in another organization has veto power over some critical dependency. Sometimes you can work around that dependency ‚Äì e.g., by moving the dependency into your own organization. Other times, the external authority is unavoidable (e.g., a legal or security review). In that case, you need to work to get the distant authority on your side.

If you‚Äôre lacking responsibility ‚Äì and the work is something that needs more than just your intrinsic motivation ‚Äì you need to find a way to get some skin in the game. Can you find a way to make sure that success for the work translates into something positive for your organization? Perhaps counterintuitively, it‚Äôs just important to make sure you have responsibility for things going badly too. If you‚Äôre invested in something‚Äôs failure just as much as its success, you‚Äôll be more motivated to make sure it‚Äôs done right.  

You could be lacking more than one of these. The more CAR parts you‚Äôre missing, the harder it‚Äôs going to be for you to make progress. This is rarely the case at the beginning of a project. If a person or team only has one of capability, authority, or responsibility then the project is unlikely to get off the ground in the first place. 

However, CAR is not fixed. What the thing is often grows and changes. You can be capable of one thing ‚Äì e.g., building websites ‚Äì but the landscape changes ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to build iOS apps! You can lose authority; that new VP pulls rank on your director and all of a sudden they own the product area you‚Äôve been working in. You might lose responsibility, such as when a project keeps rolling on despite the market need for it having dissolved long ago. 

Capability, authority, and responsibility are dynamic.

Capability, authority, and responsibility are dynamic. Understanding this and taking proactive steps to realign these elements can revitalize even the most stalled projects. Start by clearly identifying where the gaps lie and take deliberate action to address them, whether that means building new skills, seeking out decision-making power, or ensuring proper accountability. With patience and persistence, you can reconfigure your team's CAR alignment and unlock new potential. Remember, every challenge is an opportunity for growth and improvement. By focusing on these core elements, you can transform obstacles into achievements, drive meaningful progress, and ultimately, lead your organization to success. So, let's tackle this head-on and turn those daunting projects into triumphant successes!
