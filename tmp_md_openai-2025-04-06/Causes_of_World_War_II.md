Why did world war 2 start?

World War II started due to a complex mix of reasons, many of which were rooted in the aftermath of World War I and the political, economic, and social conditions of the 1920s and 1930s. Here are some of the key reasons:

1. Treaty of Versailles: The peace treaty that ended World War I placed the blame for the war on Germany and Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). It imposed harsh financial reparations and territorial losses on Germany. Many Germans felt this treaty was unfair, which led to resentment and anger. 

2. Economic Instability: The 1920s and 1930s were marked by significant economic instability. The global Great Depression which started in 1929 caused severe economic hardship in many countries, including Germany, leading to high unemployment and poverty.

3. Rise of Totalitarian Regimes: The economic and social chaos of the post-WWI period and the Great Depression led to the rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan. Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party in Germany, Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party in Italy, and the militarist faction in Japan exploited the public's discontent and fears, leading to aggressive expansionist policies.

4. Appeasement: The policy of appeasement by Britain, France, and other powers towards Germany, Italy, and Japan in the 1930s is also often cited as a contributing factor. This policy, which included allowing Germany to remilitarize and annex the Sudetenland, and ignoring Japan's invasion of Manchuria, arguably emboldened these regimes and made war more likely.

5. Expansionist Policies: Both Germany and Japan had expansionist policies. Germany, under Hitler, sought to create a "Greater German Reich," which involved the annexation of surrounding territories and the subjugation or extermination of their peoples. Japan sought to establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," which involved the military conquest of much of East and Southeast Asia.

The war officially started on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later in response to the invasion. Over the next six years, the conflict would expand to involve most of the world's nations and result in the deaths of millions of people.

Who were the countries involved?

World War II was a global conflict that involved many nations, often divided into two primary alliances: the Allies and the Axis Powers.

The major **Allied Powers** included:

1. United Kingdom
2. Soviet Union (from June 1941)
3. United States (from December 1941)
4. China
5. France (although defeated in June 1940, Free French forces and colonies continued to fight on the side of the Allies)

Several other nations either joined the Allies or were occupied by them during the war, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, the countries of the British Commonwealth, and various European, African, and Asian countries.

The major **Axis Powers** included:

1. Germany
2. Italy (until September 1943, when it capitulated and joined the Allies)
3. Japan

Several other nations were either members of the Axis or were occupied by them, including Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland (co-belligerent against the Soviet Union), and others.

Several nations, including Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Turkey, remained neutral during the war, though they often had to navigate complex diplomatic and economic situations to maintain their neutrality.

The war began in Europe in September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland, and gradually expanded to include much of the world. It ended in Europe in May 1945 with Germany's unconditional surrender, and in Asia in September 1945 with Japan's surrender following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States.

What caused the end of the war?

World War II came to an end due to a combination of military defeat, strategic decisions, diplomatic maneuvers, and internal collapses within the Axis powers. 

In Europe:

1. **The Allied Invasion of Normandy (D-Day)**: On June 6, 1944, Allied forces launched a massive amphibious and airborne invasion of Normandy in northern France. This marked a turning point in the war, opening a Western Front and forcing Germany to fight on two fronts as it was already battling the Soviet Union in the east.

2. **Eastern Front and the Soviet Advance**: From 1943 onward, the Soviet Union started to push back the German forces, regaining control over its own territory and gradually advancing westward into Eastern Europe. This culminated in the Battle of Berlin in April-May 1945, which resulted in the capture of the German capital.

3. **Hitler's Suicide and Germany's Surrender**: On April 30, 1945, with Allied forces closing in on Berlin, Adolf Hitler committed suicide. His successor, Admiral Karl DÃ¶nitz, sought to negotiate a peace with the Allies, but they insisted on unconditional surrender. Germany officially surrendered on May 7, 1945.

In Asia and the Pacific:

1. **Island Hopping Campaign**: The United States pursued a "island hopping" strategy, capturing strategic islands one by one as they moved closer to Japan. This also involved devastating aerial bombardment of Japanese cities.

2. **Naval Battles**: Major naval battles, such as the Battle of Midway in 1942, resulted in significant losses for the Japanese fleet, hampering their ability to wage war effectively.

3. **Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki**: In August 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The unprecedented devastation and the prospect of further atomic attacks played a major role in Japan's decision to surrender.

4. **Soviet Declaration of War**: On August 8, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and launched an invasion of Japanese-controlled Manchuria. This further isolated Japan and strained its military resources.

5. **Japan's Surrender**: Following the atomic bombings and the Soviet entry into the war, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945. The formal surrender ceremony took place aboard the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945, officially marking the end of World War II.

These are broad strokes; the end of the war involved many more battles, events, and decisions, but these are some of the major milestones that led to the Axis powers' defeat.

Summarize all of those posts for a fourth grader

Absolutely, let me break it down into simpler terms:

World War II started because some countries were not happy about the rules made after World War I. The biggest of these countries was Germany, led by a man named Adolf Hitler. Hitler wanted Germany to be bigger and more powerful, and started taking over nearby countries. This upset a lot of other countries like Britain and France, so they declared war on Germany. This was the start of World War II.

Lots of countries were involved in the war. On one side, you had the Allies, which included Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and France. On the other side, you had the Axis, which was mainly Germany, Italy, and Japan.

The war ended because the Allies managed to defeat the Axis countries. In Europe, soldiers from the Allies landed in France (this is called D-Day) and started pushing Germany back from the west, while the Soviet Union pushed them back from the east. Eventually, Germany had to surrender.

In Asia, the United States was fighting Japan. They used a strategy called "island hopping," where they took over islands one by one to get closer to Japan. The United States also dropped two very big bombs (atomic bombs) on two cities in Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which caused a lot of damage. At the same time, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan too. All of this made Japan decide to surrender, which marked the end of World War II.
