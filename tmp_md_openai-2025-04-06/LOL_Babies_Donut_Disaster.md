Tell a funny story about the lol babies, Katie and eloin and darling and little queen bee and and Penny and Lizzie and Ellie, and their big sisters Snowflake and Lenny, getting donuts. It has to be funny.

One Saturday morning, the LOL Babies—Katie, Eloin, Darling, Little Queen Bee, Penny, Lizzie, and Ellie—woke up with a mission: **donuts.** Their big sisters, Snowflake and Lenny, had promised to take them to the donut shop, but there was one little problem. 

Lenny was **not** a morning person. 

When the LOL Babies charged into her room, yelling, “**TIME FOR DONUTS!**” Lenny just groaned and pulled the covers over her head. Snowflake, ever the responsible big sister, tried to wake her gently. 

“Lenny, come on, we promised. The babies are going to riot.”  

Lenny peeked out. “Tell them… they can have toast instead.”  

**Chaos erupted.**  

“TOAST?!” Little Queen Bee shrieked. “WHAT KIND OF MONSTER—”  

“TOAST IS JUST A BORING CRUNCHY PLATE!” shouted Darling.  

Ellie started **dramatically sobbing** into a pillow. Penny was already stuffing her shoes on the wrong feet in her desperation to leave.  

Realizing there was no escape, Lenny groaned and sat up. “Fine. But I’m not changing out of my pajamas.”  

And that’s how the group ended up at **Tippy’s Donut Delight**, a tiny shop run by a lady who looked like she had seen it all. Which, unfortunately for her, was about to change.  

The LOL Babies **could not decide.**  

Katie wanted a **pink sprinkle donut.** But **also** a **chocolate-filled one.** But **also** a **blue one that looked like it was made of magic.**  

Lizzie wanted **a donut as big as her face.**  

Darling wanted a donut but **only if it could sing a song.**  

Little Queen Bee insisted on **negotiating a deal.** “If I get two donuts now, I will agree to behave for the next **ten minutes.**”  

Eloin wasn’t even looking at the donuts. She was just **staring at the ceiling fan, mesmerized.**  

Meanwhile, Penny had gotten **stuck in the display case.**  

Snowflake was trying to maintain order, but Lenny was too busy drinking coffee with **both hands.**  

After **seventeen full minutes of debate,** they finally got their donuts. But then…  

**Ellie dropped hers.**  

And when I say dropped, I mean she dramatically gasped, fumbled it like a football, spun in a full circle, and then **launched it across the store.**  

It landed directly on **Lenny’s forehead.**  

Everyone **froze.**  

Lenny blinked. Then, **without breaking eye contact, she took a bite of the donut off her own forehead.**  

The LOL Babies **lost their minds.**  

“LENNY IS A GENIUS!”  

“WE HAVE TO LEARN THIS TECHNIQUE!”  

“IT’S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE!”  

At this point, Tippy the donut shop lady sighed and muttered, “I should have been a dentist.”  

And that’s how the LOL Babies got **banned from Tippy’s Donut Delight for a full week.**  

(But they all agreed it was **totally worth it.**)

It should be a person fleeing a donut. Remove the donut person. There are no donut people. There are just people and donuts separately
