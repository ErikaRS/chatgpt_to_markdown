Slim this down:
Here's where I'm thinking from: I don't want to make busywork. 

However, I generally think of projects as having two audiences: the team and the interested stakeholders outside the team. I have experienced gotten feedback that it's confusing for folks outside of projects that projects seem to go on forever when there are only cleanup tasks remaining. 

I suspect that if milestones in Linear were more first class, then we could utilize them to convey the more nuanced message that a project is done in terms of the user visible aspects but still has some cleanup work to do. But they aren't. (That's a separate rant.) So my general preference is toward being willing to break projects into pieces, with cleanup generally as a separate phase.

Thoughts?

Here's a more concise version:

I don't want to create busywork, but I do see projects as having two audiences: the team and interested stakeholders outside the team. I've received feedback that it's confusing for stakeholders when projects seem to drag on, even if only cleanup tasks are left.

If milestones in Linear were more prominent, we could use them to clarify that user-facing work is done while cleanup is ongoing. Since they aren't, my preference is to break projects into phases, with cleanup as its own distinct phase.

Thoughts?
