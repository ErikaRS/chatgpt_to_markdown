Draft up a short (1-3 paragraph) document of role expectations for someone taking on an "uber TL" role for a 15 person org with two closely related partner orgs. 

Here are raw notes on the verbal conversation about the role

On the Cody side, what is E looking for 
	- E: Identifying gaps, reducing overlaps, making sure we are set up to move more quickly
	- How many people are on Cody?
	- E: About 14, not counting AI
	- Includes PM and design?
	- E: That adds about 6 more.
	- Codium is a fair comparison (unlike cursor). They support many editors like we do. 
	- Does agree that we need to pay down some of the technical debt. 
	- Idea is that we'll have someone do this?
	- E: Yes, plus also working on breaking down some of the team boundaries
	- Is excited about this possibility. Knows a lot about what's going on down on the ground. Has tried to not get involved in anything, but knows things he would do if he had this. 
	- Won't be shuffling headcount around. That's management's job. Just trying to make the most out of the existing people and teams we have. And identify recommendations where we can do better. 
	- Everyone has hypotheses about what's going on. We'll figure it out.
	- As Olaf mentioned in DM, a lot of it comes down to product management. 
	- Helped Ron draft Linear RFC. It's not that we can't solve it with GitHub issues, but we've tried.
	- Will need to learn more, e.g., about the Control Plane team
	- E: Analytics, Accounts, Billing, Abuse, Rate Limiting
	- Also AI as a sibling. Can do better there.

**Role Expectations Document: Uber Team Lead (TL)**

The Uber Team Lead (TL) role is a strategic and operational position designed to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and innovation within a 15-person organization and its two partner organizations. The primary focus of the Uber TL will be to identify and bridge gaps, reduce overlaps, and streamline processes to accelerate our collective capability to deliver high-quality services and products.

As Uber TL, your responsibilities will include:
- **Gap Identification and Overlap Reduction:** Assess the current team structures and workflows to identify areas of redundancy and gaps in our capabilities. You will work closely with team leads and management to ensure that resources are optimally allocated, and efforts are not duplicated.
- **Enhancing Team Integration:** Actively work on breaking down silos between teams to foster a more collaborative environment. This will involve understanding the specific functions and interdependencies of different teams including Product Management, Design, Analytics, Accounts, Billing, Abuse, and Rate Limiting. Your goal will be to facilitate seamless interaction and knowledge sharing across these groups.

### Assistant - 2024-04-30 10:59:09

Your concise version effectively captures the essence of the Uber TL role at Cody, with a clear emphasis on collaboration, innovation, and efficiency. Here's some feedback to refine it further:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Consider using bullet points for the primary responsibilities and goals to improve readability and impact. This helps in quickly conveying key expectations and makes the document more scannable.

2. **Role Boundaries**: The statement "They will not be responsible for improving program management and team structures, but they will work closely with TPM and management to do so" could be confusing. It might be clearer to state explicitly that they will influence these areas through collaboration rather than direct control.

3. **Specificity in Goals**: The goals are broadly stated but could benefit from being more specific or providing examples of what success looks like. For instance, when mentioning "improve our ability to iterate quickly," specify what kinds of bottlenecks (e.g., in deployment cycles or decision-making processes) will be targeted.

4. **Consistency in Terminology**: Ensure consistency in how teams and roles are referred to (e.g., "TPM" could be spelled out as "Technical Program Management" if not widely recognized by the intended audience). This avoids ambiguity.

5. **Action-Oriented Language**: Some sentences could be made more dynamic and action-oriented. For example, "Give input onto broader strategic direction" could be rephrased to "Actively shape the broader strategic direction of the organization."

Here's a revised version incorporating this feedback:
