What's funny about the question, "why is the sun always up at the crack of dawn?"?

The question is humorous because it contains a logical fallacy. The phrase "crack of dawn" actually refers to the moment when the sun begins to rise and the sky begins to lighten, rather than when the sun is already up in the sky. Therefore, it is a bit absurd to ask why the sun is always up at the crack of dawn when the sun's rising is precisely what defines that moment. It's a bit like asking why water is always wet.
