Copy edit this to be more aligned with my style and other book summaries I have written?

_The Duke Who Didn't_ is a delightful take on the crowded historical romance field. It's set, like so many, in England, but with a twist: through an accident of history, the village of Wedgeford is populated by immigrants, many of whom are of east Asian descent. While I love me a good anachronistic dose of diversity in novels, it's also refreshing to find a novel that manages to bring in some variety in a way that feels authentic to history. (I'm not saying this would pass a deep historical review, but it passes the sniff test for average readers who have read novels that were written in the 18th-early 20th centuries.)

But all that would mean little if it weren't a good romance, and it is! I love Chloe, her serious competent side, her awkwardness, her passion. I love Jeremy for the way his character deepens throughout the novel. The novel hits a nice balance of sweet and steamy, and the plot beyond the romance is interesting in its own right. 

Overall, this was an excellent read. But be warned... if you go into reading it hungry, you're going to come out even more hungry. The food descriptions are dangerous!

_The Duke Who Didn't_ offers a refreshing and unique take on the historical romance genre. Set in England, like many novels in this space, it stands out with a compelling twist: the village of Wedgeford is populated by immigrants, many of whom are of East Asian descent. This aspect of the story brings a sense of authenticity to its diversity, blending historical elements with a more inclusive narrative. While it may not meet the standards of rigorous historical accuracy, it feels plausible enough for readers familiar with novels from the 18th to early 20th centuries.

At its heart, however, this is a romance, and a well-executed one at that. Chloe, the heroine, is wonderfully multifaceted—serious and competent, yet awkward and passionate. Jeremy, her romantic counterpart, becomes increasingly layered as the story progresses. The novel strikes a satisfying balance between sweetness and steam, and the plot outside the romance is engaging in its own right.

Overall, _The Duke Who Didn't_ is a thoroughly enjoyable read. One word of caution: if you start the book hungry, the vivid food descriptions will leave you craving even more!

My fiction reviews tend to be lighter weight, so edit this again, going for a more light, casual style that is consistent with my overall tone. Keep the original as much as possible. Mostly refine what is there.

_The Duke Who Didn't_ is a charming addition to the historical romance genre. It’s set in England, like many others, but with a fun twist: the village of Wedgeford is home to immigrants, many of whom are of East Asian descent, thanks to a little quirk of history. I’m all for a bit of anachronistic diversity in novels, but this one manages to weave it in so naturally that it feels like it fits. (Okay, maybe not for a hardcore historian, but for those of us who’ve read plenty of 18th- and 19th-century novels, it works.)

Of course, a good twist isn’t enough without a great romance, and this one delivers. Chloe is fantastic—serious and competent, but also awkward and full of passion. Jeremy is the perfect match, and I loved how his character grew as the story went on. The book strikes a great balance between sweet and steamy, and the plot has enough going on beyond the romance to keep things interesting.

All in all, this was a fun, satisfying read. Just a heads-up: if you start reading it hungry, the food descriptions will make you even hungrier!
