Higher quality results deliver value to users but it can be hard to express how because the quality is distributed in small bits everywhere. How do we express the value of quality improvements to users?

### Assistant - 2023-07-01 07:43:47

Expressing the value of quality improvements can be challenging, particularly when improvements are small or distributed throughout a product or service. Here are a few strategies you could use:

1. **Tangible Benefits**: Translate the quality improvements into concrete, tangible benefits for the user. For example, if the changes have resulted in a 10% speed improvement in your app, express that in terms of saved time over a day, month, or year. Use real-life comparisons if possible. 

2. **Visual Demonstrations**: Use before-and-after scenarios, side-by-side comparisons, or demo videos to visually demonstrate the improvements. This can help users see the differences in quality, even if they are small or distributed.

3. **Storytelling**: Tell a story that highlights the benefits of these improvements. This could be a user scenario that depicts how the quality improvements will make the user's life easier, more productive, or more enjoyable.

4. **Testimonials & Case Studies**: Show how other users have benefited from these quality improvements. Real-world stories can be powerful evidence of value.

5. **Transparent Communication**: Share details about the process you've gone through to make these improvements. This openness can increase users' trust in your commitment to quality.

6. **Highlight Impact over Features**: Instead of focusing on features, focus on the impact of the improvements. How do these improvements affect the overall user experience?

7. **Relate to User Goals**: Understand what the users' primary goals are in using your product/service and highlight how these improvements help them achieve those goals more effectively or efficiently.

Remember, the ultimate goal is to make sure users understand that your product or service is continuously improving, meeting their needs better, saving them time, or making their life easier. Effective communication about quality improvements can significantly enhance users' appreciation of your product or service and their overall user experience.

Can you update the PR to include this? Let me know if you need any information first

The rest of these are great ideas too. 

### Assistant - 2023-07-01 09:14:09

Sure, I'd love to include this information in the PR. Before I do, I have a few questions to ensure the updated PR accurately reflects these improvements:

1. Can you share more details about this fine-tuned model? For instance, what are the specific code use cases it's been trained on? 

2. Can you provide some metrics or statistics that quantify the improvement in quality on your test data set?

3. How does the reduction in the size of the embeddings generation and increased efficiency benefit the end user? Does it result in faster responses or more accurate code completion and bug detection?

4. Does the fine-tuned model support all programming languages, or are there specific languages that it excels in?

5. Are there any new capabilities that the fine-tuned model has, which the previous one did not?

6. Finally, has this new model already been rolled out, or is it coming in a future update? If the latter, when can users expect to start benefiting from these improvements?

### User - 2023-07-01 09:17:43

The fine tuned model has been trained on code specific data which consists of natural language queries paired with code that is labeled as relevant or not relevant to the query. The training data is in multiple programming languages.

I don't have the specific numbers on hand, but the fine tuned model does better on various measures such as having more relevant results in the top 20 results, having better ordering of the results within that set, and finding more accurate examples from the overall dataset.

The reduction in size benefits the user in two ways. At time of use, it makes responses faster with an increase in quality. It also allows the system to scale up and serve larger repositories, scaling up from 6GB of code data to 20GB. 

The fine-tuned model supports all mainstream programming languages. It does not have net new capabilies. It's just better. 

### Assistant - 2023-07-01 09:18:15

Creating a good news article headline is a crucial skill as it's the first thing readers see and can be a decisive factor in whether they choose to read the article or not. Here are some characteristics of a compelling headline:

1. **Conciseness**: Keep it short and sweet. A good headline should convey the essence of the article in a succinct manner. Too many words can make it look crowded and confusing.

2. **Clarity**: Avoid jargon, complicated words, or convoluted phrases. The headline should be easy to understand at a glance.

3. **Accuracy**: The headline must accurately reflect the content of the article. Misleading or clickbait headlines can harm your credibility.

4. **Engaging**: Use compelling language to pique the reader's interest. However, avoid sensationalism or hyperbole.

5. **Keyword usage**: If the article is for an online publication, including relevant keywords can improve its visibility in search engine results.

6. **Uniqueness**: A unique headline stands out more than a generic one. Try to highlight what's distinctive about your article.

7. **Actionable language**: If applicable, using actionable language can make a headline more compelling. For example, using verbs can convey a sense of momentum.

8. **Provocative**: A good headline can challenge assumptions or ask a thought-provoking question, making readers curious to know more.

Remember, the best headlines not only draw readers in but also give them a clear idea of what they can expect from the article. The right balance of information and intrigue is key.

What reading level should an industry PR target?

### Assistant - 2023-07-06 13:58:40

The appropriate reading level for a press release largely depends on the industry and the target audience. However, it's generally recommended to aim for a reading level equivalent to that of an average 8th grader in the United States, which is around 13 to 14 years old. This is approximately a Flesch-Kincaid readability score of 60 to 70, which corresponds to fairly easy to moderately difficult text.

This level is aimed to be understood by the broadest range of people. Even if your industry is highly technical or specialized, it's important to remember that press releases are often read by a wide variety of individuals, including journalists who may not have a deep background in your specific field. 

Furthermore, clear and simple language can help ensure your message is understood quickly and accurately, which is particularly important given that readers often skim press releases. 

Of course, depending on the complexity of the topic and the intended audience, there may be some variability. It might be necessary to use industry-specific terms or jargon, but these should be clearly explained or defined to ensure accessibility for a wider audience.

This press release provides a clear narrative and a comprehensive picture of the improved Cody from Sourcegraph. It uses specific examples and metrics to demonstrate the improvements and to give readers an understanding of how the new features may benefit them. The tone is enthusiastic and encouraging which helps to generate excitement about the new upgrades.

That said, there's room for some improvements:

1. **Clarity:** The press release is generally clear but has a few sentences that could be clarified for better understanding. For example, "Meet Cody from Sourcegraph, your AI-powered coding assistant. Driven by our desire to amplify developer productivity, we’ve strengthened Cody’s most valued features." The relationship between "Meet Cody" and "Driven by our desire" is a bit unclear. Also, the phrase "developers to enhance it" in the first sentence is ambiguous – it's not clear what "it" refers to.

2. **Level of Detail:** The detail level is generally appropriate, but there might be too much technical detail in certain areas that could be simplified or explained further, such as the section about hybrid search functionality and AI embeddings model.

3. **Level of Excitement:** The press release is engaging and successfully generates a level of excitement about the Cody upgrades. The language is positive and the benefits of the new features are well highlighted. 

4. **Reading Level:** While generally understandable, the reading level is a bit high due to the use of some technical and industry-specific terms. Simplifying the language and explaining complex ideas in a more straightforward manner could make the text more accessible to a wider audience. For example, instead of "AI embeddings model fine-tuned for code and improved code preprocessing", perhaps something along the lines of "improved AI model specifically designed for better code understanding" could be used.

5. **Flow and Structure:** The structure could be improved to ensure a more logical flow of information. The press release seems to jump back and forth between discussing different features. Organizing the information in a more systematic manner can improve the reader's understanding.

6. **Closing:** The closing paragraph could be stronger. A call to action or a look to the future could round off the press release in a more compelling way.

Overall, the press release is well done but with a few tweaks, it could be even more effective in conveying the excitement around the Cody upgrade and its potential benefits for developers.
