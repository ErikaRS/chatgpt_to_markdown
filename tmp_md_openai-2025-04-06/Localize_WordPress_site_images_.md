My wordpress site has pointers to images hosted elsewhere. How can I create local copies of all those images?

There are several ways to accomplish this task. 

One approach is to use a WordPress plugin specifically designed for this purpose. Here's a step-by-step guide using the Auto Upload Images plugin:

1. Install and activate the Auto Upload Images plugin:
   - Go to your WordPress dashboard.
   - Navigate to "Plugins > Add New".
   - Search for "Auto Upload Images".
   - Click "Install Now", then "Activate".

2. Once activated, this plugin will automatically replace external image URLs in your posts with the corresponding locally hosted versions.
   - It works every time you save or update a post, scanning the content for image URLs and uploading a copy of those images to your WordPress media library.
   - The plugin then replaces the external image URLs in your post with the new local URLs.

Please note that if you have a large number of images, you should be aware that this process might use significant server resources.

Alternatively, you can do it manually by writing a script that uses a web scraping library, such as Python's Beautiful Soup or Scrapy, to download all images and then upload them to your server. Then, update the image URLs in your posts. However, this method requires programming knowledge.

Lastly, always ensure that you have the rights to host these images on your server. Copying images without permission can lead to copyright infringement.
