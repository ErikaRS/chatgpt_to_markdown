What are a list of skills to give to a recruiter to use for filtering candidates for an infra EM role who will run a dev infra team and a releases team? Core technology we already list are kubernetes, docker, terraform, helm, bazel. Note that the goal is a list of criteria where we want candidates to have at least one of, not all of them, so it's better to be broad than narrow.

The user is working on a list of skills for a recruiter to use for filtering candidates for an infrastructure engineering manager (EM) role, who will run a Dev Infra team and a Releases team. Core technologies include Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Helm, and Bazel. The goal is to provide broad criteria where candidates should have at least one of the skills listed, not all of them.

For the infrastructure engineering manager (EM) role overseeing both a Dev Infra team and a Releases team, here's a broad list of skills that a recruiter can use for filtering candidates. These are designed so candidates should have at least one or a few of the skills, but not necessarily all:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Management:**
   - Experience with managing and scaling continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or equivalent).

2. **Cloud Infrastructure Expertise:**
   - Familiarity with AWS, GCP, Azure, or other major cloud platforms, particularly in managing infrastructure at scale.

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
   - Experience with infrastructure automation tools beyond Terraform, such as Ansible, Pulumi, or CloudFormation.

4. **Container Orchestration:**
   - Experience managing large-scale Kubernetes clusters or other container orchestration platforms.

5. **Release Engineering:**
   - Familiarity with version control systems (Git) and release pipelines, ideally having experience in optimizing and automating release processes.

6. **System Monitoring and Observability:**
   - Experience with monitoring, logging, and tracing tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or ELK stack).

7. **Configuration Management:**
   - Experience with tools like Chef, Puppet, SaltStack, or similar systems.

8. **Build Systems Expertise:**
   - Experience with build automation tools such as Bazel, Jenkins, or custom build systems.

9. **Security & Compliance in Infrastructure:**
   - Understanding of security best practices in cloud and infrastructure, including network security, encryption, and compliance frameworks like SOC 2, GDPR, or HIPAA.

10. **Leadership and People Management:**
    - Experience in leading distributed teams and familiarity with agile or DevOps cultures.

11. **Release Management Tools:**
    - Experience with tools like Helm for managing deployments in Kubernetes, or alternative package management systems for cloud-native applications.

12. **SRE and DevOps Practices:**
    - Familiarity with site reliability engineering (SRE) practices or the DevOps movement, including improving system reliability and scalability.

13. **Automation and Scripting:**
    - Proficiency in automation through scripting languages such as Python, Bash, Go, or similar.

14. **High-Availability Systems:**
    - Experience with building and maintaining highly available, fault-tolerant systems.

15. **Scaling Infrastructure:**
    - Experience in scaling infrastructure for high-growth environments, including both horizontal and vertical scaling strategies.

This broad set of skills allows for flexibility in filtering candidates while ensuring they bring relevant experience to key areas.
