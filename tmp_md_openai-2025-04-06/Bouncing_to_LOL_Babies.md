One bright morning, Rat, Cat, and their magical friends—Sealy the pink seal and Minty the bunnycorn—hopped into their tiny, questionably road-legal car. It was a bright yellow convertible that somehow fit all of them, despite physics having strong objections. They were off to visit their besties, the LOL Babies: Little Queen Bee, Penny, Elowin, Darling, and Katie.  

Rat, who had claimed the driver’s seat (despite being the smallest), adjusted his sunglasses. “Buckle up, everyone!” he squeaked, stepping on the gas. The car lurched forward with the speed of a confused shopping cart.  

Cat, perched in the passenger seat, rolled their eyes. “I told you, we should’ve let me drive.”  

“We’re literally going five miles an hour,” Minty said, flicking her sparkly bunnycorn tail.  

Sealy, in the back, clapped her flippers. “WHEEEE! This is the FASTEST I’VE EVER GONE!”  

Halfway there, the car made a dramatic *clunk* noise and stopped.  

“Oh no,” said Rat, hopping out and lifting the hood. “Our engine is full of glitter.”  

Everyone turned to Minty. She shuffled her hooves. “Okay, so maybe I tried to ‘improve’ our car by sprinkling some magic in it.”  

Cat groaned. “That is NOT how engines work.”  

Sealy, always the optimist, flopped onto the ground. “Let’s just bounce the rest of the way!”  

And that’s how a rat, a cat, a pink seal, and a bunnycorn ended up pogo-sticking all the way to their friends’ house while pushing their glitter-infused, completely useless car. When they finally arrived, Little Queen Bee, Penny, Elowin, Darling, and Katie stared at them in silence.  

“You guys *bounced* here?” Penny asked.  

“Uh-huh,” said Sealy proudly.  

“…And your car?” Katie pointed to the sad, glittery heap.  

“Minty did it,” Rat and Cat said in unison.  

The LOL Babies burst out laughing. “BEST ENTRANCE EVER!”  

And from that day forward, no one let Minty near an engine again.

A vibrant, playful illustration captures the chaotic but heartwarming arrival of the friends at the LOL Babies' house. The scene features a small, glitter-covered yellow convertible car, slightly broken down on a cheerful, winding road. 

Standing proudly next to the car is a tiny rat wearing sunglasses, looking triumphant despite the situation. A cool-looking cat sits nearby with an unimpressed expression, tail flicking. Sealy, a pink seal, flops joyfully on the ground, completely unbothered by the mishap. Minty, the bunnycorn—a bunny with a unicorn horn and a sparkly tail—stands nearby, looking guilty, knowing that her magic may have caused the car's engine failure. 

In the background, a cute, colorful house with whimsical decorations welcomes them. Standing at the doorstep are five small, doll-like children, the LOL Babies—Little Queen Bee, Penny, Elowin, Darling, and Katie—laughing and pointing at the group's unconventional arrival. Their expressions range from delight to surprise as they take in the sight of their glittery, pogo-sticked friends. 

The overall atmosphere is bright and cheerful, with a cartoonish, exaggerated style that highlights the silliness of the moment. The sky is a soft pastel blue, and the landscape
