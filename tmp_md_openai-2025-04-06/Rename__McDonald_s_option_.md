I got feedback that the name "McDonald's option" in this lens is elitist. What are alternatives? 

This week’s lens: the McDonald’s option.

“Where should we go for lunch?” This is an eternally unsolvable question, made worse by the dynamics of the vetocracy. The lunch question shares properties with many interminable debates: people have different goals and criteria, there’s no obvious or dominant option, and it’s not clear who is the decider. How can we move these sorts of conversations forward? 

Our colleague Cezary shared one technique: the McDonald’s option. A McDonald’s option is an option which people are good with but which is not necessarily their top choice. In our lunch example, if a group is having trouble coming up with options, asking “What if we go to McDonald’s?” will stimulate people to come up with alternatives they like better. 

McDonald’s options work because they create an artificial best alternative to a negotiated agreement. By introducing a default option that will be the choice unless folks can agree on something better, people are motivated to come up with something better. Once multiple options are on the table, the group can evaluate them and make a choice.

Introducing a McDonald’s option does not work when there are strong conflicting opinions. In those situations, adding a McDonald’s option just adds noise. Rather, a McDonald’s option is valuable when a group has a bunch of weakly held opinions and needs to be pushed from discussion to decision. Be warned though, sometimes the McDonald’s option becomes the actual choice: would you like fries with that?

The term "McDonald's option" in your context refers to a default choice used to stimulate decision-making in a group with varied preferences. If the name "McDonald's option" seems elitist or inappropriate for your audience, you might consider renaming it to something more neutral and inclusive. Here are a few alternative suggestions:

1. **The Default Option**: This term is straightforward and non-specific, indicating a standard choice that serves as a starting point for discussions.

2. **The Common Ground Choice**: This emphasizes finding a choice that, while not perfect for everyone, serves as a common starting point for decision-making.

3. **The Catalyst Choice**: This term highlights the role of the option in catalyzing decision-making, prompting the group to consider other alternatives.

4. **The Baseline Option**: Similar to 'default', this implies a basic, starting level option from which to build or deviate.

5. **The Starter Suggestion**: This term indicates that the option is just a starting point for discussion, not necessarily the final decision.

6. **The Conversation Starter**: This emphasizes the option's role in initiating dialogue and breaking decision-making deadlocks.

Each of these alternatives maintains the original concept's essence without associating with a specific brand or implying any judgment about the choice's quality.
