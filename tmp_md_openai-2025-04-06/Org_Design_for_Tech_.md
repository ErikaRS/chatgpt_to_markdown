Designing Dynamic Organizations: A Hands-On Guide for Leaders at All Levels, written by Jay Galbraith, Diane Downey, and Amy Kates, was published in 2002. Although the book is more than two decades old, the fundamental concepts it covers can still be relevant for leaders in any industry, including technology.

The book focuses on the importance of designing an organization's structure and processes to achieve its strategic goals. It provides a detailed framework called the Star Model, which includes five key components:

1. Strategy: The direction and goals of the organization
2. Structure: How the organization is divided and how roles and responsibilities are distributed
3. Processes: The methods by which work gets done within the organization
4. People: The talent and human resources needed to execute the strategy
5. Rewards: The systems and incentives that motivate employees to perform at their best

As a leader in a technology company, you can still find value in these concepts, especially considering the rapid pace of change in the tech industry. Understanding the importance of organizational design and aligning it with your company's strategic goals can help you adapt to the dynamic nature of the industry, manage growth, and remain competitive.

That said, it's also important to complement the insights from Designing Dynamic Organizations with more recent resources that address the unique challenges and opportunities that technology companies face. There are many newer books, articles, and research studies available that discuss organizational design, agile methodologies, and digital transformation in the context of modern technology companies.
