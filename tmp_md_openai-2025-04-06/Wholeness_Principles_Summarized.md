Christopher Alexander's principles of wholeness are a set of 15 properties that he identifies as recurring features in things that have life and beauty. These principles are detailed in his book "The Nature of Order." Here are the principles:

1. **Levels of Scale:** The presence of structures at different scales, contributing to a sense of proportion and coherence.
2. **Strong Centers:** A strong center is formed by elements that reinforce each other’s existence and contribute to the whole.
3. **Boundaries:** Clear boundaries help to define centers and contribute to the integrity of the whole.
4. **Alternating Repetition:** Patterns that repeat with variation create rhythm and harmony.
5. **Positive Space:** All space, including the background, is shaped and meaningful.
6. **Good Shape:** Shapes that are simple, coherent, and well-proportioned contribute to wholeness.
7. **Local Symmetries:** Symmetries that occur locally enhance the overall structure without enforcing rigid uniformity.
8. **Deep Interlock and Ambiguity:** Elements that interpenetrate and overlap create a dynamic and integrated whole.
9. **Contrast:** Differences in elements that highlight and reinforce each other’s properties.
10. **Gradients:** Gradual changes that contribute to a sense of growth and transformation.
11. **Roughness:** Imperfections that enhance the authenticity and character of the whole.
12. **Echoes:** Recurring motifs and themes that create a sense of unity and resonance.
13. **The Void:** Empty spaces that allow other elements to breathe and be more fully appreciated.
14. **Simplicity and Inner Calm:** The presence of simplicity and tranquility that contributes to the overall feeling of calm and coherence.
15. **Not-Separateness:** The integration and connectedness of elements, avoiding a sense of isolation or fragmentation.

These principles are intended to guide the design of spaces, buildings, and objects to create environments that feel more alive and whole.

Create a wordless geometric abstract grey scale image in a 16:9 aspect ratio which follows these principles

### Assistant - 2024-05-27 18:29:20

{
  "prompt": "A wordless geometric abstract grayscale image in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The design should follow the principles of wholeness by Christopher Alexander: including levels of scale with various shapes at different sizes, strong centers with focal points, clear boundaries defining areas, alternating repetition creating rhythm, positive space where all areas are meaningful, good shape with simple and well-proportioned forms, local symmetries, deep interlock and ambiguity with overlapping elements, contrast with light and dark areas, gradients showing gradual changes, roughness with imperfections, echoes with recurring motifs, the void with empty spaces, simplicity and inner calm, and not-separateness with connected elements.",
