I am giving feedback to someone who draws hard boundaries between organizations which doesn't work well in a small, dynamic, fast moving company. Give several ideas (1 sentence each) for how I can communicate the negative impact of creating these boundaries?

1. "Creating rigid boundaries can limit our ability to adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities, which is essential in our dynamic environment."
2. "The boundaries you're drawing between departments are creating silos that hinder our team's collaboration and the flow of information."
3. "Such hard boundaries can lead to inefficiencies, as they prevent us from leveraging the diverse skills and perspectives that exist across the company."
4. "By segmenting the organization rigidly, we risk duplicating efforts and missing out on synergies that could drive innovation and growth."
5. "These boundaries are making it difficult for teams to support each other, leading to delays and frustration that could affect our overall performance."
6. "Fostering a more integrated approach can enhance our agility, allowing us to respond more effectively to the fast-paced market we operate in."
