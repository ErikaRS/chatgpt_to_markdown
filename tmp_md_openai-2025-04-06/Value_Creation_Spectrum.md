Turn these notes into 1-4 paragraph "lens" piece on value creation / value capture which emphasizes two key points: (1) Abundance creates value. Relative scarcity in abundance captures value. Absolute scarcity destroys value and (2) This is really more of a spectrum than a binary.

The form of the article should be roughly: 
1. Illustrative example, 1-3 sentences
2. Definition of concepts plus interesting angle, 1-2 paragraphs
3. Ways to apply this, 1 paragraph

I've been thinking about this for awhile, and am curious if it resonates.

value-making / value-taking.  You're sitting in a smoke-filled room full of sales people selling what people call "rags" on Fifth Avenue. The person next to you is a 50-something housewife who handles half a dozen brands from designer labels to things you would find in liquidation in Target. She runs the place because she's developed a vertically integrated supply chain. On Tuesday she's asking how she can get more cuts into the same square of fabric. She's part of the value-making part of the business. Two weeks later, the gloss and sheen of that Fifth Avenue boutique will present her masterpieces as works of art, but she's too busy to care, since all that glamour is just a necessary part of the value-making supply chain. 

Value-making: Dotting the suburbs of London and Paris are pastry factories, bakeries and food processing companies. Each one has an enormous operation. Value-taking: every Paris-Brest and yuzu eclair delicately placed on Rosenthal plates, each ham and cheese croissant summarily pressed and reheated for people traveling through the city center. This is just another example of globalization, but on a micro-scale.

Impressive you've hit on this independently. It's a very real, and very-used lens at least in Venture Capital, and probably elsewhere too: Value Creation vs. Value Capture. 

Seems like you're adding in value-taking, which rhymes a lot with economic rent-seeking.

These are potent lenses. E.g. you can split the intractable "billionares shouldn't exist" culture war thing into "abolish rent-seeking", not "abolish bilionaires"
(I mean, you won't actually split the culture war on it, because the conflation is the point, as it attracts angry people on both sides and keeps the fight going)
Jon — 08/25/2023 10:20 AM
yeah I think value capture is perhaps a better framing. What I find particularly interesting about this lens is the kind of discontinuity in geography and context.
many years back I was doing a thing with a london based sushi chain (rhymes with Mitsu), and this challenge came to the fore in a remarkable way—sushi had to be prepared on prem, whereas almost everything that people in london eat comes from a suburb and is frozen, reheated and plated since there's simply no real estate for anything else. 
there's also a huge skill deficit—you have michelin-star chefs working in windowless food plants, and relatively low-skilled folks presenting their creations
Ben Mathes — 08/25/2023 11:31 AM
the aphorism level around all this: Abundance creates value. Relative scarcity in abundance captures value. Absolute scarcity destroys value.
e.g. the web: abundance of information. google search i.e. discovery is relative scarcity in that abundance.
rent seeking is a version of absolute scarcity. E.g. "only 3 licensed realtors in this town" or "only X taxi medallions" 
Jon — 08/25/2023 11:54 AM
would you say that "extreme rent seeking" ends up creating a whale fall?
Ben Mathes — 08/25/2023 12:01 PM
It certainly can, if the rent-seeker was a past value-creator/capturer that pivots to rent-seeking, and then dies slowly and the productive people move off to do other things
no idea how common it is, in either way
but some forms of rent-seeking just put chokeholds on sectors of the economy
licensing regimes and other forms of regulatory capture, for example
Erika RS — 08/25/2023 8:02 PM
You two should write something 😉
Ben Mathes — 08/28/2023 3:52 PM
I've drafted some personal blog things... I can't crack this nut. Anything I write is either:


so abstract that it's banal
picks a concrete example of rent-seeking vs. value-creation and will incite flamewars.
e.g. nobody is willing to admit they are rent-seeking. No, they are Adding Value in indirect, nuanced ways. How dare you insult me.

In the bustling heart of a metropolitan city, a 50-something entrepreneur manages a boutique filled with designer labels and budget finds, squeezing every bit of value out of a square of fabric. This vivid scene underscores the fundamental dynamics of value creation versus value capture in the economy, illustrating a spectrum rather than a binary. At its core, this concept hinges on the understanding that abundance, whether of goods, services, or information, inherently creates value. However, it's the relative scarcity within this abundance that allows for the capture of value. Absolute scarcity, on the other hand, leads to value destruction, epitomized by the detrimental effects of extreme rent-seeking or regulatory capture which stifles innovation and economic growth.

This idea is not just theoretical; it has practical implications across industries and geographies. Consider the contrast between the immense operations of pastry factories dotting the suburbs of London and Paris and the premium presentation of their delicacies in city centers. Or the sushi chain in London facing the unique challenge of preparing food on-premises due to real estate constraints, highlighting a discontinuity in geography and context. These examples reveal the nuanced interplay between creating and capturing value, where the location, skill level, and market dynamics significantly influence the process.

Understanding this spectrum of value creation and capture can guide strategies for innovation, competition, and regulation. For businesses, it suggests a focus on leveraging abundance while navigating or creating scarcities that do not tip into harmful exclusivity. For policymakers, it underscores the importance of fostering environments that encourage value creation and equitable value capture, avoiding regulatory frameworks that inadvertently promote absolute scarcity. Recognizing that we operate within this spectrum allows for a more nuanced approach to economic development, one that encourages the flourishing of both entrepreneurs and consumers in a balanced ecosystem.

Try again, without trying to capture all of the nuance in the notes. Instead, just look for the sweeping themes.

### Assistant - 2024-04-10 13:09:12

Imagine a scene where a savvy businesswoman in a smoke-filled room full of salespeople effortlessly juggles various designer brands, maximizing every inch of fabric to its fullest potential. This epitomizes the essence of value creation in a modern economy, a vivid illustration of how abundance breeds value. Yet, it is the careful curation and selective scarcity amidst this abundance that allows businesses to capture that value. This dynamic interplay between creation and capture forms a spectrum rather than a simple binary, challenging conventional wisdom on economic value.

At the heart of this discussion is the recognition that abundance, by its very nature, fosters an environment ripe for innovation and growth. The internet, with its endless reservoirs of information, exemplifies this principle perfectly. Yet, it is through mechanisms of relative scarcity—like the selective filtering of a search engine—that significant value is captured. In stark contrast, absolute scarcity, often manifested through rent-seeking behaviors or excessive regulation, does more harm than good, suffocating the potential for value creation and capture alike.

The implications of understanding this spectrum are profound. For businesses, it suggests a delicate balance between creating value through abundance and capturing value through strategic scarcity. For policymakers, it highlights the necessity of fostering an ecosystem that encourages innovation while preventing the destructive forces of absolute scarcity. By embracing this nuanced perspective, we stand to unlock a more vibrant, equitable, and sustainable economic future.

Now suggest 3 other ideas for the opening example. Focus on ideas where the creation and capture of value are super obvious

### Assistant - 2024-04-10 13:10:42

1. **The Rise of Open Source Software**: Imagine the bustling digital landscape where developers from around the world contribute to open source projects like Linux or Apache. Here, the creation of value is palpable, with thousands of individuals and companies contributing code, documentation, and support, fostering an abundance of resources and innovation. The capture of value becomes evident as tech giants and startups alike leverage these open-source foundations to build commercial products and services, charging for added functionalities, support, or associated hardware. This ecosystem thrives on the balance between communal innovation and individual enterprise, showcasing a clear delineation between value creation and capture.

2. **The Transformation of Coffee from Bean to Boutique**: Picture a coffee bean's journey from an Ethiopian farm to a high-end café in New York City. The farmer's cultivation and harvesting of coffee beans create intrinsic value through abundance. However, the true capture of value occurs further down the supply chain—roasters experimenting with roasting profiles to enhance flavors, and boutique cafés creating an experience around coffee, charging premium prices for specialty brews. Each step adds layers of value, culminating in a product far removed and more valuable than its humble origins, illustrating the transition from raw abundance to refined scarcity.

3. **The Evolution of Content on Streaming Platforms**: Visualize the vast libraries of films, TV shows, and documentaries available on streaming platforms like Netflix or Hulu. The value creation is evident in the sheer volume of content made accessible to millions worldwide, breaking down the traditional barriers of time and geography. The capture of value, however, is meticulously engineered through proprietary algorithms that curate personalized viewing recommendations, exclusive original content, and tiered subscription models. This strategy of creating an abundance of content while capturing value through personalization and exclusivity offers a clear-cut example of the principles at play.

Define value creation, value capture, and rent seeking

### Assistant - 2024-04-10 13:30:29

**Value Creation** refers to the process by which goods, services, or ideas are developed or improved upon to increase their worth or utility to consumers. This process involves innovation, efficiency improvements, the development of new technologies, or the enhancement of customer experience. Value creation is fundamental to economic growth and competitiveness, as it not only benefits the entity that develops these improvements but also adds to the overall wealth or utility available in the economy. For example, a tech company that develops a new, more efficient way to store data creates value by providing customers with a better product and potentially driving down costs.

**Value Capture** is the mechanism by which companies or individuals retain a portion of the value provided in the economy. This can be achieved through strategic pricing, maintaining control over unique resources, creating barriers to entry, or through branding and marketing strategies that allow them to charge premium prices. Value capture is critical for the sustainability of a business, as it enables them to earn a return on their investment in value creation. For instance, a pharmaceutical company that patents a new medication captures value by being the sole provider of that drug for a period, allowing it to set prices that reflect the value of the innovation to consumers.

**Rent-Seeking** is an economic concept that describes the practice of gaining additional income without contributing any corresponding productivity to the economy. It often involves exploiting a monopolistic or oligopolistic position to increase one's share of existing wealth without creating new wealth. Rent-seeking behaviors can include lobbying for regulatory barriers, exclusive contracts, or subsidies that limit competition and protect existing advantages. Unlike value creation, which contributes positively to economic welfare, rent-seeking typically represents a transfer of wealth from one group to another without any net gain in economic value. For example, a company that lobbies for government regulations that unfairly limit its competition's ability to operate is engaged in rent-seeking, as it seeks to increase its profits not by improving its own products or services, but by restricting the market.

What is the economic term for when something creates value for one person but has downstream negative effects for others, such as a factory creating air pollution

### Assistant - 2024-04-10 13:34:27

The economic term for when something creates value for one person or group but has downstream negative effects for others is **"externalities"**. Externalities can be positive or negative, depending on the impact. In the example you provided, where a factory creates air pollution, this would be considered a **negative externality**. Negative externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good or service imposes costs on third parties not involved in the transaction, which are not reflected in the market prices. This discrepancy can lead to market failure, where resources are not allocated efficiently or equitably. To address negative externalities, governments often intervene through regulations, taxes, or subsidies to encourage producers to reduce their harmful impacts.

Suggest improvements to this to make it more tight and compelling: 
There is so much entertainment content these days. So much great entertainment content. Whether shows, movies, books, music, art, or your media of choice, never before has the volume of value creation in entertainment been as vast as it is today. Yet that very volume of content makes it hard to figure what to consume and has led to the rise of aggregators who help users navigate this space. On the flipside, this era of abundance has made it a really hard time to be a creator. A creator may be reaching a larger audience than ever through aggregators but have less control and get less compensation than similar creators in the past who had a more direct relationship with their audience. 

Here we see the dynamic and nuanced interplay of value creation and value capture. Value creation occurs when someone creates something that is of value to someone. (There are important nuances here, like the creation of negative externalities, that can be put aside for the moment.) Value capture is the idea that someone turns some of this value into profit. 

Although sometimes portrayed as opposites, value creation and value capture are complementary activities. In the entertainment media example, both the creator and the aggregator create value, in different ways. The creator gets direct credit for the media. The aggregator creates value through having the right suggestion at the right time. Both deserve to profit from the value they create. Despite this, it’s hard to avoid feeling like these two types of value creation are different, that somehow the aggregator is profiting at the expense of the creator. (And let’s not forget that this tension is not due. Publishers and labels have long been accused of profiting from a similar dynamic.)

Is this mismatched intuition merely due to our intuition still catching up with the dynamics of abundance? To some degree. However, there’s also a kingmaker dynamic at play. Abundance creates value but makes it hard for anyone, the creators included, to capture that value. Value is captured by bringing back a sense of relative scarcity… and that requires making choices about what to include and what to exclude. Aggregators, for better and for worse, profit directly from the fact that they create relative scarcity out of abundance. So although they play a vital role, if they become dominant gatekeepers, an aggregator will start to be seen as capturing an unfair amount of value.

To get at this tension a bit more, it’s worth looking at the extremes of value capture. At one extreme, all profit goes to the people who created the thing itself. However, this often puts a cap on the amount of value that can be captured, leading people to “sell out” to increase their reach, at the expense of both their control over the type of value they create and their ability to capture all of that value. 

At the other extreme, value capture can become rent-seeking, where the entity capturing value plays no role in the creation of the value they are capturing profit from. Pay-to-play fees can feel like this, as can literal rent if it feels like the property owner is charging exorbitant prices. Rent-seeking often is correlated with absolute scarcity: only a limited amount of a resource exists or is allowed to be created, leading people who have access to that resource being able to extract increasing profit from it without creating additional value. 

The value creating mechanism of relative scarcity caused by selection from abundance, which can help capture value for both the creator and the aggregator, can easily become the value destroying mechanism of absolute scarcity if the aggregator mixes up their role of selection with that of gatekeeping. 

Understanding the interplay of value creation and value capture in an environment of abundance can guide us in fostering ecosystems. We can recognize that abundance creates huge amounts of value but also creates the need for additional mechanisms to help capture that value, which can create a business opportunity. But capitalizing on that opportunity requires giving up some amount of control because both the creators and the consumers of the abundance that create that opportunity are very sensitive to the distinction between aggregators as guides and aggregators as gatekeepers.

In today's world, we're inundated with entertainment content. From shows and movies to books and music, the wealth of creative output is unprecedented. This surge in content creation has led to the rise of aggregators, platforms designed to help us navigate this sea of choices. However, this abundance poses unique challenges for creators. Despite reaching wider audiences through these platforms, they often find themselves with less control and diminished compensation compared to their predecessors who had a more direct connection with their audience.

This scenario highlights the intricate dance between value creation and value capture. Value creation is the act of producing something valuable, a concept straightforward in isolation but complex when considering the broader economic implications, like the creation of negative externalities. Value capture, on the other hand, is about converting this created value into profit.

While often seen as distinct, value creation and value capture are inherently linked. In the entertainment industry, creators and aggregators both add value in different ways. Creators provide the original content, while aggregators offer the service of making the right recommendation at the right time. Both roles are deserving of profit, yet there's an underlying tension, particularly as aggregators may seem to profit at the creators' expense—a dynamic not unique to the digital age but amplified by it.

This tension might stem from the "kingmaker" dynamic prevalent in today's market. The vastness of content requires a filter, creating a relative scarcity that allows value to be captured. Aggregators thrive by making these selections, but if they become too dominant, they risk being perceived as unfair gatekeepers, hoarding value without corresponding contributions to its creation.

At one end of the spectrum, value capture rewards the creators directly, but this can limit overall value captured, pushing some to compromise for broader reach. At the other, it verges on rent-seeking, where profits are made without adding new value, often exploiting artificial scarcity.

The key lies in balancing the ecosystem. Recognizing that abundance creates significant value but also necessitates mechanisms for value capture is crucial. This understanding can pave the way for business opportunities that respect the delicate balance between guiding consumers and gatekeeping creators. By navigating this landscape thoughtfully, we can foster an environment where both creators and aggregators can thrive without compromising the integrity of the value they contribute to.

We're inundated with entertainment content. From shows and movies to books and music, the wealth of creative output is unprecedented. This surge in content creation has led to the rise of aggregators, platforms designed to help us navigate this sea of choices. However, this abundance poses unique challenges for creators. Despite reaching wider audiences through these platforms, creators often find themselves with less control and diminished compensation compared to earlier artists who had a more direct connection with their audience.

Here we see the dynamic and nuanced interplay of value creation and value capture. Value creation occurs when someone produces something valuable (a concept straightforward on its own, but more nuanced when you consider negative externalities). Value capture occurs when someone, not necessarily the creator, turns some of this value into profit. 

Value creation and value capture are complementary activities. In entertainment, for example, creators and aggregators add value in different ways. Creators provide content. Aggregators make the right suggestion at the right time. Creators are able to capture value more easily because aggregators add a value capture channel both can profit from. Yet there’s an underlying tension: aggregators can seem to profit at the expense of creators. (This tension is not new. Publishers and labels have long been accused of profiting from a similar dynamic.)

Is this tension merely due to our intuition catching up with the dynamics of abundance? To some degree, yes. However, we are also sensitive to the kingmaker dynamic at play.

So although they play a vital role, if they become dominant gatekeepers, an aggregator will start to be seen as capturing an unfair amount of value.

We can look at value capture as a spectrum. At one end, creators are rewarded directly but often only within a limited market. They get 100% of a smaller pie. At the other end of the spectrum, value creation becomes rent-seeking, where profits are made without adding new value, often by creating or exploiting absolute scarcity. 

The key lies in balancing the ecosystem. We can recognize that abundance creates significant value but also necessitates mechanisms for value capture. This understanding can pave the way for business opportunities that respect the delicate balance that keeps guiding consumers from becoming gatekeeping creators. By seeing aggregation and abundance as a problem of nurturing ecosystems, we can foster an environment where both creators and aggregators can thrive.
