### Assistant - 2023-04-28 08:01:47

Carole Pateman is a prominent feminist political theorist and professor known for her work on democratic theory, citizenship, and gender inequality. While her work spans a wide range of topics, some of her key ideas include:

1. Sexual contract theory: In her influential work, "The Sexual Contract" (1988), Pateman critiques traditional social contract theories for their androcentric focus. She argues that the "original" social contract is, in fact, a sexual contract in which men established dominance over women. This contract enforces patriarchy by excluding women from political life and treating them as subjects rather than equal participants in the social contract.

2. Critique of the public/private divide: Pateman challenges the notion that public and private spheres are distinct and separate entities, arguing that this division serves to maintain and legitimize gender inequality. She emphasizes that the dichotomy is a social construct that allows for the perpetuation of patriarchal norms and structures.

3. Participatory democracy: Pateman is an advocate for participatory democracy, a political system that emphasizes the direct involvement of citizens in the decision-making process. She argues that this approach fosters political engagement, empowerment, and a more egalitarian society.

4. Concept of self-ownership: In her work on self-ownership, Pateman critiques the liberal concept of individual property rights over oneself, arguing that it perpetuates a patriarchal social order. She asserts that self-ownership is an inherently gendered concept that has been used to justify women's subordination.

5. Feminist critiques of wage labor: Pateman critiques the institution of wage labor, arguing that it reinforces patriarchal norms and gendered power relations. She posits that the wage labor system is built upon the subordination of women and that it contributes to their continued marginalization in the workforce.

6. Citizenship: Pateman's work also explores the concept of citizenship and its relationship to gender. She argues that the traditional conception of citizenship is inherently exclusionary, as it has been historically limited to propertied white men. Pateman advocates for a more inclusive definition of citizenship that recognizes and addresses gender-based inequalities.
