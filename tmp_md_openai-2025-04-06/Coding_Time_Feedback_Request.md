This is a casual message being sent to a small (50 person) engineering team. Assume the team knows what a Cody engagement survey is. Give feedback on this message

:keyboard-shark: It's time to talk about your coding time! :keyboard-shark: 

Through some of the internal Cody engagement surveys, I've heard feedback that one of the reasons that people aren't using Cody more is that they feel they don't feel they have enough time to code. Whether or not you use Cody, not having enough time to code is a problem I'd like to have more insight into.

So now that we're through the release and planning, I'd love to get some informal feedback on how you're feeling about coding time. So let's emoji vote! 

:thumbsup::skin-tone-3: I'm feeling good about my coding time these days
:chart_with_upwards_trend: I'm not where I'd like to be, but things are trending the right direction
:shrug::skin-tone-3: I'm not where I'd like to be, and I don't see that changing
:thumbsdown::skin-tone-3: I am not happy with the amount of time I have to spend coding

I'd also love to hear comments on what would help people move in the direction of feeling satisfied with their coding time.

Your message is clear and friendly, and you're using emojis in a light-hearted way to engage the team. However, there are some tweaks that could improve clarity and professionalism. Here's a revised version of your message:

---

:keyboard: **Let's Discuss Your Coding Time!** :keyboard:

From our recent Cody engagement surveys, it seems that a lack of coding time might be a reason some of you aren't using Cody as much. Regardless of Cody usage, understanding and addressing this concern is important to me.

Now that we've wrapped up our release and planning, I'd appreciate your feedback on this matter. Let's use emoji voting to make it fun!

:thumbsup::skin-tone-3: I feel good about my current coding time.
:chart_with_upwards_trend: I'd like more, but I'm optimistic about the future.
:shrug::skin-tone-3: I'm not satisfied, and I don't see that changing soon.
:thumbsdown::skin-tone-3: I'm unhappy with the amount of time I have for coding.

Beyond emojis, please share any specific thoughts or suggestions that might help us improve in this area. Your feedback is invaluable!

:keyboard: **Let's Discuss Your Coding Time!** :keyboard:

Through our Cody engagement surveys, I've learned that some of you feel pressed for coding time. Regardless of Cody usage, it's crucial for me to address this.
