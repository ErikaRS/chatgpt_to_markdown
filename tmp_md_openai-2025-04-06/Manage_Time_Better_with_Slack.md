My biggest time-waster during the day is checking Slack messages. To help me manage my time better, suggest which items I eliminate from my schedule. For the rest, tell me how I delegate them or reduce these distractions.

Certainly! Here are some suggestions for managing your time more effectively with respect to Slack messages:

1. **Frequent Checking**:
   - **Eliminate**: Constantly checking Slack for new messages.
   - **Delegate/Reduce**: Set specific times in the day (e.g., once in the morning, once after lunch, and once before wrapping up) to check and respond to Slack messages. Outside of these times, mute notifications or close the app.

2. **Unnecessary Channels**:
   - **Eliminate**: Being a member of channels that aren't directly related to your role or project.
   - **Delegate/Reduce**: Review your channel list and leave those that aren't essential. For larger teams or organizations, consider appointing a channel "gatekeeper" who can update you weekly on important takeaways from channels you've left.

3. **Lengthy Discussions**:
   - **Eliminate**: Lengthy back-and-forths on Slack which can be resolved more effectively via other means.
   - **Delegate/Reduce**: If a discussion isn't reaching a resolution quickly, suggest switching to a quick phone call, video meeting, or face-to-face chat (if applicable).

4. **Repetitive Queries**:
   - **Eliminate**: Answering the same questions or addressing the same topics multiple times.
   - **Delegate/Reduce**: Create a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document or pin important messages in channels. Direct team members to these resources.

5. **Over-reliance on Slack**:
   - **Eliminate**: Using Slack for tasks it's not optimized for, like task management or long-form content.
   - **Delegate/Reduce**: Use appropriate tools like Trello, Asana, or Google Docs for such tasks, and use Slack to notify team members of updates to these tools.

6. **General Notifications**:
   - **Eliminate**: Non-essential notifications that aren't directly addressed to you.
   - **Delegate/Reduce**: Customize your Slack notification settings to only receive direct messages, mentions, and keywords important to you. Encourage your team to use mentions (@) judiciously.

7. **Multitasking**:
   - **Eliminate**: Trying to work on tasks while simultaneously participating in active Slack channels.
   - **Delegate/Reduce**: When working on focused tasks, set your Slack status to "Do Not Disturb" or mute notifications temporarily.

8. **Status Updates**:
   - **Eliminate**: Frequent status updates that can be automated.
   - **Delegate/Reduce**: Use bots or integrations that automatically update team members on the progress of certain tasks or projects.

Lastly, consider conducting a workshop or training session for your team on best practices for Slack usage. This way, everyone is on the same page about efficient communication and minimizing distractions.

I am a very busy person newly promoted to the executive team as head of engineering. We need to figure out how to rebuild trust after layoffs, come up with a product roadmap that can be implemented, redefine the career ladder so expectations are clear any performance reviews are not surprising, and deal with administrative tasks like setting up new meetings and slack channels. Tomorrow I have a mostly meeting free day. How could I prioritize my free day to be most effective?

**Morning (Focus on Strategy and Team Morale)**

2. **Rebuilding Trust After Layoffs (1.5 hours)**:

   - Consider setting up open forums or feedback sessions where team members can share their concerns.

3. **Product Roadmap (1 hour)**:

   - List down key product features or enhancements needed in the upcoming quarters. This will be a high-level list that you can later discuss in-depth with product managers and leads.

**Midday (Focus on Operational Efficiency)**

4. **Redefining the Career Ladder (1.5 hours)**:
   - Review the current career ladder and understand its gaps.
   - Begin drafting a clearer, more defined career path for your engineers. Focus on clear expectations for each role, required competencies, and potential growth paths.

5. **Administrative Tasks (1 hour)**:

**Afternoon (Focus on Implementation and Communication)**

6. **Performance Review Structure (1 hour)**:
   - Draft a new review structure that aligns with the redefined career ladder.
   - Ensure the review process focuses on clear expectations, continuous feedback, and objective evaluations.

7. **Meeting with Direct Reports (1 hour)**:
   - If possible, have a quick sync-up with your direct reports. This will help in getting feedback on your drafted plans and understanding any immediate concerns they might have.
   
8. **Preparation for Future Discussions (1 hour)**:
   - Prepare notes, slides, or documents for any upcoming meetings where you need to present your drafts. This includes town halls, executive meetings, or team meetings.

   - Make a list of follow-ups or action items that need attention in the coming days.

Remember, while this schedule is packed, ensure you take short breaks to clear your mind. It's essential to maintain clarity and focus. If you can't complete everything, prioritize and shift tasks as needed. The key is to make significant progress and set the stage for future detailed discussions and implementations.
