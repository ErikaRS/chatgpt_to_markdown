Yes, there are several terms that describe engineering roles which may involve both implementation and some level of software development. Here are a few commonly used titles:

1. **Systems Engineer** - This role often involves implementing complex systems that include software components, and may require some software development to integrate various subsystems.

2. **Solutions Engineer** - Solutions Engineers work closely with customers to design and implement software solutions. This role typically involves a mix of technical consulting, system configuration, and sometimes custom software development.

3. **DevOps Engineer** - DevOps Engineers focus on the deployment and management of software systems. They often write scripts or develop software tools to automate deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure management.

4. **Application Engineer** - This role typically involves customizing and implementing software applications to meet business needs. It may require modifying existing software or developing new functionalities.

5. **Technical Consultant** - Technical consultants work on implementing software solutions and may also write code to customize or integrate different software products.

6. **Integration Engineer** - As the name suggests, Integration Engineers focus on integrating various software systems and components. This role may involve developing middleware, APIs, or scripts that help different systems work together efficiently.

Each of these roles might involve varying degrees of software development, depending on the specific job description and the needs of the employer.

An **Implementation Engineer** is responsible for the deployment and configuration of complex systems, often involving both hardware and software components. Their primary role is to translate the solution designs created by architects or developers into fully functioning systems within a client or organizationâ€™s operational environment.

The work of an Implementation Engineer typically involves several key activities:

1. **Installation**: Physically setting up hardware and installing software applications as per the specifications.
   
2. **Configuration**: Adjusting software settings and options to match the requirements of the business or client. This could include setting up user accounts, configuring network connections, and customizing software to integrate with existing systems.

3. **Testing**: Running tests to ensure the system functions correctly and meets the predefined performance criteria. This may include troubleshooting any issues that arise during the setup process.

4. **Documentation**: Providing detailed documentation on the setup procedures, configurations, and any changes made during the installation process. This documentation is crucial for future maintenance and troubleshooting.

5. **Training and Support**: Offering training sessions to end-users and other stakeholders, ensuring they understand how to use the new systems effectively. Additionally, they provide ongoing support to address any issues or further refinements needed after the implementation phase.

Implementation Engineers must have a solid technical background in the systems they are deploying, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders. This role requires a blend of technical expertise in IT systems, a practical approach to problem-solving, and project management skills to ensure implementations are completed on time and within budget.
