Which is worse for your hair: blow drying or air drying and then styling with a heated brush / straightener?

Both blow drying and air drying followed by styling with a heated tool can cause damage to your hair, but the extent of the damage depends on how each method is performed.

1. **Blow Drying:**
   - Blow drying can be harmful if done frequently, especially at high heat settings. The heat can strip moisture from the hair, leading to dryness, brittleness, and split ends. However, blow drying on a low or medium heat setting with proper heat protection can minimize damage.

2. **Air Drying Followed by Styling with a Heated Brush/Straightener:**
   - Air drying is generally less damaging because it doesn't expose your hair to direct heat, allowing it to retain more moisture. However, when you then use a heated brush or straightener, the concentrated heat can cause significant damage, particularly if the tool is set to a high temperature or if it's used on hair that still has some moisture, which can cause "bubble hair" (tiny bubbles form within the hair shaft, making it weaker).

**Which is Worse?**
- **Heated Styling Tools:** Using a straightener or heated brush after air drying is generally more damaging than blow drying alone, especially if the tool is used at a high temperature or too frequently. The direct and intense heat of these tools can cause more severe damage than the diffuse heat from a blow dryer.

To minimize damage, consider:
- Using heat protection products before applying any heat.
- Keeping heat tools on a lower setting.
- Limiting the frequency of heat styling.
- Allowing hair to air dry partially before finishing with a blow dryer on a cool or low setting.

What's the fastest way to dry hair with minimal damage?

The fastest way to dry hair with minimal damage involves a combination of gentle techniques and using the right products and tools. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Gently Towel Dry**
   - **Blot, Don’t Rub:** After washing your hair, gently blot it with a microfiber towel or a soft t-shirt to remove excess water. Avoid rubbing, as this can cause friction, leading to frizz and breakage.

### 2. **Use a Leave-In Conditioner or Heat Protectant**
   - **Apply a Leave-In Conditioner:** This helps to detangle your hair and adds a layer of protection. Look for products that also offer heat protection if you plan to use a blow dryer.
   - **Heat Protectant Spray:** Before blow drying, apply a heat protectant spray to shield your hair from heat damage.

### 3. **Use a Blow Dryer with a Nozzle Attachment**
   - **Set to Low or Medium Heat:** Start by blow drying on the lowest heat setting that will still dry your hair efficiently. Use the cool setting to finish drying and seal the hair cuticle, reducing frizz.
   - **Use a Nozzle:** Attach a concentrator nozzle to the blow dryer to direct the airflow down the hair shaft. This helps to smooth the cuticle and minimize damage.

### 4. **Dry in Sections**
   - **Section Your Hair:** Divide your hair into sections, drying one section at a time. This allows for more controlled drying, which reduces the amount of time and heat exposure needed.

### 5. **Finish with Cool Air**
   - **Cool Shot:** Once your hair is mostly dry, use the cool shot button on your blow dryer or switch to the cool setting. This helps to close the hair cuticle, locking in moisture and adding shine.

### Additional Tips:
   - **Don’t Blow Dry Soaking Wet Hair:** Let your hair air dry or towel dry until it’s about 60-70% dry before using the blow dryer. This reduces the amount of time your hair is exposed to heat.
   - **Avoid Overdrying:** Stop blow drying when your hair is just dry. Overdrying can strip moisture from the hair, leading to damage.

By combining these techniques, you can dry your hair quickly while minimizing heat exposure and reducing the risk of damage.
