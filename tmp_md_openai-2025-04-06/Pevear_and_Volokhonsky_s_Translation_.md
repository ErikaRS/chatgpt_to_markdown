As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but there are several translations of Anna Karenina, and the best one can depend on various factors such as the reader's preferences, the context, and the purpose of the reading. 

That being said, many readers and scholars consider the translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky to be one of the best. Their translation was published in 2000 and has received critical acclaim for its fidelity to the original Russian text, clarity, and readability. 

Other well-regarded translations include those by Constance Garnett, Rosemary Edmonds, and Louise and Aylmer Maude. Ultimately, the best translation for you may depend on your individual tastes and preferences, so it may be worth sampling different translations to find the one that resonates most with you.
