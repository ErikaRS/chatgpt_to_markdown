Write a flux style essay from the following very rough. Aim for something that explores and interesting idea but is fairly concise. The goal isn't to integrate all the notes. It's to create a coherent piece inspired by the notes. Remove references to specific names. We want a singular integrated piece. 

Overall theme: We've been thinking of AI as tools that raise the floor for people with less expertise in a domain. But it can also be a ceiling raiser. 

We're starting to see hints of this with Claude Code and Claude 3.7 Sonnet which has been powerful for writing code but still requires skill using the tool.

Tools that raise the floor improve groups who aren't experts in the tool's domain vs tools that raise the ceiling improve experts in the domain 

Julta: floor/ceiling raising as a lens for leadership

Spencer: There is something generative about the idea that practice/use of tool ≠ what you can make with it

Hammering a nail ≠ building cabinet

Spencer:Or more like being able to hammer a nail doesn't mean you can build a cabinet. You also need

other connected skills
commitment
a creative idea or maybe a problem you're interested in solving

Stefano: It's like going into a workshop and yelling tell me a table. [it = not engaging in dialog with tools]

Julka: We have relationships with our tools.

E: Expertise is always valued but what change over time is what that expertise is in. 

E: Interesting challenge right now is that what that expertise will be in shifting. There was a period where we thought it was prompting and while good prompting skills are important, things are still changing so fast that what it means to be good at prompting still change frequently. Its probably higher level skills like thinking about how to break down problems, define acceptance criteria, evaluate results.

### Raising the Floor, Raising the Ceiling  

For much of the AI revolution, the dominant metaphor has been that of the floor rising. AI as an equalizer, giving more people access to capabilities once reserved for experts. If you can describe a problem well enough, the thinking goes, AI can generate a competent solution—whether it’s writing, coding, or design. But there's another, less discussed shift underway: AI as a ceiling-raiser. Not just making the floor accessible but expanding what’s possible at the highest levels of skill.  

The distinction matters. A tool that raises the floor allows more people to participate, making tasks easier or more intuitive. A tool that raises the ceiling pushes the limits of what experts can do, amplifying skill rather than replacing it. We’re starting to see hints of this in AI-assisted coding, where models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet are powerful but still require expertise to wield effectively. Writing great code with AI isn’t just about prompting well; it’s about understanding structure, debugging logic, and defining success criteria. The tool doesn’t replace the craft—it extends it.  

A useful analogy: Being able to hammer a nail doesn’t mean you can build a cabinet. You need other skills—an understanding of materials, an eye for design, a sense of what makes a good table versus a bad one. AI raises the floor by handing out hammers. But in the hands of a master, it can also refine the craft, helping experts build what was previously impossible.  

This shift has implications beyond coding. Leadership, for example, is often thought of as a floor-raising function: making sure the team is equipped, the barriers are lowered, the system works. But great leaders don’t just clear obstacles—they push the ceiling higher, challenging their teams to think differently, to engage with new tools in ways that expand what’s possible. AI, used well, can play that role too.  

The challenge is that expertise itself is shifting. For a moment, it seemed like prompting—crafting clever inputs for AI—might be the new expertise. But that’s already evolving. The higher-order skills remain: breaking down problems, setting clear criteria for success, evaluating results critically. The real opportunity isn’t in mastering any single tool, but in learning how to work with tools in a deeper, more intentional way.  

Because at the end of the day, you can’t just walk into a workshop and yell, “Tell me a table.” It’s not about issuing commands but about having a conversation with the tool, shaping its output, refining the vision. AI may help raise the floor for many, but for those willing to engage at a higher level, it’s an invitation to raise the ceiling as well.

suggest some more fluxy titles, titles which are not merely descriptive but which have a spark of creativity or whimsy

Here are some more *FLUX*-style titles that add a bit of playfulness, depth, or curiosity:  

- **"Mind the Ceiling"**  
- **"AI and the Art of Cabinetmaking"**  
- **"Hammers for Everyone, Cabinets for the Bold"**  
- **"When the Floor Rises, Do We Forget to Look Up?"**  
- **"You Can’t Just Yell 'Table!'"**  
- **"The Workshop Talks Back"**  
- **"A Higher Ceiling Requires a Stronger Ladder"**  
- **"What to Do With All These Hammers?"**  
- **"Beyond the Prompt"**  
- **"Tools Don't Build, People Do"**  

Each of these aims to capture the central theme while adding a bit of intrigue, metaphor, or humor. Let me know if any resonate or if you’d like more!

Here's the updated vrsion of the piece. Suggest some fluxy titles for this version

One of the dominant metaphors around AI so far has been that of raising the floor. AI acts as an equalizer — at least on the lower end — giving more people access to knowledge and capabilities once reserved for experts. If you can describe a problem well enough, AI can generate a competent solution — at least in domains like writing, coding, and design. A tool that raises the floor allows more people to participate. It makes tasks easier or more intuitive and helps with navigating through unfamiliar domains (just be wary of Gell-Mann amnesia).
But there's another shift underway, one that felt out of reach even a year ago: AI as a ceiling-raiser, expanding what’s possible at the highest levels of skill. A tool that raises the ceiling pushes the limits of what experts can do, amplifying skill rather than replacing it. We’re starting to see hints of this in AI-assisted coding, where tools like Claude Code using models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet are opening powerful new possibilities. They require expertise to wield effectively, but they can make even experts more effective. 

In this world, the nature of expertise changes. To stick with the example of code, writing great code will no longer be about knowing the ins and out of libraries and language. But neither is writing great code with AI just about prompting well. It’s about understanding how to break down problems, define success criteria, and critically evaluate the results. The tool doesn’t replace the craft—it shifts it. Especially with the constant change in model capabilities, the opportunity isn’t in mastering any single tool, but in learning how to work with tools in a deeper, more intentional way.
AI is not novel in this respect. Leadership, for example, can be treated as floor-raising: making sure the team is equipped, the barriers are lowered, the system works. But great leaders push the ceiling higher, challenging their teams to think differently, to engage with new tools in ways that expand what’s possible. 
Even equipped with an army of agents, we can’t just turn on the computer and tell “Build me a video game!” We have to think through what we want out of it at the end of the day. It’s not about issuing commands but about having a conversation with the tool, shaping its output, refining the vision. AI helps raise the floor for many, but for those willing to engage at a higher level, it’s an invitation to raise the ceiling as well.

Here are some *FLUX*-style title ideas that capture the spirit of the revised piece:  

- **"Raising the Floor, Raising the Stakes"**  
- **"You Can’t Just Say ‘Build Me a Video Game’"**  
- **"The Ceiling is a Ladder"**  
- **"More Than a Prompt"**  
- **"Hammers, Cabinets, and the Future of Expertise"**  
- **"Tools Don’t Replace the Craft—They Shift It"**  
- **"Mind the Ceiling (It’s Moving)"**  
- **"The Floor is Rising. Are We Looking Up?"**
