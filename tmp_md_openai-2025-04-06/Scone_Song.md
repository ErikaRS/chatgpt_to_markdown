Write a song about eating scones to the tune of Mony Mony. It should include the lines "I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony"

(Verse 1)
Wake up in the morning with a sweet tooth,
Grab a scone, it's the only thing to do,
Fresh out the oven, oh it's so divine,
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony, all the time!

(Chorus)
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony,
Oh, oh, oh, it's like a symphony,
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony,
Come on, come on, join me in this bakery!

(Verse 2)
Strawberry jam and clotted cream,
The perfect combo, a scone lover's dream,
Buttery and flaky, melt in your mouth,
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony, without a doubt!

(Chorus)
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony,
Oh, oh, oh, it's like a symphony,
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony,
Come on, come on, join me in this bakery!

(Bridge)
Take a bite, oh it's pure delight,
Can't get enough, I'll eat them day and night,
Chocolate chip or blueberry, any kind will do,
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony, how 'bout you?

(Verse 3)
Friends all gathered, it's afternoon tea,
Scones on the table, it's a sight to see,
Sweet or savory, we can't go wrong,
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony, all day long!

(Chorus)
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony,
Oh, oh, oh, it's like a symphony,
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony,
Come on, come on, join me in this bakery!

(Outro)
Now we've tasted heaven, it's hard to say goodbye,
But scones will always be there, just waiting to satisfy,
We'll be back tomorrow, oh you can bet,
I want to eat a scony, eat a scony, eat a scony, no regrets!

Try again. Ignore what I said before. Write a song about eating scones that is a variation on Mony Mony called Scony Scony

(Verse 1)
Woke up this morning, feeling fine,
Looking for something, to blow my mind,
Oh, I found it, can't you see?
Scony, Scony, you're the one for me!

(Chorus)
Scony, Scony, oh you're so fine,
Scony, Scony, can't get you off my mind,
Scony, Scony, let's have some tea,
Scony, Scony, you're the one for me!

(Verse 2)
Freshly baked, straight from the oven,
Golden brown, oh I'm in love, and
Topped with jam and cream so sweet,
Scony, Scony, you're my favorite treat!

(Chorus)
Scony, Scony, oh you're so fine,
Scony, Scony, can't get you off my mind,
Scony, Scony, let's have some tea,
Scony, Scony, you're the one for me!

(Bridge)
I've tried them all, the pastries so sweet,
But nothing compares to this scone, so neat,
Flaky, tender, the taste's divine,
Scony, Scony, oh you're one of a kind!

(Verse 3)
Gather 'round friends, it's time for tea,
There's one thing we all can agree,
Scones are the best, there's no debate,
Scony, Scony, our love won't abate!

(Chorus)
Scony, Scony, oh you're so fine,
Scony, Scony, can't get you off my mind,
Scony, Scony, let's have some tea,
Scony, Scony, you're the one for me!

(Outro)
So let's raise a toast, to our favorite snack,
To the scone, we'll always come back,
In the bakery or at home,
Scony, Scony, you're the best we've known!

Do you actually know the song mony Mony? By billy idol 

### Assistant - 2023-04-29 07:54:14

Yes, I'm familiar with the song "Mony Mony." It was originally written and performed by Tommy James and the Shondells in 1968. However, it gained further popularity with Billy Idol's cover version in 1981, which was then re-released in 1987 as a live version. The song is known for its upbeat tempo, catchy chorus, and energetic vibe.
