Here are some very rough notes about a conversation about variety. Unpack some of the concepts here so that the ideas are more fit for a broader audience:
Variety can arise without input but requisite variety exists within a broader system. Limiting input limits the system as much as if the control is limited. Larger range of inputs can increase the variety. Input matters for requisite variety as much as the controller itself. Maybe even if evolves the controller. (Autocracy has a poverty of inputs observation from ar.)

(requisite variety is ashby's law of requisite variety)

Certainly! Here’s a clearer explanation of the concepts discussed in your notes:

### Understanding Variety and Requisite Variety

**Variety** refers to the range of different states or options available within a system. This concept is crucial in various fields, from cybernetics to management.

**Requisite Variety**, also known as Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety, states that for a system to effectively manage its environment, it must have a range of responses (variety) that matches the variety of inputs it receives. In simpler terms, a system can only control its environment if it has enough diversity in its responses to handle different situations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Variety without Input**:
    - A system can exhibit variety internally without any external input. For example, an organism may have various internal states or responses ready, regardless of external stimuli.

2. **Requisite Variety within a Broader System**:
    - For a system to maintain stability and control, it must operate within a larger environment or system that supports a necessary range of inputs and responses. The system’s variety must match or exceed the variety in its environment to effectively manage it.

3. **Impact of Limiting Input**:
    - Limiting the range of inputs to a system restricts its ability to adapt and respond effectively. This is akin to having fewer tools in a toolbox; the system is less capable of handling diverse situations, leading to potential failures in control and adaptation.

4. **Increasing Variety through Larger Range of Inputs**:
    - Introducing a broader range of inputs can enhance a system's variety. More diverse inputs provide more opportunities for the system to develop new responses and adapt to changing conditions. 

5. **Importance of Input and Controller**:
    - Both the inputs (external information or stimuli) and the controller (the mechanism within the system that processes inputs and generates responses) are crucial. Adequate and varied inputs are as important as having a sophisticated controller capable of managing those inputs.

6. **Evolution of the Controller**:
    - Over time, varied inputs can lead to the evolution and improvement of the controller. As the system encounters diverse situations, it learns and adapts, refining its responses and enhancing its ability to manage its environment.

7. **Autocracy and Poverty of Inputs**:
    - In autocratic systems, there is often a "poverty of inputs" because decision-making is centralized, and diverse perspectives are not considered. This lack of input variety can lead to poor adaptability and decision-making, as the system does not receive enough diverse information to effectively respond to complex situations.

### Summary

To effectively manage and adapt to its environment, a system needs a sufficient range of responses that match the variety of inputs it receives. Limiting these inputs restricts the system’s adaptability and control. Increasing the range of inputs can enhance the system's variety, leading to better responses and potential evolution of its controlling mechanisms. This principle is crucial in understanding the limitations of autocratic systems, which often suffer from a lack of diverse inputs, leading to poorer adaptability and control.

Here's a very rough draft essay. Maintaining the style and overall points, modify it to have a better flow and integrate the key points missing from the previous expansion. Add more brief but concrete examples where needed. Add a closing paragraph which concludes with an insightful, practical, hopeful takeaway message (but not one that's corny or sappy)

We often revisit the idea of requisite variety, the idea that to be able to control a system, the control system must have more variety — more available states — than the system that it is controlling. Without this, the control system will be unable to represent the states of the system it needs to control. Although variety and requisite variety seem like very similar concepts, there is one important difference: variety can arise without input, but requisite variety must exist within a larger system. Requisite variety requires that there be at least two elements: the system being controlled and the controller. 

Limiting the possible states of the controller is not the only way that control over a system can be limited. Another way to increase or decrease the control over a system is to control the input to that system. Although the theoretical variety of the system under control remains unchanged, a larger range of inputs can increase the practical variety that the system demonstrates. For example, a person cannot say they like or dislike a food they’ve never been exposed to (although they can make a guess based on its similarity to past food they’ve eaten). 

In a dynamic system, where the controller and the system under control are not static, input can evolve the controller itself. To continue our food example, the primary controller for most household’s cooking might be the grocery store. As the household’s input changes — maybe they get exposure to to tteokbokki for the first time — they will start adding new dishes to their menu. However, what they can make will be limited by what the grocery store sells. Over time, though, the same input which changed their taste will also influence what the grocery store carries. Inputs change the effective variety of both the controlled and controlling system. 

The idea that inputs limit the practical variety of a system also adds more reason to the reasons why autocracy is limiting. A system controlled by one person has limited variety (because one person can only have so much state). However, another way that autocracies often intentionally try to limit variety is by limiting access to information — controlling the inputs. This can be useful if the goal is to focus an organization on a very clear, focused set of goals, à la Steve Jobs and Apple. However, such intense focus is only beneficial in limited circumstances. In most systems, especially societies that encompass a mix of desires and choices, the dual limitations of autocracy become deeply problematic.

We often revisit the idea of requisite variety, which posits that to effectively control a system, the control mechanism must possess greater variety — more available states — than the system it seeks to manage. Without this, the controller cannot adequately represent the states of the system it needs to regulate. While variety and requisite variety seem similar, a crucial difference exists: variety can emerge without external input, but requisite variety must operate within a broader system. Requisite variety necessitates at least two elements: the system being controlled and the controller.

Limiting the possible states of the controller is not the only way to constrain control over a system. Another method is to regulate the input to that system. Although the theoretical variety of the system under control remains unchanged, a larger range of inputs can increase the practical variety that the system demonstrates. For instance, a person cannot say they like or dislike a food they’ve never been exposed to, although they can make a guess based on its similarity to past food they’ve eaten. Exposure to new foods, like trying tteokbokki for the first time, increases the practical variety of their diet and preferences.

In a dynamic system where the controller and the controlled system are not static, input can evolve the controller itself. Continuing with the food example, the primary controller for most households' cooking might be the grocery store. As the household’s input changes — for example, discovering tteokbokki — they may start incorporating new dishes into their menu. However, their cooking options will be limited by what the grocery store stocks. Over time, the same input that changed their taste may also influence what the grocery store carries. Inputs, therefore, change the effective variety of both the controlled and controlling systems.

This principle highlights why autocracy can be so limiting. A system controlled by one person has limited variety because one person can only hold so many states. Additionally, autocracies often intentionally limit variety by restricting access to information — controlling the inputs. While this can be beneficial for focusing an organization on clear, specific goals, as seen with Steve Jobs and Apple, such intense focus is advantageous only in limited circumstances. In most systems, particularly societies that encompass a mix of desires and choices, the dual limitations of autocracy become deeply problematic.

For example, a society governed autocratically might stifle innovation by limiting access to diverse perspectives and ideas. Conversely, a democratic society, with its broader range of inputs and collective decision-making, can adapt and evolve more effectively. This adaptability is crucial for addressing complex, multifaceted challenges, such as economic development or environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, the principle of requisite variety underscores the importance of maintaining diverse inputs and responses within any system. By embracing a wide range of inputs, we can enhance our ability to manage and adapt to various situations, fostering resilience and innovation. Whether in organizational management, household decisions, or societal governance, diversity in input and control mechanisms leads to more robust and adaptable systems. This insight encourages us to create environments that welcome diverse perspectives, driving progress and fostering a more resilient future.
