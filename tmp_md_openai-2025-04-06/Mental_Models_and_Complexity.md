Give this a more "FLUX-y" style

On Theory of Mind
Mentalization, or the theory of mind, is our capacity to see that other people have beliefs, emotions, thoughts, and desires. It’s an essential part of being a human. We rely on our ability to comprehend the intentions of others by imagining their mental states to conduct ourselves socially.

Mostly automatically, we create mental models of other people and use these models to make predictions based on their behavior. The maturity of a model defines the success or failure of our applied theory of mind.

If these models are like stick figures, then our predictions will be mostly wrong, causing us to flub social interactions, making various faux pas incessantly.

The more complex our models, the more successful we become at the theory of mind, making accurate predictions and acting on them in a way that helps us establish and develop relationships, and generally thrive in society.

So here it is, the secret to our success. Just build perfect models of all humans around us and rely on them – and the world’s our oyster.

The trick is that we humans are very complex. Like, really really complex. And creating a perfect mental model of even a single human with the faculties that we have is actually impossible, if we are to believe the Ashby’s law of requisite variety. Can’t build a model of a system inside of a system of equal (or lesser) complexity. 

So we have to contend with templates: a handful of mental models of others that we hold in our minds. When encountering other individuals, we apply our judgment to assign these templates to them.

One of these models is, of course, that of ourselves. Depending on our stage of adult development, this might be the most complex model we have.

Other models include people who we spend significant time with or who influenced us greatly. It could be our parents, siblings, or even coaches and teachers – or our bullies and tormentors.

This set of models more or less defines how well we will be able to function in society. If we were around a diverse set of functioning, well-rounded adults, we’d have enough variety to make reasonable predictions in a modern society. Unless, of course this society consists of vicious canines, in which case, we would be most prepared for it by being raised by wolves.

If understanding of our own Self is minimal, we are likely to encounter trouble applying the Golden Rule to others. Knowing thyself is also a power-up for our theory of mind.

In any of these cases, we are better off recognizing that no matter how hard we try, our mental models of others are just templates. They don’t give us the ability to know what another individual is thinking. At best, they are a weathervane that gives us some general sense of what might be going on in another’s head. The rest of the journey toward understanding them must be walked through mutual communication.

### The Theory of Mind in a FLUX World

Mentalization, or the theory of mind, is our capacity to recognize that other people have beliefs, emotions, thoughts, and desires. It's an essential aspect of being human, allowing us to navigate social landscapes by imagining the mental states of others.

We instinctively create mental models of people around us, using these models to predict their behaviors. The maturity of these models dictates our success or failure in social interactions. Imagine using stick-figure sketches to understand others; our social predictions would be mostly wrong, leading to constant faux pas.

Conversely, the more intricate our models, the better we perform in theory of mind. Accurate predictions enable us to build relationships and thrive in society. 

However, here lies the conundrum: humans are exceedingly complex. Constructing a perfect mental model of even a single person is impossible, as per Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety, which posits that a system cannot model a system of equal or greater complexity. So, we must rely on templates—simplified mental models we apply to others. 

One of these templates is ourselves. Depending on our stage of adult development, this might be the most intricate model we possess. Other models include significant individuals like parents, siblings, mentors, or even adversaries. The diversity and accuracy of these models largely determine our social efficacy. Growing up among well-rounded individuals equips us with a variety of templates suitable for modern society. Yet, if we were raised by wolves, our social tools would be attuned to a more primal context.

Understanding oneself is crucial for applying the Golden Rule effectively. A deep self-awareness enhances our theory of mind, yet even the best templates are just that—templates. They don't grant us omniscience over another's thoughts. They act as weathervanes, providing a general sense of another's mind. The journey toward true understanding requires mutual communication.

In the FLUX perspective, we embrace the limits of our mental models. By acknowledging their imperfections, we remain open to continual learning and adaptation, fostering genuine connections in an ever-changing social landscape【4†source】.
