I am a VP of software engineering who has decided to fire a director of software engineering. I need to write a message to my HR partners informing them of this. This grounds for the decision is that the director has a track record of interactions with others that leave the situation worse or leave the others not wanting to work with him. Each incident is individually fairly minor, and the director has been responsive to the feedback about the specific actions he should take, but the pattern of him not earning the trust of his stakeholders persists. At the end of the day, I cannot trust him to handle challenging conversations without my needing to intervene and do damage control. Please draft the message, using ALL CAPS to indicate areas where I should input additional details. The message should be 1-2 short paragraphs long. It should be something that could stand up to scrutiny if the director were to see it as part of the termination process.

Subject: Termination of Employment for [DIRECTOR'S FULL NAME]

Dear [HR PARTNER'S NAME],

I am writing to inform you of the decision to terminate the employment of [DIRECTOR'S FULL NAME], our current Director of Software Engineering, effective [TERMINATION DATE]. Despite [DIRECTOR'S FIRST NAME]'s responsiveness to feedback and willingness to adjust his actions when guided, there persists a significant concern regarding his pattern of interactions with colleagues and stakeholders. These interactions, though minor when viewed in isolation, collectively contribute to a deteriorating work environment. They have consistently resulted in situations that require intervention and damage control, ultimately leading to a loss of trust and confidence among his peers and subordinates.

Despite efforts to address these issues through feedback and guidance, the essential trust and effectiveness required for his role have not been established. This pattern of behavior has inhibited our team's ability to operate efficiently and collaboratively, necessitating this difficult decision. Please proceed with the necessary steps to formalize this termination, ensuring that all legal and procedural requirements are met with the utmost respect and confidentiality.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and your support during the termination process.

Best regards,

[YOUR FULL NAME]

This comes across as using a somewhat passive voice. Rewrite it to use a more active voice. Add space for referencing specific examples for me to fill in later.

Subject: Termination of Employment for [DIRECTOR'S FULL NAME]

Dear [HR PARTNER'S NAME],

I have decided to terminate [DIRECTOR'S FULL NAME]'s employment as our Director of Software Engineering, effective [TERMINATION DATE]. Despite direct feedback and opportunities to adjust his approach, [DIRECTOR'S FIRST NAME] continues to engage in behaviors that negatively impact his team and stakeholders. These behaviors, while minor individually, collectively undermine the trust and effectiveness necessary for his role. Specific examples include [EXAMPLE 1], [EXAMPLE 2], and [EXAMPLE 3], where his actions required significant intervention and damage control.

This repeated pattern of behavior has eroded the foundational trust needed for his position, leading to our decision to terminate his employment. We must act to preserve the team's integrity and productivity. Please ensure we handle this termination with the necessary legal and procedural rigor, maintaining respect and confidentiality throughout the process.

Thank you for your support in managing this sensitive situation.

Create another variation that modifies the decision to terminate to something like, "his performance is not meeting his high bar and we need to discuss next steps"

Subject: Discussion on [DIRECTOR'S FULL NAME]'s Performance and Next Steps

Dear [HR PARTNER'S NAME],

I am reaching out to address concerns regarding [DIRECTOR'S FULL NAME]'s performance as our Director of Software Engineering. Despite receiving direct feedback and clear guidance for improvement, [DIRECTOR'S FIRST NAME] has not met the high standards required for his role. His interactions with team members and stakeholders, detailed in instances such as [EXAMPLE 1], [EXAMPLE 2], and [EXAMPLE 3], consistently require further intervention and have led to a decline in trust and collaboration within our team.

This pattern of behavior, while not egregious in isolation, cumulatively impacts our team's effectiveness and morale. It is clear we need to discuss the next steps for [DIRECTOR'S FIRST NAME], considering the persistent gap between his performance and the expectations for his position.

I propose we schedule a meeting to explore all possible options, including developmental opportunities, role adjustments, or other measures that might address these ongoing issues. It is crucial that we approach this situation with a focus on both [DIRECTOR'S FIRST NAME]'s professional growth and the overall health of our engineering team.

Thank you for your support and guidance as we navigate this challenging situation.
