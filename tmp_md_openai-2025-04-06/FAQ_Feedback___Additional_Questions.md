We are making an org structure change where one head of engineering is going back to an IC role and his responsibilities are being moved to the other head of engineering (me). The org has been through a lot of change in the last year, including a large restructuring in August that was accompanied by some layoffs. There are no layoffs associated with this reorg. We are working on the FAQ. Assume that people understand what team names mean and who the people mentioned are. 

Read this draft FAQ and suggest other questions people might think of. Also provide feedback on the questions and the answers provided. 

Q: Why are we making this change?
Steve loves building things, and finds it incredibly energizing. He wanted to make this change, so we’re letting him!

Q: How does this change Steve’s day-to-day responsibilities? 
Steve will spend the majority of his time on coding & architecture, at least for the first few months.

Q: Who does Steve report to now?
Currently Quinn Slack, but Steve does not care where he reports in, so we will change it as convenient for everyone.

Q: Is Steve still part of the exec team?
Steve will be an occasionally-visiting member similar to Samantha Mandell and Amie Rotherham.

Q: Should we feel confident in the current Cody roadmap? Any changes being made there now that Erika is leading the team?
We are confident in the roadmap, but there are also some details (e.g., the Cody Platform) that need further exploration in order to fully flesh out the roadmap. We intentionally chose to incur tech debt to meet our PLG and Enterprise GA timelines, and paying that down continues to be part of planning.
The leadership team reviewed the PFP work plans with this change in mind, and while we cannot promise that our plans won’t change, it won’t be because of the leadership change. 

Q: I used to go to Steve for X, should I now go to Erika for that?
In general, yes!
For GTM, Steve is still available for the occasional customer call/demo, external events (e.g. podcasts), strat discussions, etc., within reason.
Erika is taking on all Head of Engineering responsibilities.

Q: What does this mean for the rest of the Cody org? Are there any other changes that we should know about?
To recap, the plan for the Cody is: 
To emphasize their commonalities and alignment, we will call the PLG, Enterprise, and Strat teams together the Cody Growth Engineering Teams
Cezary Bartoszuk will continue to manage Strat and Enterprise
David Veszelovszki will continue to manage PLG, with Bee Woo moving to PLG to provide client support and Chris Smith reporting to David Veszelovszki and continuing to work on PLG
The Clients, Context, and Services teams will report to Beyang and we’ll call it the Cody Product Experience team

Q: Does this impact any of Erika’s existing reporting/structure?
No. We are continuing to search for a manager for the Product Platform teams, Graph, Source, and Search Platform

Q: Are there any other changes we should know about?
Nope! This is just Steve moving into a new role that he’s very excited about.

Q: Why are Cody clients divided between Beyang (VS Code) and Steve (JetBrains and Neovim contractors)?
Mostly for expedience; for example, Steve happened to know JetBrains well already, and can supervise the contractors, so it made sense for him to do that for now.

Q: Are we hiring any new managers?
We eventually plan to hire a manager for this team, although we don’t have a concrete timeline. (But if you know someone perfect for the job, let Erika Rice Scherpelz know!)
