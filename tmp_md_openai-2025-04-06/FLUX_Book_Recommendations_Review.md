FLUX has reviewed a parenting book titled "A Data-Driven Guide to Better Decision Making in the Early School Years" by Emily Oster. This book stands out for its data-driven approach to parenting. As children grow older, parenting questions become less clear-cut and more dependent on context. Oster emphasizes that there is no one-size-fits-all method for making family decisions. The book distinguishes between day-to-day decisions, which can be delegated to individual caretakers, and larger decisions that require a more structured approach involving framing the question, gathering facts, making the decision, and revisiting it later.

A key aspect of this book is its focus on the "Big Picture" values of a family. These values, ranging from fundamental moral beliefs to practical considerations like family meal times or rules about snacks and desserts, guide both the day-to-day and larger decisions within the family. This approach reflects the complexity and individuality of family dynamics, recognizing that each family's values and principles play a crucial role in their decision-making processes【21†source】.
