what's a term in a system for when you jump between attractors?

In systems theory and dynamical systems, the phenomenon of **jumping between attractors** is often referred to as **"bifurcation," "hopping dynamics," or "attractor switching."** The specific terminology depends on the context:

1. **Bifurcation**: This occurs when a system's parameters change, causing a qualitative change in its dynamics and potentially shifting the attractor landscape. While it doesn't directly refer to "jumping," it describes a shift in the structure that makes such transitions possible.

2. **Attractor Hopping**: This term is sometimes used in complex systems, especially when noise or perturbations cause the system to move between multiple stable states (attractors).

3. **Stochastic Resonance**: In noisy systems, random fluctuations can push the system from one attractor to another. This is common in biological or ecological systems.

4. **Chaotic Transitions**: In systems exhibiting chaos, trajectories may appear to "jump" between different attractors in a phenomenon known as "crisis-induced intermittency."

5. **Phase Transition**: While more common in physics, a phase transition can involve a system shifting from one stable equilibrium to another, often interpreted as attractor switching on a macroscopic scale.

Would you like to explore any of these in more detail, or consider examples in a specific field (e.g., climate science, neural networks, or economics)?
