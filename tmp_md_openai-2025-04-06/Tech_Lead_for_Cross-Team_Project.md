For a technical project lead working on a project that spans multiple engineering teams, various titles and terms could apply, depending on the organization's structure, the project's complexity, and the industry. Here are several terms that might be used:

1. **Technical Program Manager (TPM)**: Focuses on managing complex, cross-functional technical projects or programs. TPMs often have a strong technical background combined with project management skills, enabling them to understand and navigate the technical challenges and dependencies of a project.

2. **Engineering Manager**: While typically focused on managing a single engineering team, in some organizations, Engineering Managers may lead projects that involve multiple teams, especially if the project is highly technical and requires close coordination between teams.

3. **Technical Project Manager**: Similar to a TPM, but the emphasis might be more on the project management aspects than on deep technical expertise. This role still requires a good understanding of the technical challenges and the ability to work across different engineering disciplines.

4. **Cross-Functional Project Lead**: This term emphasizes the cross-functional nature of the role, leading projects that require coordination across various engineering and possibly non-engineering teams.

5. **Integration Manager**: For projects that involve integrating systems, software, or processes across multiple teams, an Integration Manager might be the term used. This role focuses on ensuring that different components work together seamlessly.

6. **System Architect / Technical Architect**: While primarily focused on the design aspects of a project, in some cases, System or Technical Architects may take on a leadership role in projects that involve significant architectural changes or the integration of multiple systems across teams.

7. **Lead Technical Coordinator**: This term emphasizes the coordination aspect of the role, managing the technical interfaces between different teams to ensure that the project moves forward smoothly.

8. **Portfolio Technical Lead**: In organizations where projects are grouped into portfolios based on certain criteria (e.g., technology domain, business area), this role leads technical projects across different teams within a specific portfolio.

9. **Technical Lead (Tech Lead)**: While often associated with leading the technical direction of a single team, in some contexts, a Tech Lead might oversee the technical aspects of a project involving multiple teams, especially if the project is highly technical.

10. **Program Technical Director**: For very large projects or programs, this title might be used to denote the senior technical leadership role responsible for overseeing all technical aspects of the program across multiple teams.

The choice of term depends on the organization's specific structure, the industry, and sometimes the culture of the company. These roles can have overlapping responsibilities, and in some cases, the titles are used interchangeably.
