As an AI, I don't have real-time or current internet access and my training only includes knowledge up to September 2021, so I can't provide the specific differences between the third and fourth edition of "Understanding Exposure" if it was updated after that point.

However, typically when books, especially educational or instructional ones, are updated to a new edition, some changes could include:

1. **Updated information**: New editions often include the most recent information and developments in the field. For photography, this could include new camera technology, techniques, or theories.

2. **Additional content**: A new edition may have entirely new sections or chapters that were not included in the previous edition. For example, the fourth edition might cover topics that have become more relevant or important since the third edition was published.

3. **Revised content**: Some content from the previous edition may have been revised for accuracy, clarity, or depth.

4. **Removed content**: Information that is deemed out-of-date or less relevant may be removed in newer editions.

5. **Structural changes**: The organization or structure of the book may change. Chapters might be rearranged, or the flow of the content could be altered to improve understandability.

6. **Visual improvements**: New editions often come with improved graphics, photos, diagrams, or other visual aids, especially for a photography book like "Understanding Exposure".

For the specific changes between the third and fourth editions of "Understanding Exposure", I recommend checking the preface or introduction to the fourth edition, as many authors include a summary of the changes and updates. If this is not available, consider reaching out to the publisher or checking their website, as they often provide a list of updates when a new edition is released.
