Define the recall@n and precision@n search quality metrics

"Recall@n" and "Precision@n" are metrics used to evaluate the quality of search systems, often in the context of information retrieval, recommender systems, and machine learning.

1. **Recall@n**: 
   - **Definition**: Recall@n measures the proportion of relevant items that are retrieved among the top 'n' results in a search query.
   - **Formula**: Recall@n = (Number of relevant items retrieved in top n results) / (Total number of relevant items).
   - **Usage**: It's used to assess how many of the total relevant items are captured in the top 'n' search results. High recall@n means the search system is good at retrieving most of the relevant items within the top 'n' results.

2. **Precision@n**: 
   - **Definition**: Precision@n measures the proportion of relevant items among the top 'n' results returned by a search query.
   - **Formula**: Precision@n = (Number of relevant items retrieved in top n results) / (Total number of items retrieved in top n results).
   - **Usage**: It's used to assess the accuracy of the top 'n' results. High precision@n means that most of the top 'n' search results are relevant.

In practical terms:
- A system with high **recall@n** but low **precision@n** retrieves many relevant items but also many irrelevant ones.
- A system with high **precision@n** but low **recall@n** retrieves few irrelevant items but also misses many relevant ones.
- The ideal search system balances both metrics, effectively retrieving most relevant items (high recall) while minimizing irrelevant ones (high precision) among the top 'n' results.
